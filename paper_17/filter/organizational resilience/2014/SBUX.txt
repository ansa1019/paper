item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below. if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operation.
•   economic conditions in the us and certain international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.
as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions. our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to starbucks or competitors' lower priced products as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, higher taxes and reduced access to credit. decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales de-leveraging, which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales, net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis.
•   our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value, either through our actions or those of our business partners, could have a negative impact on our financial results.
we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs. our brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. to be successful in the future, particularly outside of the us, where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.
additionally, our business strategy, including our plans for new stores, foodservice, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, particularly in our international markets. licensees and food service operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages, food and other products directly to customers. we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial pressures they may face. we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees and food services providers as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a company-operated store, licensed store or food service location. we also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly.
business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust, such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy, contaminated food, recalls or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media, or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing or content of our products, fail to comply with laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets. additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.
•   the unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.
our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs, and for administrative functions, as well as the information technology systems of our third party business partners and service providers, can contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. security breaches of our or a third party's information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customers' or employees' data or that of the company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable us and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to these incidents, which could also result in similar exposure to liability. significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. these costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third party business partners or service providers, even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred, can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. like many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems but none have resulted in a material breach. additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. we continue to make significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.
•   incidents involving food-borne illnesses, food tampering, food contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business.
instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food-borne illnesses, food tampering, food contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. any report linking us to the use of unclean water, food-borne illnesses or food tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our beverages and food products, and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages. clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee and tea beverages and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. we have also incorporated many products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, including produce (such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices), dairy products (such as milk and cheeses) and meats. if customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food-safety issues, we could also be forced to temporarily close some stores and/or supply chain facilities, as well as recall products. in addition, instances of food-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. a decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores or recalls, as well as adverse results of claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations.
some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds, the health effects of which are the subject of public scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. particularly in the us, there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products. while we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations.
•   we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:
•   successfully leveraging starbucks brand portfolio outside the company-operated store base, including our increased focus on international licensed stores;
•   focusing on relevant product innovation and profitable new growth platforms, including retail tea, and achieving customer acceptance of these new products and platforms while maintaining demand for our current offerings;
•   continuing the growth of our channel development business;
•   balancing disciplined global store growth and existing store renovation while meeting target store-level unit economics in a given market;
•   executing a multi-channel advertising and marketing campaign to effectively communicate our message directly to starbucks consumers and employees; and
•   strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures.
in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could adversely impact our business and financial results, include construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the us and internationally; lack of customer acceptance of new products due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs; the degree to which we enter into, maintain, develop and are able to negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements; not successfully consummating favorable strategic transactions or integrating acquired businesses; or the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives. if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiatives, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including other intangibles and goodwill, have become impaired. in the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.
additionally, effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model, increase our focus on our channel development business, and expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality raw materials, to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience.
•   we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.
the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. in the us, the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. increased competition in the us packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment. additionally, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, could have a negative effect on our business.
•   we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our americas operating segment.
our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 73% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2014. if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders.
•   we are increasingly dependent on the success of our cap and emea operating segments in order to achieve our growth targets.
our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our cap and emea operating segments. some or all of our international market business units ("mbus"), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate. in particular, our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both net revenues and earnings for our cap segment and our japan mbu contributes significantly to earnings in that segment. in the emea segment, our uk mbu accounts for a significant portion of the net revenues. a decline in performance of any of these mbus could have a material adverse impact on the results of our international operations.
additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of the cap and emea segments are different than those affecting our us stores and licensees. tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the us or other international markets. occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the us due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations, such as in the us. additionally, our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market.
our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:
•   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies;
•   changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets;
•   interpretation and application of laws and regulations;
•   restrictive actions of foreign or us governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the us and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;
•   import or other business licensing requirements;
•   the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;
•   limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new us and international regulations;
•   in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast;
•   difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets;
•   local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees;
•   delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share; and
•   disruption in energy supplies affecting our markets.
moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects.
•   increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
we purchase, roast, and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and has and may again increase significantly due to one or more of the factors described below. the high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the "c" price. this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. increases in the "c" coffee commodity price do increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base "c" coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. these are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts. the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have an adverse impact on our profitability. in addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats and energy, are important to our operations. increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, especially in international markets, could have an adverse impact on our profitability.
•   our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control.
our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could adversely impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations:
•   increases in labor costs such as increased health care costs, general market and minimum wage levels and workers' compensation insurance costs;
•   adverse outcomes of litigation; and
•   especially in our larger or fast growing markets, labor discord, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, boycotts, social unrest, and natural disasters, including health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores.
•   interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.
any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, or natural disasters that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability.
additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. we rely on these suppliers and vendors to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. our ability to find qualified suppliers and vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us. a vendor's or supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, and comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. these issues could negatively impact our business and profitability.
•   failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales, operating cash flows, and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. in addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.
•   the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results.
much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. we must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives, some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional company-operated store model. our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior in-store experience. accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. if we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.
•   we rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and could adversely affect our financial results.
we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, starbucks cards, online business, mobile payments, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions. our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems. we also rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. although we have security measures in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third party software, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks. if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results.
•   failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could harm our business and financial results.
our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the sec, nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, privacy, food, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure to comply with the various laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september 30. the fiscal years ended on september 28, 2014, september 29, 2013 and september 30, 2012 all included 52 weeks. all references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.
financial highlights
•   global comparable store sales grew 6% driven by a 3% increase in the number of transactions and a 3% increase in average ticket.
•   consolidated operating income increased to $3.1 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to an operating loss of $325.4 million in fiscal 2013. fiscal 2014 operating margin was 18.7% compared to (2.2)% in fiscal 2013. the operating margin expansion was primarily due to lapping the $2.8 billion kraft litigation charge in the prior year. the remaining change in operating margin was primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, mainly coffee.
•   earnings per share for fiscal 2014 increased to $2.71, compared to eps of $0.01 in fiscal 2013, primarily due to lapping the kraft litigation charge, which reduced eps by $2.25 per share in fiscal 2013. the remaining increase was primarily due to the improved sales leverage and lower commodity costs, as well as a gain on the sale of our equity interest in our malaysia joint venture.
•   cash flows from operations were $607.8 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2013. the decline in fiscal 2014 was driven by the payment of $2.8 billion during the year for the kraft arbitration matter. this was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $3.4 billion resulting from strong earnings and favorable changes in working capital accounts in the current year.
•   capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013.
overview starbucks results for fiscal 2014 demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully execute new growth initiatives in a disciplined manner. all reportable segments contributed to strong revenue growth and collectively drove an increase in consolidated operating income and operating margin expansion.
the americas segment continued its strong performance in fiscal 2014, with revenues growing 9% to $12.0 billion, primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 6%, comprised of a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in number of transactions. enhanced food offerings, including the full rollout of our la boulangetm food platform in the us, the impact of price increases in our retail stores and successful promotional beverages contributed to the growth in comparable store sales. americas operating margin grew 190 basis points to 23.4% in fiscal 2014, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs. looking forward, we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion through new stores and continued product innovation, targeted at driving growth across all geographies and all dayparts. we plan to continue to expand our beverage platforms and elevate our food program, in part with continued enhancements to our lunch options.
in the emea segment, fiscal 2014 benefited from the significant performance improvement of this segment, reaching double-digit revenue growth and increased profitability compared to the prior year. revenues grew 12% to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange and comparable store sales growth of 5%. incremental revenues from 180 net new licensed store openings over the past year also contributed. emea operating margin expanded 370 basis points to 9.2% in fiscal 2014, primarily due to sales leverage and continued cost management, largely driven by the shift in our store portfolio to more licensed stores in this segment. we expect our continued disciplined licensed store expansion and focus on the customer experience in this region will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid-teens operating margin over time.
our china/asia pacific segment results reflect the growth and strong performance of new stores in the region, including 250 company-operated and 492 licensed net new store openings over the past year. this new store growth, along with a 7% increase in comparable store sales, drove a 23% increase in total net revenues to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2014. operating income grew $51.3 million, or 16%, to $373 million compared to the prior year. operating margin declined 200 basis points primarily resulting from the shift in the composition of our store portfolio in this segment to more company-operated stores. we expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to overall company profitability in the future. we look forward to continued new store openings and the acquisition and integration of starbucks japan, including expanding our presence into other channels in the japan market, such as cpg, licensing and foodservice. we also expect that china will continue to grow toward being one of our largest markets outside of the us.
channel development segment revenues grew 11% to $1.5 billion, in fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products. lower coffee costs was the primary contributor to the 630 basis point increase in operating margin for fiscal 2014. as we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores, including growing our presence in the premium single-serve category, we expect this segment to become a more significant contributor to future growth.
fiscal 2015 - the view ahead for fiscal 2015, we expect revenue growth of 16% to 18%, including 6% to 7% of incremental growth from the acquisition of starbucks japan. the remaining growth will primarily come from mid-single-digit global comparable store sales growth and the addition of approximately 1,650 net new stores. approximately one-half of net new store openings will be in our china/asia pacific segment, with the remaining half coming primarily from the americas.
we expect consolidated operating margin to decline slightly in fiscal 2015 when compared to our fiscal 2014 results, primarily due to the mildly dilutive margin impact of the acquisition of starbucks japan, largely driven by the change in business model from a joint venture to a company-operated market. we expect strong eps growth in fiscal 2015, due in part to an anticipated acquisition-related gain of approximately $325 million to $375 million after-tax, or $0.43 to $0.49 per share, resulting from a fair value adjustment of our current 39.5% ownership interest in starbucks japan. we expect sales leverage to also contribute to the eps growth.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 is expected to be approximately 31%, including a net tax benefit of approximately 4% from the acquisition of starbucks japan.
capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, primarily for new stores and store renovations, as well as for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives.
acquisitions and divestitures see note 2, acquisitions and divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.
results of operations - fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013
consolidated results of operations (in millions):

total net revenues were $16.4 billion for fiscal 2014, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2013, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.2 billion). the growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $641 million) and incremental revenues from 555 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $529 million).
licensed store revenue growth contributed $228 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, as a result of improved comparable store sales and the opening of 1,029 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months.
cpg, foodservice and other revenues increased $168 million, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products (approximately $111 million) and increased foodservice sales (approximately $17 million).

the litigation charge of $2,784.1 million in fiscal 2013 reflects the charge we recorded as a result of the conclusion of the arbitration with kraft. this charge included $2,227.5 million in damages and $556.6 million in estimated interest and attorneys' fees. the $20.2 million litigation credit recorded in fiscal 2014 reflects a reduction to our estimated prejudgment interest payable associated with the kraft arbitration as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated.
income from equity investees increased $17 million, primarily due to improved performance from our joint venture operations in china, south korea, and japan, as well as improved performance from our north american coffee partnership joint venture, which produces, bottles and distributes our ready-to-drink beverages.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin to 18.7% compared to (2.2)% in the prior year period.

net interest income and other increased $19 million over the prior year, primarily due to a net benefit from transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, driven by a gain on the sale of our equity interest in our malaysia joint venture (approximately $68 million), favorable fair value adjustments from derivatives used to manage our risk of commodity price and foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $14 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations (approximately $9 million), and realized gains on sales of investments (approximately $6 million). these increases were partially offset by lapping gains on the sales of our equity interests in our joint ventures in chile and argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $45 million) and in mexico in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $35 million).
interest expense increased $36 million due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 34.6% compared to 103.8% for fiscal 2013. the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to lapping the 71.2% impact of the litigation charge associated with the kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013. for additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge, see note 13, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k. the remaining change in the effective tax rate over fiscal 2013 was an increase of 2.0%, which was primarily due to net higher discrete benefits in the prior year. in fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate benefited from releasing certain tax reserves that did not recur in fiscal 2014 and a net tax benefit from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2014 was additional tax resulting from the sale of our australian company-operated retail store assets and operations and our 50% equity interest in our malaysia joint venture.

store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points. as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 90 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage in our americas segment (approximately 90 basis points) and store portfolio optimization initiatives in europe that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately 50 basis points). this was partially offset by the addition of teavana and continued investment in our emerging brands (approximately 60 basis points).
other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points. as a percentage of non-company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 80 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 50 basis points) and decreased marketing expenses (approximately 20 basis points).
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by increased costs to support overall company growth and the costs related to our october global leadership conference.
income from equity investees increased $41 million, primarily due to increased income from of our joint venture operations in japan and china, as well as improved performance from our north american coffee partnership joint venture, which produces, bottles and distributes our ready-to-drink beverages.
litigation charge of $2,784.1 million reflects the accrual we recorded as a result of the conclusion of the arbitration with kraft. this charge includes $2,227.5 million in damages and $556.6 million in estimated interest and attorneys' fees.
the combination of the above resulted in an operating loss of $325.4 million and operating margin of (220) basis points.

net interest income and other increased $29 million over the prior year, primarily due to gains on the sale of the equity in our chile and argentina joint ventures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $45 million) and in mexico in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $35 million). these gains were partially offset by the absence of additional income recognized in the prior year associated with unredeemed gift cards following a court ruling related to state unclaimed property laws (approximately $29 million). also offsetting the gains were unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments in fiscal 2013 compared to favorable mark-to-market adjustments in fiscal 2012 from derivatives used to manage our risk of commodity price fluctuations (approximately $24 million).
income taxes for fiscal year 2013 resulted in an effective tax rate of 103.8% compared to 32.8% for fiscal year 2012. the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the litigation charge associated with the kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013. for additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge, see note 13, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k. excluding the impact of the litigation charge, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to benefits from releasing certain tax reserves in fiscal 2013 and a further benefit in fiscal 2013 primarily relating to state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. these items were partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits relating to coffee procurement in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash and investment overview starbucks cash and investments were $2.2 billion and $3.3 billion as of september 28, 2014 and september 29, 2013, respectively. in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we paid $2.8 billion for the kraft arbitration matter that was accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. we actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including government treasury securities (foreign and domestic), corporate bonds, mortgage and asset-backed securities, state and local government obligations, agency obligations and certificates of deposit. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio was liquidated in anticipation of funding the acquisition of starbucks japan, ltd ("starbucks japan") in fiscal 2015, discussed further in note 18, subsequent event. as of september 28, 2014, approximately $1.4 billion of cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.
borrowing capacity in december 2013, we issued $400 million of 3-year 0.875% senior notes ("the 2016 notes") due december 2016, and $350 million of 5-year 2.000% senior notes ("the 2018 notes") due december 2018, in an underwritten registered public offering, to fund a portion of the payment required by the arbitration award in the kraft litigation matter. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on june 5 and december 5 of each year, commencing on june 5, 2014. see note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for details of the components of our long-term debt.
the indentures under which all of our senior notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. as of september 28, 2014, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
our $750 million unsecured, revolving credit facility with various banks, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases, and is currently set to mature on february 5, 2018. we may request, and the banks may grant, at their discretion, increases to the credit facility by a total additional amount of up to $750 million. borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for us dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the company's long-term credit ratings assigned by moody's and standard & poor's rating agencies, and (ii) the company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit facility. the current applicable margin is 0.795% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.00% for base rate loans. the credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. as of september 28, 2014, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of september 28, 2014.
under our commercial paper program, as approved by our board of directors, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion, with individual maturities that may vary, but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility. currently, we may issue up to $727 million under our commercial paper program (the $750 million committed credit facility amount, less $23 million in outstanding letters of credit). the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of $225 million to fund a portion of the $2.8 billion payment for the kraft arbitration matter. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of $25 million to fund other corporate purposes. there were no other commercial paper borrowings during fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013.
use of cash in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, starbucks paid all amounts due to kraft under the arbitration, including prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees, and fully extinguished the litigation charge liability. of the $2,784.1 million litigation charge accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, $2,763.9 million was paid and the remainder was released as a litigation credit in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to reflect a reduction to our estimated prejudgment interest payable as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated.
we expect to use additional available cash and investments, including additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including new product innovations and related marketing support, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees. we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees. any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.
we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding.
as described further in note 18, subsequent event, in september 2014, we entered into a tender offer bid agreement with starbucks japan and our joint venture partner, sazaby league, ltd., to acquire the remaining 60.5% ownership interest in starbucks japan for approximately $893 million, through a two-step tender offer. in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we funded the first tender offer step with approximately $511 million in offshore cash. we also expect to fund a majority of the second tender offer step with offshore cash. we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future.
we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of september 28, 2014 to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no us income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. we have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the us, we would be subject to additional us income taxes, which could be material. we do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect, and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.
other than normal operating expenses and funding the acquisition of starbucks japan for approximately $893 million, cash requirements for fiscal 2015 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new company-operated stores; remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; and additional investments in manufacturing capacity. total capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion.
during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2013, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.21 per share. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share. cash dividends paid in fiscal 2014 and 2013 totaled $783.1 million and $628.9 million, respectively. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we declared a cash dividend of $0.32 per share to be paid on november 28, 2014 with an expected payout of approximately $239.8 million.
during fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we repurchased 10.5 million and 10.8 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $769.8 million and $544.1 million, respectively, under share repurchase authorizations. the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at september 28, 2014 totaled 15.9 million.
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $607.8 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $2.9 billion for fiscal 2013. the decrease was driven by the first quarter payment of $2.8 billion for the kraft arbitration matter discussed above. this was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $3.4 billion primarily resulting from strong earnings and favorable changes in working capital accounts in the current year.
cash used by investing activities totaled $817.7 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2013. the change was primarily due to cash paid to acquire teavana in the prior year. also contributing was an increase in our investments in long-term securities during fiscal 2014, more than offset by the subsequent liquidation of a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 in anticipation of funding the acquisition of starbucks japan.
cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2014 totaled $623.3 million, compared to $108.2 million for fiscal 2013. the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividend payments in fiscal 2014 and decreased proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the related excess tax benefits, resulting from fewer stock option exercises during the period.
contractual obligations our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 28, 2014, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions):
payments due by period contractual obligations (1)                total             less than 1year              1 - 3years              3 - 5years            more than5 years operating lease obligations(2)      $4,957.9                  $925.6                  $1,522.9                $1,007.1                  $1,502.3
(1)   income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. as of september 28, 2014, we had $121.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, which includes accrued interest and penalties.
(3)   amounts exclude any gain or loss upon settlement of related interest rate swap agreements, which are described further in note 3, derivative financial instruments.
(4)   purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on starbucks and that specify all significant terms. green coffee purchase commitments comprise 90% of total purchase obligations.
(5)   other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments.
starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.

commodity prices, availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole-bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. in addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. for additional details see product supply in item 1, as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10-k.
financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. we manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. in general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of three years.
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 28, 2014 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income ("oci") from changes in commodity prices. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars. however, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us, we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the canadian dollar, japanese yen, chinese renminbi, british pound, and euro. to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated revenue streams and inventory purchases in currencies other than our functional currency, the us dollar, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. see note 3, derivative financial instruments, for further discussion.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 28, 2014 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income ("oci") from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

equity security price risk we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our trading securities portfolio. trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. our trading securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan ("mdcp"), which is included in accrued compensation and related costs, within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. changes in our mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 28, 2014 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
interest rate risk long-term debt we utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to anticipated debt issuances. as of september 28, 2014, we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding.
the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 28, 2014 on the fair value of starbucks debt (in millions):

application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k. we believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.
we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. during the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.
property, plant and equipment and other definite-lived assets we evaluate property, plant and equipment and other definite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. when evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. for company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. the fair value of a store's assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. for other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.
our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. for company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store's historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store's performance. the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance.
during fiscal 2014, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. however, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trade names and trademarks) for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. when evaluating for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group. fair value is the price a market participant would pay for the reporting unit or intangible asset and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a discounted cash flow or relief-from-royalty method. if the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value.
our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments. during fiscal 2014, as part of our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we performed the qualitative assessment for approximately $104 million, or 12%, of our total goodwill balance of $856.2 million, the majority of which resides in our china retail, us licensed and us consumer packaged goods reporting units.
as part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. we may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount when determining any loss on disposal. our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. as a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur.
our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when performing a qualitative assessment or when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values typically include projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as selecting an appropriate discount rate. for indefinite-lived intangible assets, management also makes assumptions around the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee. for a goodwill reporting unit, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit's past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit's performance. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region. for indefinite-lived intangible assets, estimates of revenue growth are based on internal projections considering the intangible asset group's past performance and forecasted growth, and the royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rates for similar licensing arrangements, adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. these estimates are highly subjective judgments and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies.
for fiscal 2014, we determined the fair value of our material reporting units and intangible asset groups were significantly in excess of their carrying values. accordingly, we did not recognize any material impairment charges during the current fiscal year. during fiscal 2014, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. however, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future; however, we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements.
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. in projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss).
in addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when new information becomes available. there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations; however, we do not expect this change to be material to the consolidated financial statements.
we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to us income taxes. we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the us to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the us, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional us income taxes, which could be material. determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.
our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. we do not expect any of these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods.

risks related to our business and industry
•   consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.
this decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the continuing prevalence of illicit products. these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7, business environment.
•   cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.
tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. as a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.
increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and "illicit whites."
•   our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products.
governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase down-trading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband, "illicit whites" and legal cross-border purchases. significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the world health organization's framework convention on tobacco control ("fctc"). the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation. the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers. regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:
•   restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes;
•   the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;
•   restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;
•   the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;
•   restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging;
•   restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;
•   requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents;
•   disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients;
•   restrictions on the sale of novel tobacco or nicotine-containing products;
•   elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers; and our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands, in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements.
•   litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity.
there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in brazil, canada and nigeria, range into the billions of u.s. dollars. we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. it is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. see item 8, note 18. contingencies ("note 18. contingencies") for a discussion of pending litigation.
•   we face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, r&d, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps. we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in algeria, egypt, the prc, taiwan, thailand and vietnam. industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates.
•   because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters or conflicts.
some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. in others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. economic, political, regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities. in addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings.
in certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes, and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability.
in addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners.
•   we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns.
our business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. to be successful, we must:
•   promote brand equity successfully;
•   develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;
•   improve productivity;
•   ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and in periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation.
•   we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, "illicit whites" and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers.
large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. in addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband, legal cross-border purchases, "illicit whites" and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers.
•   from time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.
investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of customs duties and/or excise taxes, allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising. we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. see note 18. contingencies-other litigation and item 7, business environment-governmental investigations for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject.
•   we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reduced-risk products, and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or the communication of scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims.
our key strategic priorities are: to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps. for our efforts to be successful, we must: develop rrps that such adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking; conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking; and effectively advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps, including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices. we might not succeed in our efforts. if we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. furthermore, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale and/or marketing of rrps with scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims. such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps.
•   we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.
to date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. if we cease to be successful in these efforts, rrp unit margins may be adversely affected.
•   our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness.
we conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer u.s. dollars. during periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the u.s. dollar, reducing our margins. actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position.
•   changes in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls.
the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the u.s. tax system. our estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act is based on management's current interpretations, and our analysis is ongoing.  our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates due to developments such as implementing regulations and clarifications. in future periods, our effective tax rate and our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments. furthermore, changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into u.s. dollars or to make payments outside the country. this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption.
•   our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.
our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.
•   we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships.
one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings.
•   government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.
as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves. any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.
•   our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking.
•   the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them or our failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other confidential data.
we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs. failure to protect personal data and respect the rights of data subjects could subject us to substantial fines under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation.
•   we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources.
in certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a. risk factors.
description of our company we are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the united states of america. we are building our future on smoke-free products that are a much better consumer choice than continuing to smoke cigarettes.  through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. our vision is that these products ultimately replace cigarettes to the benefit of adult smokers, society, our company and our shareholders.
our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. we have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. our portfolio comprises both international and local brands. in addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products ("rrps"). rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.  we have a range of rrps in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.  because our rrps do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.
for all periods presented in this report, we managed our business in four segments:
to provide a greater focus on both parts of our business -- combustible and reduced-risk products -- and to support our transformation toward a smoke-free future, effective january 1, 2018, we are managing our business in six reportable segments as follows:
•   south &amp; southeast asia - includes indonesia, the philippines and other markets in this region;
•   east asia &amp; australia - includes australia, japan, south korea, the people's republic of china and other markets in this region, as well as malaysia and singapore; and we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to governments, and, in those circumstances, we include the excise taxes in our net revenues and in excise taxes on products. our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs, as well as the cost of the iqos devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers.
our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. the most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.
philip morris international inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. as a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. our principal wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock.
consolidated operating results
•   net revenues and net revenues, excluding excise taxes on products - the changes in our net revenues, and net revenues, excluding excise taxes, for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable 2016 amounts, were as follows:
net revenues include $3.8 billion in 2017 and $739 million in 2016 related to the sale of rrps, mainly driven by japan. these net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers, where we collect and remit the excise tax. excluding excise taxes, net revenues for rrps were $3.6 billion in 2017 and $733 million in 2016. in some jurisdictions, including japan, we are not responsible for collecting excise taxes.
•   diluted earnings per share - the changes in our reported diluted earnings per share ("diluted eps") for the year ended december 31, 2017, from the comparable 2016 amounts, were as follows:
diluted eps   % growth for the year ended december 31, 2016       $4.48
2016 asset impairment and exit costs           -
subtotal of 2016 items                         -
2017 asset impairment and exit costs           -
subtotal of 2017 items                     (0.84     )
change in tax rate                         (0.03     )
income taxes - our effective income tax rate for 2017 increased by 12.8 percentage points to 40.7%. the 2017 tax items that decreased our diluted eps by $0.84 per share in the table above were primarily due to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act, which was signed into law in december 2017.
the principal elements of the tax cuts and jobs act relevant to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2017, were:
•a reduction of the u.s. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; and in connection with these elements of the tax cuts and jobs act, we recognized a provisional expense of $1.6 billion, which was included as a component of income tax expense as follows:
•   a provisional charge of $1.4 billion, which represents the transition tax of $2.2 billion, net of a reversal of $0.7 billion of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities on part of the accumulated foreign earnings, and other items of $0.1 billion.
•   re-measurement of u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities using a rate of 21%, which, under the tax cuts and jobs act, is expected to be in place when such deferred assets and liabilities reverse in the future. in connection with this re-measurement, we recorded a provisional charge of $0.2 billion.
while the impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act reduced net earnings by $1.6 billion, there was no net impact on operating cash flows for the year, as the changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable offset the net earnings impact. at december 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax payable of $1.7 billion representing the transition tax of $2.2 billion, partially offset by foreign tax credits related to foreign withholding taxes previously paid of $0.5 billion. the income tax payable is due over an 8-year period beginning in 2018. for further details, see item 8, note 11. income taxes to our consolidated financial statements.
the change in the effective tax rate that decreased our diluted eps by $0.03 per share in the table above was primarily due to earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.
currency - the unfavorable currency impact during 2017 results from the fluctuations of the u.s. dollar, especially against the brazilian real, egyptian pound, euro, japanese yen and turkish lira, partially offset by the russian ruble. this unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.
interest - the favorable impact of interest was due primarily to higher interest income, partly offset by higher average debt levels.
operations - the increase in diluted eps of $0.47 from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments:
•   asia: favorable volume/mix, higher pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs; and
•   latin america &amp; canada: higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix;
partially offset by
•   eema: unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by higher pricing; and
•   european union: unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by higher pricing.
for further details, see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis.
2018 forecasted results - on february 8, 2018, we announced our forecast for 2018 full-year reported diluted eps to be in a range of $5.20 to $5.35, representing a projected increase of approximately 34% to 38% at prevailing exchange rates, versus $3.88 in 2017. excluding a favorable currency impact, at then-prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.16 per share for the full-year 2018, the forecast range represents a projected increase of approximately 7% to 10% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 in 2017.
•   net revenue growth, excluding excise taxes, of over 8.0%, excluding currency;
•   operating cash flow of over $9.0 billion;
•   capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion; and following the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act, our 2018 full-year diluted earnings per share forecast -- based on the current interpretation of the legislation -- assumes a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 28%, subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction. the difference between the 21% statutory rate under the new law and our effective rate reflects the fact that we operate in markets outside the united states and is driven by three main factors: foreign tax rate differences, non-deductibility of interest expense and a partial disallowance of foreign tax credits related to the application of the rules for global intangible low-taxed income.
we calculated 2017 adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps of $3.88, plus the $0.84 per share charge related to tax items. during 2017, we did not have an eps impact related to asset impairment and exit costs.
adjusted diluted eps is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"). we define adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, tax items and unusual items. we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings, improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. adjusted diluted eps should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted eps prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
this 2018 guidance excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments related to the tax cuts and jobs act, and any unusual events. the factors described in item 1a. risk factors represent continuing risks to these projections.

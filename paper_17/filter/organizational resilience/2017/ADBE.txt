item 1a.  risk factors as previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. these and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.
if we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.
the process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and uncertain. if we fail to anticipate customers' rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. we must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. if we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. additionally, any delay in the development, acquisition, marketing or launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position.
we offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms. consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices. if we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed. releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or operating systems. these potential costs and delays could harm our business.
our competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively.
the markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, disruptive technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of charge). any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. furthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness, and access to larger customer bases. as a result of these advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share. in addition, consolidation has occurred among some of our competitors. further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive pressures and may harm our results of operations.
for additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled "competition" contained in part i. item 1 of this report.
introduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.
the expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving. our future success depends on a variety of factors, including our continued ability to innovate, introduce new products and services efficiently, enhance and integrate our products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. integration of our products and services with one another and other companies' offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on third parties. if any disruptive technology, or competing products, services or operating systems that are not compatible with our solutions, achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer and our business could be harmed.
the introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. for example, some of our products rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements. we use these cookies to help our customers more effectively advertise, gauge the performance of their advertisements, and detect and prevent fraudulent activity. consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or "ad-blocking" software or applications. the most common internet browsers allow consumers to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. increased use of methods, software or applications that block cookies could harm our business.
some of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.
sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our adobe experience cloud solutions and etlas in our digital media business, are multi-phased and complex. the complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors, including:
•   the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment;
•   the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures;
•   the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services;
•   the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts;
•   the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations due to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments within customers' organizations; and
•   customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.
we spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. as we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could have a greater impact on our results of operations.  additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarter's total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry.  our extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.
subscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.
we generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which range from 1 to 36 months. as a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter. declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue in future quarters. lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term.
additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of etlas, a number of factors could affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-element revenue arrangements and alternative licensing arrangements. if any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.
if our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results could suffer.
our adobe experience cloud, creative cloud, and document cloud offerings typically involve subscription based offerings pursuant to product and service agreements. revenue from our subscription customers is generally recognized ratably over the term of their agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and customers may not renew their subscriptions at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration of the terms. our varied customer base combined with the flexibility we offer in the length of our subscription-based agreements complicates our ability to precisely forecast renewal rates. therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rates.
our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription offerings, the prices of offerings and those offered by our competitors, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers' spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.
security breaches in data centers we manage, or third parties manage on our behalf, may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of employee and customer data, which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our reputation and business.
we process and store significant amounts of employee and customer data, most of which is hosted by third-party service providers. a security incident impacting our own data centers or those controlled by our service providers may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of this data. unauthorized access to or disclosure of data stored by adobe or our service providers may occur through break-ins, breaches of a secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. it is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers or employees. accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. additionally, failure by customers to remove accounts of their own employees, or the granting of accounts by the customer in an uncontrolled manner, may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer representatives. if there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the information we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities, regulatory investigations, or fines. in addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.
we rely on data centers managed both by adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, as well as access, collect, use, transmit, and store data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or transmission could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.
much of our business relies on hardware and services that are hosted, managed, and controlled directly by adobe or third-party service providers, including our online store at adobe.com, creative cloud, document cloud, and experience cloud solutions. we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. if our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our customers, which could subject us to reputational harm, costly and time intensive notification requirements, and cause us to lose customers and future business. occasionally, we migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments. if a transition among data centers or to third-party service providers encounters unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity, or unplanned disruptions despite precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our delivery of products and services to customers and result in increased costs and liabilities, which may harm our operating results and our business.
it is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with regulatory notification requirements. furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. in addition, computer viruses, worms, or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation or regulatory investigation, and costly and time intensive notification requirements.
we may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software. if we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers or those of third parties, service outages could occur and our customers could suffer impaired performance of our services. such a strain on our infrastructure capacity could subject us to regulatory notification requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments, financial liabilities, result in customer dissatisfaction, or harm our business. if we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers, or we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.
increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability.
u.s. privacy and data security laws apply to our various businesses. we also do business globally in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the united states that may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. globally, new laws, such as the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") in europe, and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability (and our enterprise customers' ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction, and deletion of their personal information), and to implement our business models effectively. these new laws may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). these requirements, among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. any perception of our practices, products or services as a violation of individual privacy rights may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. additionally, we store information on behalf of our customers and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us.
transferring personal information across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. for example, european data transfers outside the european economic area are highly regulated. the mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for european data transfers (e.g. privacy shield and model clauses) are being contested in the european court system. we are closely monitoring developments related to requirements for transferring personal data outside the eu. these requirements may result in an increase in the obligations required to provide our services in the eu or in sanctions and fines for non-compliance. several other countries, including australia and japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information. these developments in europe and elsewhere could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.
maintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. security researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach our data security systems and misused some of our systems and software in order to access our end users' authentication and payment information. in addition, cyber-attackers also develop and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools, and other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, systems, computers or networks. sophisticated hardware and operating system applications that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair a customer's ability to operate or use our products. the costs to prevent, eliminate, notify affected parties of, or alleviate cyber- or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. it is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us.
outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products or services to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems or attempt to gain logical access to our products, services, or information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data. these actual and potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, our customers or their end users, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. this may result in litigation and liability or fines, our compliance with costly and time intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand and reputation. these risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products and services, and store and process more data, including personal information.
these problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. critical vulnerabilities may be identified in some of our applications. these vulnerabilities could cause such applications to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system, which could result in liability to us or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our products and services to customers. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures quickly enough to prevent cyber-attackers from gaining unauthorized access into our systems and products. despite our preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims), and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services, to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. if we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customers require, our business could be adversely affected. customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. further, if we or our customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is used in a third-party attack, we could be subject to costly and time intensive notice requirements, and it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative steps. any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or margins. moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks or preventative measures could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an investment or acquisition of a company, division, product or technology, each of which involves numerous risks. these risks include:
•   inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;
•   difficulty in, and the cost of, effectively integrating the operations, technologies, products or services, and personnel of the acquired business;
•   entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•   disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities and challenges;
•   inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;
•   inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
•   inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;
•   incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;
•   elevated delinquency or bad debt write-offs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;
•   increased accounts receivables collection times and working capital requirements associated with acquired business models;
•   additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to a multinational corporation;
•   impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our technologies, products or services;
•   failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology;
•   exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, such as claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;
•   incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;
•   inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;
•   inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions;
•   the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
•   delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offerings; and
•   incompatibility of business cultures.
mergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky. if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.
changes in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.
we prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. a change in these principles, how the principles are interpreted, or the adoption of new accounting principles can have a significant effect on our reported results, and could even retroactively affect previously reported transactions, and may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.
changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls. for additional information regarding these updated standards, see the section titled "recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective" within part ii. item 8, note 1. basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies.
such changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and income, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively impact our financial results.
changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.
we are a u.s.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while, as of the balance sheet date, we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
in addition, in the united states, the european commission, countries in the european union and other countries where we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these countries and other governmental bodies have or could make unprecedented assertions about how earnings in their jurisdictions might be determined that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. in the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service ("irs") and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. these tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
the success of some of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.
the success of some of our product and service offerings, such as adobe stock, depends on our ability to continue to attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content, as well as our ability to continue to retain existing customers and contributors. an increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. we rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers and contributors and retain existing ones. new technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.
we face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.
as a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the americas, we are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad;
•   increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
•   changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
•   changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;
•   failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;
•   the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business;
•   operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and
•   other factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.
some of our third-party business partners have international operations and are also subject to these risks and if our third-party business partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks, our business may be harmed. if sales to any of our customers outside of the americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.
we are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business.
we are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally. these laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. for example, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by u.s. regulations applicable to us, including the foreign corrupt practices act. we cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, and business partners will not take actions in violation of our internal policies or u.s. laws. compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.
in addition, approximately 52% of our employees are located outside the united states. accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various u.s. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs.
uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.
as our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both domestically and globally. uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. if economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. this could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. among our customers are government entities, including the u.s. federal government, and our revenue could decline if spending cuts impact the government's ability to purchase our products and services. deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
a disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management and affect our derivative counterparties. any of these events would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value. preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. we actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. if piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business. we apply for patents in the u.s. and internationally to protect our newly created technology and if we are unable to obtain patent protection for the technology described in our pending patent, or if the patent is not obtained timely, this could result in revenue loss, adverse effects on operations, and harm to our business. we offer our products and services in foreign countries and we may seek intellectual property protection from those foreign legal systems. some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or comprehensive of intellectual property protection laws and schemes as those offered in the u.s. in some foreign countries, the mechanisms to enforce intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our technology, which could harm our business.
if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could lose future trade secret protection for that source code. the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. however, there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights may be difficult or costly.
we have been, are currently, and may in the future be, subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation relating to disputes regarding the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention of management and key personnel. we may not prevail in every lawsuit or dispute. third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. in addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.
our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global scope of our business. we attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. we regularly review our program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and make adjustments as necessary. our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
failure of our third-party customer service and technical support providers to adequately address customers' requests could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.
our customers rely on our customer service support organization to resolve issues with our products and services. we outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. we depend heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. this strategy presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if these third-party organizations are based overseas. if we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers and associated revenue.
failure to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.
we contract with a number of software distributors and other strategic partners, none of which is individually responsible for a material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period. nonetheless, if any single agreement with one of our distributors were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. our distributors and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior.
we cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively. if our distribution channel is not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue. our distributors also sell our competitors' products and services, and if they favor our competitors' products or services for any reason, they may fail to market our products or services effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. we also distribute some products and services through our oem channel, and if our oems decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer. in addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in economic conditions, which could result in insolvency, the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services, or a delay in paying their obligations to us.
we also sell some of our products and services through our direct sales force. risks associated with this sales channel include more extended sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of ongoing training for sales representatives. moreover, recent hires may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity. our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. in addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.
contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.
we provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of government entities, both domestically and internationally. risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include more extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.
revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.
in the past, the market price for our common stock experienced significant fluctuations and it may do so in the future. a number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, such as:
•   shortfalls in, or changes in expectations about our revenue, margins, earnings, annualized recurring revenue ("arr"), sales of our adobe experience cloud offerings, or other key performance metrics;
•   changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
•   compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology saas companies;
•   the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements, service introductions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or our competitors;
•   the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new customers;
•   recruitment or departure of key personnel;
•   variations in our or our competitors' results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and developments in our industry;
•   general socio-economic, political or market conditions; and
•   unusual events such as significant acquisitions by us or our competitors, divestitures, litigation, regulatory actions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.
in addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general may experience uneven investor confidence, which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating performance. volatility in the market price of a company's securities for a period of time may increase the company's susceptibility to securities class action litigation. oftentimes, this type of litigation is expensive and diverts management's attention and resources which may adversely affect our business.
if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.
much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management. these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to adobe. the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, especially if we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. our business is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas where our employees are located. we may experience higher compensation costs to retain senior management and experienced personnel that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sales. if we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.
we continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related expenditures. nonetheless, as globalization continues, competition for these employees in these countries has increased, which may impact our ability to retain these employees and increase our expenses resulting from competitive compensation. we may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities, which would require significant management attention and resources. we may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, causing our results to suffer.
we believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. as we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
gaap requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. in addition, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. depending on the results of our review, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.
we have issued $1.9 billion of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.
we have $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding. we also have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is currently undrawn. this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:
•   increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions;
•   requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.
in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such financing and restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
we are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and website for our development, marketing, operations, support, hosted services and sales activities. in addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. a disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country's or region's demand for our products. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the san francisco bay area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations are located in the salt lake valley area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
while we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted. access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority. our major sites in california, utah and india are vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. in the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited access to these resources, we have the potential to experience losses to our business, and added costs to resume operations.
our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.
our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of december 1, 2017 consisted of corporate bonds and commercial paper, foreign government securities and u.s. treasury securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time deposits and asset-backed securities. we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.
should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. in addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. as of december 1, 2017, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions, market liquidity or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
acquisitions during fiscal 2017, we completed our acquisition of tubemogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for $560.8 million. as of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate tubemogul into our digital marketing reportable segment.
during fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and hd videos, for $807.5 million. during fiscal 2015, we integrated fotolia into our digital media reportable segment.
we also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 acquisitions as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material.
see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. on a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. most of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. throughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes allowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. in response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and to provide support at each stage of the customer's life cycle.
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; we have delivered the product or performed the service; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collection is probable. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.
for our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe"); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. absent vsoe, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. however, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. in determining vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.
for multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of selling price, third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price or best-estimated selling price ("besp"), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
for multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price, if it exists, or tpe of selling price. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use besp. once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.
we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non-software elements and as such, we use besp. besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded. in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.
in the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.
we recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service ("irs") and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. we expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
in addition, in the united states, the european commission, countries in the european union and other countries where we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these countries and other governmental bodies have or could make unprecedented assertions about how earnings in their jurisdictions might be determined that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. in the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. these tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us.
results of operations overview of 2017
for fiscal 2017, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.
in our digital media segment, we are a market leader with creative cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. creative cloud delivers value through frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our adobe stock and behance services, app creation capabilities and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
we offer creative cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. we expect creative cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users on account of creative cloud's low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. we have also built out a marketplace for creative cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our adobe stock service. overall, our strategy with creative cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.
we continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our creative cloud offerings. these strategies include increasing the value creative cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to creative cloud. because of the shift towards creative cloud subscriptions and enterprise term license agreements ("etlas"), revenue from perpetual licensing of our creative products has been immaterial to our business.
we are also a market leader with our adobe document cloud offerings built around our adobe acrobat family of products, the adobe reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including adobe sign. acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. document cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes adobe acrobat dc and adobe sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. adobe acrobat dc, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.
annualized recurring revenue ("arr") is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall digital media segment. arr should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as arr is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. we adjust our reported arr on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. our reported arr results in fiscal 2017 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2017 and held constant throughout the year. we calculate arr as follows:
creative arr         annual value of creative cloud subscriptions and services+ annual digital publishing suite contract value + annual creative etla contract value document cloud arr   annual value of document cloud subscriptions and services +annual document cloud etla contract value digital media arr    creative arr+ document cloud arr creative arr exiting fiscal 2017 was $4.63 billion, up from $3.52 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. document cloud arr exiting fiscal 2017 was $600 million, up from $472 million at the end of fiscal 2016. total digital media arr grew to $5.23 billion at the end of fiscal 2017, up from $3.99 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. revaluing our ending arr for fiscal 2017 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2018, our digital media arr at the end of fiscal 2017 would be $5.39 billion or approximately $154 million higher than the arr reported above.
our success in driving growth in arr has positively affected our revenue growth. creative revenue in fiscal 2017 was $4.17 billion, up from $3.18 billion in fiscal 2016 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. document cloud revenue in fiscal 2017 was $836.7 million, up from $764.9 million in fiscal 2016 and representing 9% year-over-year revenue growth as we continue to transition document cloud to a subscription-based model. total digital media segment revenue grew to $5.01 billion in fiscal 2017, up from $3.94 billion in fiscal 2016 and representing 27% year-over-year growth.
we are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our digital marketing segment. our digital marketing business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. these comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. in march 2017, we migrated our hierarchy of solutions under what was formerly known as adobe marketing cloud to our next generation offering referred to as adobe experience cloud.
adobe experience cloud consists of the following cloud offerings:
•   adobe marketing cloud-provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes adobe experience manager ("aem"), adobe campaign, adobe target, adobe social and adobe primetime.
•   adobe analytics cloud-enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all adobe clouds through the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data into singular customer profiles; includes adobe analytics and adobe audience manager.
•   adobe advertising cloud-delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional tv and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens; combines capabilities from adobe media optimizer ("amo") and adobe's acquisition of tubemogul during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
in addition to chief marketing officers and digital marketers, users of our adobe experience cloud solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, digital marketers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers and marketing executives. these customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other adobe products, such as our digital media offerings. by combining the creativity of our digital media business with the science of our digital marketing business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.
we utilize a direct sales force to market and license our adobe experience cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. we have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. we achieved record adobe experience cloud revenue of $2.03 billion in fiscal 2017, which represents 24% year-over-year growth.
financial performance summary for fiscal 2017
•   total digital media arr of approximately $5.23 billion as of december 1, 2017 increased by $1.24 billion, or 31%, from $3.99 billion as of december 2, 2016. the change in our digital media arr was primarily due to strong adoption of our creative cloud and adobe document cloud offerings.
•   creative revenue of $4.17 billion increased by $997.8 million, or 31%, during fiscal 2017, from $3.18 billion in fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings.
•   adobe experience cloud revenue of $2.03 billion increased by $398.9 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2017, from $1.63 billion in fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to increases in revenue associated with our advertising cloud offerings, including tubemogul which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and increases in subscription revenue associated with our adobe marketing cloud offerings, including aem and adobe campaign.
•   our total deferred revenue of $2.49 billion as of december 1, 2017 increased by $479.8 million, or 24%, from $2.01 billion as of december 2, 2016. the increase was primarily due to increases in creative cloud team and individual subscriptions, and new contracts and the timing of renewals for our adobe experience cloud services.
•   cost of revenue of $1.01 billion increased by $190.6 million, or 23%, during fiscal 2017, from $819.9 million in fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to increases in media costs associated with our advertising cloud offerings, data center and hosting costs and increased headcount.
•   operating expenses of $4.12 billion increased by $582.0 million, or 16%, during fiscal 2017, from $3.54 billion in fiscal 2016. the increase was primarily due to increased headcount and stock based compensation expense.
•   net income of $1.69 billion increased by $525.2 million, or 45%, during fiscal 2017 from $1.17 billion in fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in subscription revenue.
•   net cash flow from operations of $2.91 billion during fiscal 2017 increased by $713.1 million, or 32%, from $2.20 billion during fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher net income.
revenue for fiscal 2016 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2017 and 2015, which were 52-week years.

fiscal 2017 revenue compared to fiscal 2016 revenue digital media revenue from digital media increased $1.07 billion during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings.
revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our creative cloud, perpetually licensed creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2017. the increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings driven by increases in individual, team and enterprise subscriptions. also contributing to the increase in revenue was revenue growth associated with our creative cloud photography plan subscription offering.
adobe document cloud revenue, which includes our acrobat product family and adobe sign service, increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in document cloud subscriptions revenue, offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetually licensed acrobat offering. also contributing to the increase in document cloud revenue was an increase in adobe sign revenue.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $383.4 million during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our adobe experience cloud. the increase in subscription revenue was driven by strong performance with our adobe marketing cloud offerings, which include aem and adobe campaign, and our adobe analytics cloud offerings, which includes audience manager. also contributing to the increase in adobe experience cloud revenue were increases in revenue associated with our adobe advertising cloud offerings, including tubemogul which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
fiscal 2016 revenue compared to fiscal 2015 revenue digital media revenue from digital media increased $845.8 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings.
revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our creative cloud, perpetually licensed creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings driven by increases in the number of paid creative cloud individual and team subscriptions, and continued adoption of our etlas. to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our creative cloud photography plan subscription offering and stock photography offerings also contributed to the increase in revenue associated with our creative offerings. increases associated with our creative offerings were slightly offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings and distribution of third-party software downloads.
document cloud revenue, which includes our acrobat product family and adobe sign service, decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to expected decreases in revenue associated with our acrobat perpetual license offering. decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue associated with our document cloud subscription offerings as we continue to migrate more customers to our document cloud, along with increases in adobe sign revenue.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $227.7 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our adobe experience cloud, which increased 20% year over year. increases in adobe experience cloud revenue were largely driven by the continued adoption of our aem offerings and, to a lesser extent, the increase in revenue associated with adobe campaign. also contributing to the increase in digital marketing revenue was the increase in adobe analytics cloud revenue.

fiscal 2017 revenue by geography compared to fiscal 2016 revenue by geography overall revenue during fiscal 2017 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in digital media and digital marketing revenue. within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. further, the overall increase in emea revenue was slightly offset by declines due to the relative strength of the u.s. dollar against emea currencies as discussed below.
fiscal 2016 revenue by geography compared to fiscal 2015 revenue by geography overall revenue during fiscal 2016 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases in digital media and digital marketing revenue, slightly offset by a decrease in print and publishing revenue. within each geographic region, fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. further, the overall increase in emea revenue was partially offset by declines due to the relative strength of the u.s. dollar against emea currencies as discussed below.
included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.
revenue impact:                       increase/(decrease)

during fiscal 2017, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the british pound, which negatively impacted revenue in emea measured in u.s. dollar equivalents. the net foreign currency impact to revenue was offset in part by hedging gains from our emea and japanese yen currencies hedging programs during fiscal 2017.
during fiscal 2016, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the euro and british pound which negatively impacted revenue in emea measured in u.s. dollar equivalents. this impact was partially offset by hedging gains from our emea currencies hedging programs during fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2016, the u.s. dollar weakened against the japanese yen, the impact of which was offset by the impact of the u.s. dollar strengthening against other asian currencies.
see note 17 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further geographic information.
backlog deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year, non-cancelable commercial subscription, saas and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing subscription, saas and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. as of december 1, 2017, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.94 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2018. comparatively, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.42 billion as of december 2, 2016, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2017.
we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, saas and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

subscription cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of certain intangible assets and allocated overhead. we enter into contracts with third parties for hosting services and use of data center facilities. our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar items. cost of subscription revenue also includes media costs related to impressions purchased from third-party ad inventory sources for our adobe advertising cloud offerings.
cost of subscription revenue increased due to the following:
% change          % change hosting services and data center costs                                7                 9

media costs increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to our tubemogul advertising platform offerings, which are part of the adobe advertising cloud and were acquired through our acquisition of tubemogul in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. royalty costs increased due to increases in obligations to certain key vendors for technology use.
hosting services and data center costs increased in all periods presented primarily due to the continued increase in transaction volumes in our adobe experience cloud and creative cloud offerings.
the increase in cost of subscription revenue during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 were partially offset by decreases in amortization of purchased intangibles driven by the decrease in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions of omniture and efficient frontier that became fully amortized in the latter part of fiscal 2015.
product cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.
as a result of redirecting our focus and development efforts towards our creative cloud and adobe experience cloud subscription offerings, our cost of product revenue declined in all periods presented due to the following:
% change             % change amortization of purchased intangibles      (7     )%          (16   )%

amortization of purchased intangibles during the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. as a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.
amortization expense remained relatively consistent during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the decreases associated with certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions were offset by increases associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of tubemogul in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
amortization expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the write-off of certain acquired intangible assets from a previous acquisition and the increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased in fiscal 2016.

as described in note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements, we early adopted the updated accounting standard for share-based payment accounting during fiscal 2017. as a result, we recorded deferred tax attributes that we were previously tracking pursuant to the rules that preceded this standard. the deferred tax asset recorded with the adoption was offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance.
our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was partially related to a one-time tax cost associated with licensing acquired company assets to our trading subsidiaries, offset in part by the recognition of excess tax benefits due to our adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation and the completion of certain income tax examinations. in addition to the above noted items, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations, and to a lesser extent, a one-time tax benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the fiscal 2015 u.s. research and development credit.
our effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and the permanent extension of the u.s. research and development credit for 2015 and onward. the reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to january 1, 2015. a tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. the decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. in addition, the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to adobe's trading companies, offset by tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the u.s. research and development credit in december 2014.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. currently, there is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which u.s. income taxes have not been provided.
see note 9 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $172.9 million, $178.4 million and $258.7 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which, $135.0 million, $144.5 million and $220.2 million if recognized, would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were net of the estimated $37.9 million, $33.9 million and $38.5 million federal benefits related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $23.6 million and $22.4 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. these amounts were included in non-current income taxes payable in their respective years.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $40 million.
liquidity and capital resources this data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows.
as of working capital                  $3,720.4                   $3,028.1
a summary of our cash flows is as follows:
net cash provided by operating activities                                   $2,912.9           $2,199.7           $1,469.5
effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents           8.5              (14.2    )         (21.2    )
our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. the primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. other sources of cash are proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.91 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by headcount growth, and increased accrued media costs associated with our advertising cloud offerings, including tubemogul. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, payments of trade payables assumed as part of the tubemogul acquisition, and a decrease in income taxes payable. trade receivables increased primarily due to revenue linearity, higher revenue levels, and increased media rebill receivables attributable to tubemogul. income taxes payable decreased primarily due to taxes paid in excess of the tax provision increase.
for fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes payable. trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. prepaid expenses and other current assets increased primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. income taxes payable decreased primarily due to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid.
for fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2017, net cash used for investing activities of $442.9 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of tubemogul. other uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment, including the almaden tower and long-term investments and other assets. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
for fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments. other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets, and an immaterial acquisition. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
for fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of fotolia. other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment and long-term investments and other assets. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets.
see note 2 and note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions and the almaden tower purchase, respectively.
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock.
for fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
in january 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (the "2025 notes"). our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. in addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 notes using the effective interest method. the 2025 notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
we used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2015 ("2015 notes"). the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information.
in addition to the 2025 notes issuance and 2015 notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 included payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. see the section titled "stock repurchase program" discussed below.
we expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.
other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2018 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. our cash and investments totaled $5.82 billion as of december 1, 2017. of this amount, approximately 89% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. as of our balance sheet date, our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if u.s. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional u.s. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.
subsequent to december 1, 2017, the "tax cuts and jobs act" (the "act") was enacted and included broad tax reforms that are applicable to adobe. under the provisions of the act, the u.s. corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, our undistributed foreign earnings amount of approximately $4 billion are subject to taxation in fiscal 2018 and are available for repatriation, and our future foreign earnings are subject to u.s. taxation. these changes will require us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities and reclassify approximately $380 million of deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings to long-term income taxes payable due over eight years. in addition, based on preliminary estimates, we anticipate a tax provision charge of approximately $85 million in fiscal 2018 predominately due to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings.
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors." however, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
on march 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement"), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. on march 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement by one year to march 2, 2018. on july 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the credit agreement to july 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the credit agreement. as of december 1, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.
as of december 1, 2017, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due february 1, 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 notes, the "notes").
our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, u.s. treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities. we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.
stock repurchase program to facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. in january 2017, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019.
during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.10 billion, $1.08 billion, and $625 million, respectively. we enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price ("vwap") of our common stock over a specified period of time. we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. during fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares at an average price per share of $134.20 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price per share of $97.16 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. during fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price per share of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.
for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by december 1, 2017, december 2, 2016 and november 27, 2015 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. as of december 1, 2017, $101.5 million of prepayments remained under the agreement.
subsequent to december 1, 2017, as part of the 2017 stock repurchase authority, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $300 million. this amount will be classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. upon completion of the $300 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.6 billion remains under our current authority.
see item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended december 1, 2017.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december 1, 2017 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. see note 14 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 1, 2017 (in millions):
operating lease obligations             525.1                    57.5                     120.5         95.6                  251.5
other subsequent to december 1, 2017, we purchased land near our headquarters in san jose, california for a total purchase price of $68 million.
senior notes as of december 1, 2017, our outstanding notes payable consist of the 2020 notes and 2025 notes with a total carrying value of $1.88 billion. interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on february 1 and august 1. at december 1, 2017, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the notes was $350.6 million for the remaining duration of our notes. in june 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 notes to a floating interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a fixed number of basis points through february 1, 2020.
covenants our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. as of december 1, 2017, we were in compliance with this covenant. we believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. our notes do not contain any financial covenants.
under the terms of our credit agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes see results of operations - provision for income taxes above for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
indemnifications in the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.
to the extent permitted under delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

item 1a. risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k. if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
summary of risk factors our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, discussed in more detail in the following section. these risks include, among others, the following key risks:
risks related to our business
•we invest significant resources in the research, development, manufacturing and supply of therapies for serious diseases other than cf, and if we are unable to successfully commercialize one or more of these therapies, our business could be materially harmed.
•all of our product revenues and the vast majority of our total revenues are derived from sales of medicines for the treatment of cf. if we are unable to continue to increase revenues from sales of our cf medicines or to eventually derive revenues from the sales of our pipeline products, our business would be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline.
•we have limited experience developing and commercializing cell and genetic therapies and could experience challenges with these programs, which could result in delays or prevent the development, manufacturing and commercialization of our cell and genetic therapies.
•if our competitors bring products with superior product profiles to market, our products may not be competitive and our revenues could decline.
•if we discover safety issues with any of our products or if we fail to comply with continuing u.s. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval or sales could be suspended, and our business could be materially harmed.
•if physicians and patients do not accept our products, or if patients do not remain on treatment or comply with their prescribed dosing regimen, our product revenues would be materially harmed in future periods.
risks related to pricing of our products
•government and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means. if they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.
•we may experience incremental pricing pressure on our products, which could reduce our revenues and future profitability.
•current health care laws and regulations in the u.s. and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the u.s. health care system may affect our ability to commercialize our marketed products profitably.
•we have experienced challenges commercializing products outside of the u.s., and our future revenues will be dependent on our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products.
risks related to development and clinical testing of our products and product candidates
•our product candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval, and our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop additional product candidates for both cf and non-cf indications.
•if we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining regulatory approval, we may incur additional costs, experience delays in commercialization, or be unable to commercialize our product candidates.
•if clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the product candidate could increase and the competitive position of the product candidate could be adversely affected.
•difficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates, and ultimately delay or prevent regulatory approval.
risks related to government regulation
•if regulatory authorities interpret any of our conduct, including our marketing practices, as being in violation of applicable health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
•if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs in the u.s., we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
•if our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our product candidates.
•we are subject to various and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal data, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business, result in fines and/or criminal penalties, and damage our reputation.
risks related to business development activities
•our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to engage in transactions and collaborations with other entities that add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities.
•we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies, and the integration following any such acquisition may disrupt our business and management.
•we face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and product candidates.
•we may not be able to attract collaborators or external funding for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates.
risks related to supply, manufacturing and reliance on third parties
•we depend on third-party manufacturers and our internal capabilities to manufacture our products and the materials we require for our clinical trials. we may not be able to maintain our third-party relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.
•we rely on third parties to conduct pre-clinical work, clinical trials and other activities, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements.
risks related to intellectual property
•if our patents do not protect our products or our products infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation which could result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products or substantial liabilities.
•uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, that are inherently costly and unpredictable.
•we may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.
risks related to our operations
•a variety of risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.
•if we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, our business could be materially harmed.
•a breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.
risks related to financial results and holding our common stock
•our effective tax rate fluctuates, and changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties, unfavorable resolution to the tax positions we have taken or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our future taxable income.
risks related to our business we invest significant resources in the research, development, manufacturing and supply of therapies for serious diseases other than cf, and if we are unable to successfully commercialize one or more of these therapies, our business could be materially harmed.
we invest significant resources in the research and development of medicines for serious diseases including scd, beta thalassemia, pain, amkd, t1d, aatd, dmd and dm1. some of these programs have progressed into clinical trials, while others are still in pre-clinical development. product development is highly uncertain and expensive, and we may experience unforeseen delays, including regulatory and commercialization delays. product candidates that may appear promising in the early phases of research and development may fail to reach commercial success for many reasons, including the failure to demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results or obtain marketing approval, the inability to manufacture or commercialize the product candidate on economically feasible terms, or the appearance of safety issues. for example, in october 2020, we decided not to progress vx-814, a drug candidate for the treatment of aatd, into further development based on safety and pharmacokinetic data observed in a phase 2 clinical trial.
even if we gain marketing approval for one or more pipeline products, we cannot be sure that we will obtain market acceptance or adequate reimbursement levels from third-party payors or foreign governments for such products. additionally, many of the therapies that we are developing in our pipeline target rare diseases that affect a limited number of patients. there can be no guarantee that we will effectively identify patients that are eligible for enrollment in our clinical trials or treatment with our product candidates. even if we do successfully identify eligible patients, the number of patients that our product candidates are able to treat may turn out to be lower than we expect or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify, each of which may adversely affect our revenues and materially harm our business. for these and other reasons, we may never be successful in expanding our pipeline and future revenue may continue to depend on sales of our cf medicines.
all of our product revenues and the vast majority of our total revenues are derived from sales of medicines for the treatment of cf. if we are unable to continue to increase revenues from sales of our cf medicines or to eventually derive revenues from the sales of our pipeline products, our business would be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline.
our net product revenues and the vast majority of our total revenues are derived from the sale of our cf medicines. as a result, our future success is largely dependent upon our ability to increase revenues from sales of our cf medicines. this will require us to continue to gain approval and reimbursement for trikafta/kaftrio in ex-u.s. markets, successfully develop and commercialize trikafta/kaftrio for younger children with cf or successfully develop and commercialize products from our pipeline.
our concentrated source of revenues presents a number of risks to our business, including:
•that one or more competing therapies may be developed successfully as a treatment for people with cf;
•that reimbursement policies of payors and other third parties may make it difficult to obtain reimbursement or reduce the net price we receive for our products;
•that we may experience manufacturing or supply disruptions for our cf medicines; and
•that we may experience adverse developments with respect to development or commercialization of our cf medicines and/or pipeline product candidates.
if any of the above risks were to materialize, if we are otherwise unable to increase revenues from sales of our cf medicines, or if we do not meet the expectations of investors or public equity market analysts, our business would be materially harmed and our ability to fund our operations could be adversely affected.
we have limited experience developing and commercializing cell and genetic therapies and could experience challenges with these programs, which could result in delays or prevent the development, manufacturing and commercialization of our cell and genetic therapies.
we are investing significant resources in the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of cell and genetic therapies, including exa-cel. while we have previously successfully developed, manufactured, and commercialized several small molecule drugs, we have limited experience with the development, manufacture, and commercialization of cell and genetic therapies. development, manufacturing, and commercialization of cell and genetic therapies are subject to similar risks and uncertainties as small molecules. in addition:
•the manufacturing processes for cell and genetic therapies are different, less mature and more complex than the manufacturing processes required for small molecule drugs and require investments in systems, equipment, facilities, and expertise to develop and maintain;
•we may encounter difficulties in the production of our cell and genetic therapies and ensuring that the product meets required specifications;
•there have been a limited number of regulatory approvals for genetic therapies to date, the regulatory requirements governing genetic therapies continue to evolve, and regulatory positions and interpretations can change or lead to delays or significant unexpected costs with respect to our genetic therapy programs;
•the commercial success of cell or genetic therapies, including exa-cel and vx-880, if approved, will depend in part on the medical community, patients, governments, and third-party or governmental payors accepting and providing adequate reimbursement for cell or genetic therapy products in general, and recognizing the applicable medicine as medically useful, cost-effective, ethical, and safe; and
•market acceptance will be dependent in part on the prevalence and severity of side effects associated with the procedure by which the cell or genetic therapy is administered, including, with respect to exa-cel and vx-880, if approved, the prevalence and severity of any side effects resulting from the myeloablative preconditioning regime or immunosuppression, respectively.
for programs addressing rare genetic diseases with small patient populations, we may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics, to complete our clinical studies in an adequate and timely manner. additionally, patients may be unwilling to participate in our clinical trials because of concerns that cell and genetic therapies are unsafe or unethical, negative publicity from adverse events in the biotechnology or gene therapy industries, or for other reasons, including competitive clinical studies for similar patient populations. moreover, adverse developments in clinical trials conducted by others of cell and genetic therapy products or products created using similar technology, or adverse public perception of the field of cell and genetic therapies, may cause the fda and other regulatory bodies to revise the requirements for approval of any cell or genetic therapy product candidates we may develop or limit the use of products utilizing technologies such as ours, either of which could materially harm our business.
as we advance our cell and genetic therapy product candidates, we will be required to consult with various regulatory authorities, and we must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, which may change from time to time, including during the course of development of our cell and genetic therapy product candidates. if we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue the clinical development of certain of our cell and genetic therapy product candidates. these additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected. even if we comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and even if we maintain close coordination with the applicable regulatory authorities with oversight over our cell and genetic therapy product candidates, our development programs may experience delays or fail to succeed. delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential cell or genetic therapy product to market would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
the regulatory approval process and clinical trial requirements for cell and genetic therapies can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied product candidates, and regulatory requirements governing cell and genetic therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. for example, the fda established the office of tissues and advanced therapies within its center for biologics evaluation and research ("cber") to consolidate the review of cell therapies and related products, and the cellular, tissue and gene therapies advisory committee to advise cber on its review. these and other regulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups, and the requirements and guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions.
to develop and commercialize cell or genetic therapies, including exa-cel, we are incurring substantial expenditures to develop, contract for, or otherwise arrange for the necessary supplies and manufacturing capabilities. additionally, the manufacture of cell and genetic therapies requires significant expertise. even with the relevant experience and expertise, manufacturers of cell and genetic therapy products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, and compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations. we cannot make any assurances that these problems will not occur, or that we will be able to resolve or address problems that occur in a timely manner, or at all.
to the extent we develop manufacturing capabilities internally, there are many risks that could result in delays and additional costs, including the need to hire and train qualified employees and obtain access to necessary equipment and third-party technology. to the extent we partner with third parties to manufacture our cell or genetic therapies, the complexity in the manufacture of our products and product candidates may require lengthy technology transfers. in addition, the third parties on which we rely to manufacture our cell or genetic therapies may experience their own compliance challenges or delays.
we are also devoting substantial resources to expand our commercial organization to prepare for the anticipated future product launches from our pipeline programs. for example, with respect to exa-cel, we are creating and developing the internal and external support systems to reach and support potential future patients, in addition to establishing and ensuring the necessary supply and manufacturing infrastructure. we cannot make any assurances that we will obtain approval for products from our pipeline programs, or that, if approved, a future product will generate substantial revenues and cash flows.
we also face uncertainty as to whether cell and gene therapy treatments will gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. if we obtain regulatory approval, the commercial success of cell and gene therapy treatments will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients, and third-party payors of gene therapy products in general, and our product candidates in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective, and safe. in particular, our success will depend upon physicians prescribing our product candidates in lieu of existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical data may be available. moreover, physicians and patients may delay acceptance of cell and gene therapy product candidates until the product candidates have been on the market for a certain amount of time. in addition, medical centers that administer procedures accompanying treatment could experience capacity constraints, and these centers are subject to competing priorities that could delay patient access to procedures associated with cell and gene therapy products. negative public opinion or more restrictive government regulations may delay or impair the successful commercialization of, and demand for, cell and gene therapies.
there also is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of cell or genetic therapy products, including gene therapies that are potential one-time treatments. it is difficult to predict what third party payors, including u.s. or ex-u.s. governments or private insurance companies, will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel cell and genetic therapies like the ones in our pipeline. additionally, reimbursement rates for cell and genetic therapies approved before ours could create an adverse environment for reimbursement of any therapies we ultimately commercialize. the administration of our products may require procedures for the collection of cells from patients, followed by other procedures either before or after delivery of the cell or genetic therapy. the manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for these services also is important. inadequate reimbursement for such services may adversely affect physicians' decisions to recommend any product for which we obtain approval in the future and our ability to market or sell the associated cell or genetic therapy.
given there are only a few approved cell and genetic therapy products, it also is difficult to determine how long it will take or reasonably estimate the costs to develop, manufacture, and commercialize cell or genetic therapies. in addition, our cell-based therapies include approaches involving devices, which are subject to additional regulatory requirements. if we are unable to successfully develop, manufacture, or commercialize such therapies on a timely or profitable basis, or at all, we may not realize benefits or generate cash flows based on our investments in these programs and our business, financial condition, results of operations and our stock price would likely be adversely affected.
if our competitors bring products with superior product profiles to market, our products may not be competitive and our revenues could decline.
a number of companies are seeking to identify and develop product candidates for the treatment of cf and other therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. our success in rapidly developing and commercializing our cf medicines may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of potential competitive treatments. if one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for people with cf or any of the other diseases we are currently targeting in our pipeline, our products and our net product revenues could face competitive pressures. if one or more competing therapies prove to be superior to our then existing products and/or product candidates, our business could be materially adversely affected.
in addition, our business faces competition from major pharmaceutical companies possessing substantially greater financial resources than we possess. we also face competition from numerous smaller public and private companies, academic institutions, government agencies, public and private research organizations, and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization.
mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. smaller and other early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
our products and any products that we develop in the future may not be able to compete effectively with marketed drugs or new drugs that may be developed by competitors. the risk of competition is particularly important to our company because substantially all of our revenues are related to the treatment of people with cf. there are many other companies developing products for the same patient populations that we are pursuing. to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and/or tolerability, ease of manufacturing, and gain and maintain market acceptance over competing products.
if we discover safety issues with any of our products or if we fail to comply with continuing u.s. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval or sales could be suspended, and our business could be materially harmed.
our products are subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of additional safety information. products are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained and therefore side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated, or were not as prevalent or severe, during pre-approval clinical trials or nonclinical studies. the subsequent discovery of previously unknown or underestimated problems with a product could negatively affect commercial sales of the product, result in restrictions on the product or lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market. each of our cf products shares at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient with another of our products. as a result, if any of our cf products were to experience safety issues, our other cf products may be adversely affected. the reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or public speculation about such events could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility. our business also may be materially harmed by impaired sales of our products, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, required label changes or additional clinical trials, reputational harm, or government investigations or lawsuits brought against us.
our products are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, export, recordkeeping, and submission of safety and other post-market information. we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with cgmp and other applicable regulations governing the manufacturing and distribution of our products. regulatory authorities periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities, and those of our third-party manufacturers, to evaluate compliance with cgmp and other regulatory requirements.
if we or our collaborators, or third-parties acting on our behalf, fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we or our collaborators may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for specific products, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.
in addition, treatment with some of our cell and genetic therapy product candidates, including exa-cel and vx-880, involve myeloablative preconditioning regimens or immunosuppression, and the patients in our clinical trials receiving these treatments may experience side effects (ranging from mild to severe) or adverse events. such events could have a significant negative impact on our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.
if physicians and patients do not accept our products, or if patients do not remain on treatment or comply with their prescribed dosing regimen, our product revenues would be materially harmed in future periods.
our medicines may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients or other members of the medical community. effectively marketing our products and any of our product candidates or investigational therapies, if approved, requires substantial efforts, both prior to launch and after approval. physicians may elect not to prescribe our products or recommend our cell or genetic therapies, and patients may elect not to take them or receive them or they may discontinue use of our products after initiation of treatment, for a variety of reasons including:
•prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;
•lack of reimbursement availability from third-party payors, including governmental entities;
•lack of cost-effectiveness;
•a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies in development that have significant perceived advantages over our product;
•convenience and ease of administration;
•the timing of market introduction of our product as well as competitive products;
•other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and
•inadequate sales, marketing and/or distribution support, including as a result of limitations or restrictions resulting from covid-19.
if our medicines fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenues in future periods.
we are dependent upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, these customers would adversely affect our results of operations.
in the u.s., we sell our cf products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors, which subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. internationally, we sell our products primarily through distributor arrangements and to a limited number of retail pharmacies or pharmacy chains, as well as to hospitals and clinics. we expect this significant customer concentration in cf to continue for the foreseeable future. our ability to generate and grow sales of our cf medicines will depend significantly on the extent to which these specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies are able to provide adequate distribution of our products to patients and healthcare providers. the loss of any large customer, a significant reduction in sales we make to them, any cancellation of orders they have made with us, or any failure to pay for the products we have shipped to them could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
risks related to pricing of our products government and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means. if they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.
sales of our products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. third-party payors include government health programs such as medicare and medicaid in the u.s. and the national health care systems in ex-u.s. markets, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. the trend in the health care industry is cost containment, and efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain appropriate prices for our products or any drugs that we may develop and commercialize.
in the u.s., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls that are similar to those that currently exist in europe. for example, the aca required manufacturers of medicare part d brand name drugs to provide discounts on those drugs to medicare part d beneficiaries during the coverage gap; increased the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies to state medicaid programs on drugs covered by medicaid; and imposed an annual fee, which increases annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. additionally, private payors, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers in the u.s., are adopting more aggressive utilization management techniques and are increasingly applying restrictive plan designs that can impact patients and manufacturers, and they continue to push for significant discounts and rebates from manufacturers.
additionally, on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act was enacted. the law establishes a drug price negotiation program, under which the government may negotiate maximum fair prices for certain drugs covered by medicare that do not have generic or biosimilar competition. the first set of maximum fair prices will be effective in 2026. certain products are excluded from the negotiation program including drugs that have a single orphan drug designation and that are not approved for any other orphan or non-orphan diseases or conditions. we cannot predict with certainty whether there will be future legislative changes to the scope of these exclusions. the law also requires manufacturers to pay a rebate to medicare if the price of a medicare drug (under both part b and part d) increases faster than the rate of inflation. the law also redesigns the part d benefit. the current coverage gap discount program, which requires manufacturers to provide a 70% discount on brand drugs and biologics during the coverage gap phase, will be eliminated after the 2024 plan year. starting in 2025, manufacturers of brand drugs and biologics will be required to provide a 10% discount during the initial phase and a 20% discount during the catastrophic phase of the part d benefit. the inflation reduction act continues a trend in the united states toward reducing drug prices and limiting spending by the federal health care programs on drugs. we cannot predict how cms will interpret the inflation reduction act or how the provisions of the law will affect our business once fully implemented, but it is possible that these changes or other legislative updates will have an adverse impact on our revenue. the inflation reduction act also requires the secretary of the department of health and human services to issue program guidance on numerous areas associated with implementation of the law's requirements, including for drug price negotiation and inflation rebates. we cannot know what form this program guidance would take or how it would affect our business.
it is possible the u.s. congress or administration may take further actions to control prescription drug pricing. for example, in october 2022, president biden issued an executive order, directing the center for medicare and medicaid innovation ("cmmi"), to consider new healthcare payment and delivery models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries. the executive order requires cmmi to submit a report to the white house on potential models.
third-party payors throughout the world also have been attempting to control drug spending in light of the global economic pressures, including due to covid-19. in reimbursement negotiations, many payors are requesting price discounts and caps on total expenditures and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover if they are not able to secure them. some payors restrict reimbursement to certain patient groups or by indication. as part of these negotiations, many ex-u.s. government payors also are requiring companies to establish product cost-effectiveness as a condition of reimbursement. these cost-effectiveness reviews may overlook many of the benefits provided by innovative medicines, and for the most part, have not taken into account the specific circumstances of products that treat rare diseases. this has led to conclusions that certain medicines, including our products in certain jurisdictions, are not cost-effective. as a result, certain countries have declined to reimburse, or delayed their reimbursement of, some of our products. although not mandated in the u.s., various organizations have started advocating for cost-effectiveness analyses in the u.s. as well as value-based contracting in which the amount of reimbursement for a product is based on patient outcomes and other clinical or economic metrics related to the performance of such product. if u.s. payors were to adopt such assessments and make negative coverage determinations or utilize value-based contracts that result in penalties to, or lower rates of, reimbursement, it could adversely affect our product revenues. our business would be materially adversely affected if we are not able to obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement of our products from third-party payors on a broad, timely, or satisfactory basis, or if such coverage is subject to overly broad or restrictive utilization management controls.
the increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals for rare diseases, combined with their higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, is generating significant third-party payor interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. government regulations in both u.s. and ex-u.s. markets could further limit the prices that can be charged for our products and may limit our commercial opportunity. the increasing use of cost-effectiveness assessments in markets around the world and the financial challenges faced by many governments may lead to significant adverse effects on our business.
we may experience incremental pricing pressure on our products, which could reduce our revenues and future profitability.
there also has been an increase in state legislation and regulations related to drug pricing and drug pricing transparency. in the u.s., various states, including nevada, maryland, louisiana, new york, california, washington, massachusetts, new jersey, connecticut, vermont, new hampshire, utah, minnesota, oregon, colorado, new mexico, virginia, maine, texas, north dakota, and west virginia, have passed legislation requiring companies to disclose extensive information relating to drug prices, drug price increases, and spending on research, development, and marketing, among other things. although it is not always clear what states will do with the collected information, some laws were designed to obtain additional product discounts. additionally, certain states have enacted laws establishing prescription drug affordability boards ("pdabs"). some state pdabs either have the authority or have defined a pathway where they may be granted the authority, to establish upper payment limits for prescription drugs-although to date, none of the states have exercised this authority. we may continue to see more state action requiring additional disclosures or other actions. in addition, we could see increased federal activity related to drug pricing and transparency requiring disclosures or other actions instead of, or in addition to, state requirements. similar initiatives also are occurring in, or being considered by, some of our ex-u.s. markets, including italy and brazil.
complying with these laws can be expensive and requires significant personnel and operational resources. furthermore, any additional required discounts would adversely affect the pricing of, and revenues from, our products. finally, while we seek to comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements, we face increased enforcement activity by the u.s. federal government, state governments, and private payors against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for pricing and reimbursement-related issues as well as inquiries from the u.s. congress.
•rulemaking related to importation of prescription drugs from canada, as well as guidance related to importation of prescription drugs from other foreign countries;
•executive orders relating to drug pricing that are intended to broadly impact the pharmaceutical industry;
•changes to the federal anti-kickback statute safe harbors that eliminate anti-kickback statute discount safe harbor protection for certain manufacturer rebate arrangements; and
•legislation relating to drug pricing, including enhanced transparency measures into drug pricing.
we expect government scrutiny over drug pricing, reimbursement, and distribution to continue. potential future government regulation of drug prices or reimbursement creates uncertainties about our portfolio and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
current health care laws and regulations in the u.s. and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the u.s. health care system may affect our ability to commercialize our marketed products profitably.
the u.s. government, individual states and some foreign jurisdictions also have been aggressively pursuing legislative and regulatory reforms that could affect our ability to sell products. for example, in the u.s., there have been federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify, or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca, which could affect coverage and payment for medicines. the federal government additionally has proposed and enacted legislation leading to aggregate reductions of medicare payments to providers, which ultimately could affect utilization of medicines.
other reforms include the bipartisan budget act of 2018, which contained various provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drugs, including an increase in the discount that manufacturers of medicare part d brand name drugs must provide to medicare part d beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70%. under the inflation reduction act, the coverage gap phase and the associated coverage gap discount program will be eliminated after the 2024 plan year. starting in 2025, there will be a new part d manufacturer discount program, which requires a 10% discount in the initial phase and a 20% discount in the catastrophic phase of the benefit. the inflation reduction act also authorizes the government to negotiate maximum fair prices for certain medicare drugs. it also establishes mandatory rebates for part b and part d drugs with prices that increase faster than inflation. these new laws or any other similar laws introduced in the future may result in additional reductions in medicare and other health care funding, which could negatively affect our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in health care legislation and regulatory initiatives. for example, cms may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models.
adoption of new health care reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale. we cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any health care reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, including increased compliance requirements and costs, all of which may adversely affect our future business, operations, and financial results.
we have experienced challenges commercializing products outside of the u.s., and our future revenues will be dependent on our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products.
in most ex-u.s. markets, the pricing and reimbursement of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control and government authorities are making greater efforts to limit or regulate the price of drug products. the reimbursement process in ex-u.s. markets can take a significant time to conclude and reimbursement decisions are made on a country-by-country or region-by-region basis. further, many ex-u.s. governments are introducing new legislation focusing on cost containment measures in the pharmaceutical industry. the final form of these laws and the relevant practical application is unknown at this time, but may lead to lower prices, paybacks or other forms of discounts or special taxes.
our medicines treat life-threatening conditions and address relatively small patient populations, and our research and development programs are primarily focused on developing medicines to treat similar diseases. both government and private payors are targeting these types of high cost medicines, in some cases refusing to pay for them. we have experienced challenges in obtaining timely reimbursement for our products in various countries outside the u.s. for example, we obtained reimbursement for orkambi and symkevi in england in the fourth quarter of 2019, four years after orkambi's initial approval in 2015. our future product revenues, including from trikafta/kaftrio, depend on, among other things, our ability to maintain reimbursement in ex-u.s. markets for our products. there is no assurance that coverage and reimbursement will be available outside of the u.s. for our four approved medicines or any future medicine, and, even if it is available, whether the timing or the level of reimbursement will be sufficient to allow us to market our medicines. adverse pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement would decrease our future net product revenues and harm our business.
risks related to development and clinical testing of our products and product candidates our product candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval, and our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop additional product candidates for both cf and non-cf indications.
our business depends upon the successful development and commercialization of product candidates. these product candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. to satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our product candidates. discovery and development efforts for new pharmaceutical and biological products, including new combination therapies, are resource-intensive and may take 10 to 15 years or longer for each product candidate. it is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective and safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:
•offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive therapies;
•show the level of safety and efficacy, including the level of statistical significance, required by the fda or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug or biologic;
•be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or
•if approved for commercial sale, be successfully marketed as pharmaceutical or biological products.
we have recently completed and/or have ongoing or planned clinical trials for several of our product candidates. the strength of our product portfolio and pipeline will depend in large part upon the outcomes of these clinical trials, including those evaluating trikafta/kaftrio in younger children with cf, our cf pipeline products, exa-cel and vx-548 in pain. failure to advance product candidates through clinical development could impair our ability to ultimately commercialize products, which could materially harm our business and long-term prospects.
results of our clinical trials and findings from our nonclinical studies, including toxicology findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials, could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular product candidate or program. for example, in october 2020, we decided not to progress vx-814, a drug candidate for the treatment of aatd, into further development based on safety and pharmacokinetic data observed in a phase 2 clinical trial.
moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidate. furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or otherwise provide the level of evidence or safety and efficacy required by the fda or other regulatory authorities for approval of a product candidate. finally, clinical trials are expensive and require significant operational resources to implement and maintain.
many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials. for example, the results from completed preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of approval of a product candidate for commercial sale.
in addition, from time to time, we report interim, topline, and preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change. interim or preliminary data from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results from the clinical trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment and treatment continues and more patient data become available or as patients from our clinical trials continue other treatments for their disease. topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. as a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. if the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
the ability of third parties to review and/or analyze data from our clinical trials, including as a result of government disclosure, also may increase the risk of commercial confidentiality breaches and result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trial results. for example, clinical trial regulation (eu) no. 536/2014, and the ema policy on publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use, both permit the ema to publish clinical information submitted in marketing authorization applications. third party review and scrutiny could result in public misconceptions regarding our drugs and product candidates. these publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential, which could harm our business.
if we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining regulatory approval, we may incur additional costs, experience delays in commercialization, or be unable to commercialize our product candidates.
the time required to complete clinical trials and to satisfy the fda and other countries' regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years. our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. we also may encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in governmental policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and governmental regulatory review.
we may seek a fast track, priority review, breakthrough therapy, and/or rmat designation for some of our product candidates. product candidates that receive one or more of these designations may be eligible for, among other things, a priority regulatory review. each of these designations is within the discretion of the fda. accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for fast track, priority review, breakthrough therapy and/or rmat designation, the fda may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. the receipt of one or more of these designations for a product candidate does not guarantee a faster development process, review or approval compared to products developed or considered for approval under conventional fda procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the fda. in addition, even if one or more of our products or product candidates qualifies for fast track, priority review, breakthrough therapy and/or rmat designation, the fda may later decide to withdraw such designation if it determines that the product or product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification.
any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for a product candidate would prevent us from commercializing that product candidate. any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize a product candidate. furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations that we do not expect on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. any such limitations could reduce the size or demand of the market for the drug.
we also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. non-u.s. jurisdictions have different approval procedures than those required by the fda, and these jurisdictions may impose additional testing requirements for our product candidates. the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the u.s. and approval by a foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by the fda. in addition, although the fda may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the u.s., acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the fda. for example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. the trial population also must adequately represent the u.s. population, and the data must be applicable to the u.s. population and u.s. medical practice in ways that the fda deems clinically meaningful. in addition, while these clinical trials are subject to applicable local laws, fda acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable u.s. laws and regulations. if the fda does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the u.s., it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable product candidate.
if clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the product candidate could increase and the competitive position of the product candidate could be adversely affected.
we cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials. among the factors that could delay our development programs are:
•ongoing discussions with the fda or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials and the number of clinical trials we must conduct;
•failure or delay in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations ("cros") and clinical trial sites;
•failure to add or delay in adding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and obtaining institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval at each clinical trial site;
•suspension or termination of clinical trials of product candidates for various reasons, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements;
•clinical trial sites deviating from clinical trial protocol or dropping out of a clinical trial;
•delays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials, including as a result of low numbers of patients that meet the eligibility criteria for the trial;
•a lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers or patients in clinical trials;
•the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of unfavorable or inconclusive results, unforeseen complications in testing or clinical investigator error;
•inadequate supply or deficient quality of product candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;
•unfavorable fda or foreign regulatory authority inspection and review of a manufacturing facility that supplied clinical trial materials or its relevant manufacturing records or a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;
•serious and unexpected treatment-related side-effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by participants in clinical trials being conducted by our competitors to evaluate product candidates with similar mechanisms of action or structures to therapies that we are developing;
•favorable results in testing of our competitors' product candidates, or fda or foreign regulatory authority approval of our competitors' product candidates; or for planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. these milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. from time to time, we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. all of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. the actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in many cases for reasons beyond our control. if we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our estimates may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.
difficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates, and ultimately delay or prevent regulatory approval.
our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis is subject to a number of factors. clinical trials are expensive and require significant operational resources. delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times. the enrollment of patients further depends on many factors, including:
•the proximity of patients to clinical trial sites;
•the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, and the design of the clinical trial;
•our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;
•the number of other clinical trials ongoing and competing for patients in the same indication;
•reporting of the preliminary results of any of our clinical trials;
•the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease and eligibility criteria for the clinical trial;
•the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the clinical trials before clinical trial completion; and
•factors we may not be able to control, such as current or potential pandemics that may limit patients, principal investigators or staff or clinical site availability (e.g., the covid-19 pandemic).
we, our collaborators, the fda, or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time if we or they believe the healthy volunteers or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons. any such suspension could materially adversely affect the development of a particular product candidate and our business.
risks related to government regulation if regulatory authorities interpret any of our conduct, including our marketing practices, as being in violation of applicable health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
we are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the fca and the aks, and other similar laws and regulations both in the u.s. and in non-u.s. markets.
in the u.s., the federal anti-kickback statute prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the ordering, furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as medicare or medicaid. because of the broad scope of the prohibition, most financial interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, third party payors and patients would be subject to the statute. although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are narrow. financial interactions must therefore be structured carefully to qualify for protection or otherwise withstand scrutiny.
federal false claims laws, including the fca, prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved, known as "off-label" uses, that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for those off-label uses; submitting inflated "best price" information to the medicaid rebate program; and certain manufacturing-related violations. the scope of this and other laws may expand in ways that make compliance more difficult and expensive.
the fda and other regulatory agencies closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications other than those approved by the fda, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses. we market our products to eligible people with cf for whom the applicable product has been approved and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of each product in these patient populations. these eligible people do not represent all people with cf. if the fda determines that our promotional materials, training, or other activities constitute off-label promotion, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities, conduct corrective advertising, or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning or untitled letter, injunction, seizure, civil fines and criminal penalties. it also is possible that other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. even if it is later determined we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions, and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.
in the u.s., federal and state laws regulate financial interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers, require disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions, and mandate the adoption of compliance standards or programs. for example, the so-called federal "sunshine law" requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to cms payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals (and additional categories of health care practitioners beginning with reports submitted on or after january 1, 2022). we also have similar reporting obligations with respect to financial interactions throughout the e.u. we expended significant efforts to establish, and are continuing to devote significant resources to maintain and enhance, systems and processes to comply with these regulations. requirements to track and disclose financial interactions with health care providers and organizations increase government and public scrutiny of these financial interactions. failure to comply with the reporting requirements could result in significant civil monetary penalties.
the sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from government authorities in the u.s. and other countries in which we market our products, and we believe that this trend will continue. many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the government authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations. while we have a corporate compliance program which, together with our policies and procedures, is designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws and regulations, our business could be materially harmed. we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. even if we successfully defend against government challenge, responding to the challenge may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.
if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs in the u.s., we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
we participate in the medicaid drug rebate program, the 340b program, and a number of other federal and state government pricing programs in the u.s. to obtain coverage for our products by certain government health care programs. these programs require us to pay rebates or provide discounts to certain government payors or private purchasers in connection with our products when dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. in some cases, such as with the medicaid drug rebate program, the rebates are based on pricing and rebate calculations that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the government agencies that administer the programs. the terms, scope and complexity of these government pricing programs change frequently. for example, regulations finalized in december 2020 created an alternative medicaid rebate formula for "line extensions" of oral solid dosage forms. moreover, in december 2020, cms finalized changes to medicaid drug rebate program pricing calculations regarding the provision of co-payment assistance to patients that may be impacted by so-called accumulator programs operated by private insurers or pharmacy benefit managers. the portion of this rule dealing with manufacturer co-payment assistance was struck down by the u.s. district court for the district of columbia in may 2022 (and the deadline for an appeal has lapsed). consequently, while this rule has been vacated, it is possible that cms could issue new rulemaking or guidance on this topic that would affect rebates owed under the medicaid program or otherwise limit our ability to support our patient co-pay assistance program.
additionally, the expansion of the 340b drug discount program through the aca has increased the number of purchasers who are eligible for significant discounts on branded drugs. these and future changes to government pricing programs, laws, and regulations may have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operations.
we also may have reimbursement obligations or be subject to penalties if we fail to provide timely and accurate information to the government, pay the correct rebates, or offer the correct discounted pricing. changes to the price reporting or rebate requirements of these programs would affect our obligations to pay rebates or offer discounts. for example, the removal of the current statutory 100% of average manufacturer price per-unit cap on medicaid rebate liability for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, effective as of january 1, 2024, under the american rescue plan act of 2021 may affect the amount of rebates paid on prescription drugs under medicaid and the prices that are required to be charged to covered entities under the 340b drug discount program. additionally, the inflation reduction act requires manufacturers to pay rebates for medicare part b and part d drugs with prices that increase faster than the rate of inflation. responding to current and future changes to these and other medicaid drug rebate program requirements may reduce our net revenues and the complexity of compliance, will be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
if our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our product candidates.
we have a number of regulated processes and systems that are required both prior to and following approval of our drugs and product candidates. these processes and systems are subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. in addition, the clinical research organizations and other third parties that we work with in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials and our oversight of such parties are subject to similar reviews and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. if compliance issues are identified at any point in the development and approval process, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our product candidates, or delays in obtaining regulatory approval after filing, if at all. any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved drugs or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the fda and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we are party to agreements that transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting or compliance with manufacturing requirements, to our collaborators and third-party manufacturers. if our collaborators or third-party manufacturers do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which we or they obtain approval may be subject to later restrictions on manufacturing or sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we are subject to various and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal data, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business, result in fines and/or criminal penalties, and damage our reputation.
we are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that apply to the collection, storage, use, sharing, and security of personal data, including health information, and impose significant compliance obligations. in addition, numerous other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information. the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business.
for example, the e.u. general data protection regulation ("gdpr") went into effect in 2018 and has imposed new obligations on us with respect to our processing of personal data and the cross-border transfer of such data, including higher standards of obtaining consent, more robust transparency requirements, data breach notification requirements, requirements for contractual language with our data processors, and stronger individual data rights. different e.u. member states have interpreted the gdpr differently and many have imposed additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in the e.u. the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the e.u., including the u.s. and the u.k., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the gdpr. the gdpr rules related to cross border data transfers continue to evolve based on e.u. court decisions and regulator guidance, which presents certain practical challenges to compliance. regulators also continue to focus enforcement efforts on behavioral advertising and other online tracking technologies commonly used by companies. compliance with these evolving rules is challenging, as country specific guidance and rules are continually changing and limited alternatives currently exist in the market. compliance with the gdpr is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any activities falling within the scope of the gdpr.
in the u.s., california has passed the california consumer privacy act (the "ccpa"), which went into effect on january 1, 2020. in november 2020, california also passed the california privacy rights act (the "cpra"), which expands and builds upon the consumer privacy rights of the ccpa. the cpra came into effect january 1, 2023. certain other states have also enacted legislation governing the protection of personal data and several other states and the federal government are actively considering similar proposed legislation. additionally, brazil passed the general data protection law, which went into effect in august 2020. while we continue to address the implications of the new data privacy regulations, data privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges. each law is also subject to various interpretations by courts and regulatory agencies, creating even more uncertainty. while we have a global privacy program that addresses such laws and regulations, our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful.
we must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with the changing landscape in this area. failure to comply with data protection laws may expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities, private rights of action in some jurisdictions, and potential significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. failure to comply with the gdpr and applicable national data protection laws of european economic area member states could lead to fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual revenue of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. some of these laws and regulations also carry the possibility of criminal sanctions. for example, while we are not directly subject to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act ("hipaa"), we could be subject to penalties, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a hipaa-covered health care provider or research institution that has not complied with hipaa's requirements for disclosing such information. in addition, the commercialization of cell and gene therapies requires the collection and processing of a greater amount of personal data than traditional therapies, potentially increasing risk. furthermore, the number of government investigations related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase and government investigations typically require significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business and our reputation.
the covid-19 pandemic has added further complexity to the processing of personal data. for example, safety measures and government health regulations intended to protect our employees, contractors, and other visitors to our sites may require the collection of certain personal data. although we are focused on ensuring that personal data is properly protected, our efforts may be unsuccessful and we could unintentionally be subject to unauthorized access or disclosure of such personal data.
if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.
our research and development efforts involve the regulated use of hazardous materials, chemicals, and various controlled and radioactive compounds. although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of loss of, or accidental contamination or injury from, these materials cannot be eliminated. if an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. we also are subject to numerous environmental, health, and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, and the handling of biohazardous materials. although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. we maintain insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials that we believe is appropriate based on the small amount of hazardous materials we generate. additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. we may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.
risks related to business development activities our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to engage in transactions and collaborations with other entities that add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities.
to achieve our long-term business objectives, we seek to license or acquire products, product candidates and other technologies that have the potential to complement our ongoing research and development efforts, access emerging technologies and license or acquire pipeline assets. these transactions may be similar to prior transactions, may be structured differently than prior transactions, or may involve larger transactions or later-stage assets. we have faced and will continue to face significant competition for the acquisition of rights to these types of products, product candidates and other technologies from a variety of other companies, some of which have significantly more financial resources and experience in business development activities than we have. in addition, non-profit organizations may be willing to provide capital to the companies that control additional products, product candidates or technologies, which may provide incentives for companies to advance these products, product candidates or technologies independently. also, the cost of acquiring, in-licensing or otherwise obtaining rights to such products, product candidates or other technologies has grown dramatically in recent years and may be at levels that we cannot afford or that we believe are not justified by market potential. as a result, we may not be able to acquire, in-license or otherwise obtain rights to additional products, product candidates or other technologies on acceptable terms or at all.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies, and the integration following any such acquisition may disrupt our business and management.
effectively integrating acquired businesses, technologies and exclusive licenses is challenging. we may not realize the benefits anticipated from our external innovation transactions, such as our acquisitions of semma, exonics and viacyte and the exclusive licenses acquired from crispr and moderna. achieving the anticipated benefits of any transaction and successfully integrating acquired businesses or technologies involves a number of risks, including:
•failure to successfully develop and commercialize the acquired products, product candidates or technologies or to achieve other strategic objectives;
•delays or inability to progress preclinical programs into clinical development or unfavorable data from clinical trials evaluating the acquired or licensed product or product candidates;
•difficulty in integrating the products, product candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired asset or company;
•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from daily operations or other opportunities and challenges;
•the potential loss of key employees of an acquired company;
•entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed products, product candidate or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or challenges with respect to intellectual property, clinical or non-clinical data, safety, accounting practices, employee, or third-party relations and other known and unknown liabilities;
•liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;
•exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third parties; and
•difficulties in the integration of the acquired company's departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related procedures and policies.
acquisitions, licensing arrangements and other strategic transactions are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition, collaboration or strategic transaction or integrate an acquired or licensed asset, business or technology successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the strategic transaction.
we may later incur impairment charges related to assets acquired in any such transaction. even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with our strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income. future strategic transactions could result in increased operating expenses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, or impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, all of which could harm our financial condition.
we face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and product candidates.
the risks that we face in connection with our current collaborations, including crispr and entrada, and any future collaborations, include the following:
•our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources or expertise to effectively develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidates.
•the ability of some of our therapies to reach their potential could be limited if collaborators are unable to effectively develop, manufacture or commercialize these therapies or product candidates or decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization efforts related to those therapies or product candidates. our collaboration agreements allocate development, manufacturing and commercialization responsibilities between us and our collaborators and provide our collaborators with a level of discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.
•our collaborators may have limited experience in developing, manufacturing and commercializing therapies, either generally, or in the specific therapeutic area.
•collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties.
•collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the products or product candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us.
•disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities or costs for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration. any such disagreements would divert management attention and resources and would be time-consuming and expensive.
•collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation.
•collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability.
•investigations and/or compliance or enforcement actions against a collaborator, which may expose us to indirect liability as a result of our partnership with such collaborator.
•our collaboration agreements are subject to termination under various circumstances.
•we may be unable to control the resources our collaborators devote to our programs, products or product candidates, and the priorities and strategic objectives of our collaborators may not align precisely with ours.
additionally, if a collaborator were to be involved in a business combination with a third party, it might de-emphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us. if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.
we may not be able to attract collaborators or external funding for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates.
as part of our ongoing strategy, we may seek additional collaborative arrangements or external funding for certain of our development programs and/or seek to expand existing collaborations to cover additional commercialization and/or development activities. we have a number of research programs and clinical development programs, some of which are being developed in collaboration with a third party. at any time, we may determine that to continue development of a product candidate or program or successfully commercialize a drug we need to identify a collaborator or amend or expand an existing collaboration.
whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the fda, ema or other regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of the applicable intellectual property, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. potentially, and depending on the circumstances, we may desire that a collaborator either agree to fund portions of a drug development program led by us, or agree to provide all of the funding and directly lead the development and commercialization of a program. no assurance can be given that any efforts we make to seek additional collaborative arrangements will be successfully completed on a timely basis or at all. if we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. if we are unable to enter into acceptable collaborative relationships, one or more of our development programs could be delayed or terminated and the possibility of our receiving a return on our investment in the program could be impaired.
risks related to supply, manufacturing and reliance on third parties we depend on third-party manufacturers and our internal capabilities to manufacture our products and the materials we require for our clinical trials. we may not be able to maintain our third-party relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.
we rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers and our internal capabilities, including our own manufacturing facilities in boston, to manufacture product candidates for clinical trials as well as our medicines for commercial use. we could be subject to significant supply interruptions as a result of disruptions to third party or our internal manufacturing capabilities. our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution, including obtaining necessary supplies, is a multi-step international endeavor. third-party contract manufacturers, including some in china, perform different parts of our manufacturing process. contract manufacturers may supply us with raw materials, convert these raw materials into drug substance and/or convert the drug substance into final dosage form. third parties are used for packaging, warehousing and distribution of products. in cell and genetic therapies, third parties also will be used to both manufacture and deliver our therapies, which requires significant investment by us to secure capacity at third parties with expertise to meet our requirements. this capacity may be limited by the number of other clinical trials and commercial manufacturing ongoing for other companies seeking similar support.
if third parties are unwilling or unable to meet our requirements, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic or because of their own supply or capacity issues, we could experience supply disruptions outside of our control. additionally, manufacturing facilities, both foreign and domestic, are subject to inspections by the fda and other u.s. and foreign government authorities. although we actively engage with regulatory authorities, the timing of regulatory approvals for each of these facilities may be delayed for a variety of reasons, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, we and the third parties with whom we engage are required to maintain compliance with quality regulations globally. an inability to maintain compliance with such regulations, including cgmp requirements, could cause significant disruptions to our business and operations.
additionally, establishing, managing and expanding our global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of our numerous third-party contractual relationships. although we attempt to manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we could be subject to supply disruptions outside of our control. in addition, we may not be able to agree on contractual terms with third parties as needed for manufacturing of our products.
supply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays, general global supply chain disruptions, or any other performance failure by us or any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. we may also experience supply disruptions if regulatory agencies are unable to inspect the manufacturing facilities on which we rely. any such disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing or advancement of our clinical trials.
while we have developed internal capabilities to supply product candidates for use in our clinical trials as well as our medicines for commercial sale, a majority of the manufacturing steps needed to produce our medicines, product candidates, and drug products are performed through a third-party manufacturing network. we expect that we will continue to rely on third parties to meet our commercial supply needs and a significant portion of our clinical supply needs for the foreseeable future.
if we or our third-party manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing product and we are not able to promptly identify another manufacturer, we could experience a disruption in the commercial supply of our then-marketed medicines, which would have a significant effect on patients, our business, and our product revenues. similarly, a disruption in the clinical supply of product candidates could delay the completion of clinical trials and affect timelines for regulatory filings. we have a limited number of critical steps in our manufacturing process that are single sourced, including for commercialized products. to ensure the stability of our supply chains, we continue to develop alternatives for our manufacturing processes. however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain additional manufacturers or capacity for all of our product candidates and products on a timely basis or at all.
in the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or product candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. this would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer to have our products or product candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.
we rely on third parties to conduct pre-clinical work, clinical trials and other activities, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements.
we rely on third parties such as cros to help manage certain pre-clinical work and our clinical trials and on medical institutions, clinical investigators, and clinical research organizations such as the therapeutic development network, which is primarily funded by the cystic fibrosis foundation, to assist in the design and review of, and to conduct our clinical trials, including enrolling qualified patients. in addition, we engage third party contractors to support numerous other research, commercial and administrative activities. our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. for example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the clinical trial. moreover, the fda requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good laboratory practices and good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. such standards, particularly with respect to newer cell and genetic therapies, will continue to evolve and subject us and third parties to new or changing requirements.
if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them. although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could engage to continue the activities, it may result in a delay of the affected clinical trial, drug development program or applicable activity. if clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities might significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of these clinical trials or in specific circumstances might result in a requirement that a clinical trial be redone. accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our product candidates could be delayed. in addition, failure of any third-party contractor to conduct activities in accordance with our expectations, including as a result of covid-19, could adversely affect the relevant research, development, commercial or administrative activity.
risks related to intellectual property if our patents do not protect our products or our products infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation which could result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products or substantial liabilities.
we own and/or control numerous issued patents and pending patent applications in the u.s., as well as counterparts in other countries. our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and defend u.s. and foreign patents covering our products, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. we cannot be certain that any patents will issue from our pending patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with adequate protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable.
due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity, and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical and biotechnological inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents in the u.s. the leahy-smith america invents act (the "leahy-smith act"), made a number of significant changes to u.s. patent law in 2011. these include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. for example, the first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor who is the first to invent an invention but is not the first to file an application claiming that invention. u.s. and foreign patent applications typically are maintained in confidence for a period of time after they initially are filed with the applicable patent office. consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications on, our products or product candidates or their use. if a third party also has filed a u.s. patent application relating to our products or product candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may have to participate in legal or administrative proceedings to determine priority of invention. for applications governed by the leahy-smith act, if a third-party has an earlier filed u.s. patent application relating to our products or product candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may be unable to obtain an issued patent from our application.
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability. our patents may be challenged by third parties and certain of our patents have been challenged. this could result in the patent being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or the third party may circumvent any such issued patents. also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents.
our patents or patents we license might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from developing competing products. for instance, issued patents, or patents that may issue in the future, (i) relating to our small molecules may be limited to a particular molecule or molecules and may not cover similar molecules that have similar clinical properties, and (ii) relating to cell or genetic therapies may not cover similar technologies that would allow competitors to achieve similar results. consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. in addition, crispr only has co-exclusive rights to the patent rights that protect the core crispr/cas9 gene-editing technology.
the laws of many foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the u.s. and many companies in our segment of the pharmaceutical industry have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. if we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business could be substantially harmed.
because of the extensive time required for the discovery, development, testing and regulatory review of product candidates, it is possible that a patent may expire before a product candidate can be commercialized, or a patent may expire or remain in effect for only a short period following commercialization of such product candidate. this would result in a minimal or non-existent period of patent exclusivity. if our product candidates are not commercialized significantly ahead of the expiration date of any applicable patent, or if we have no patent protection on such product candidates, then, to the extent available we would rely on other forms of exclusivity, such as data exclusivity or orphan drug exclusivity.
uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes that are inherently costly and unpredictable.
there is considerable uncertainty within our industry about the validity, scope, and enforceability of many issued patents in the u.s. and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, the law and practice remains in substantial flux both in the agencies that grant patents and in the courts. we cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted as being infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.
there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. litigation, arbitrations, administrative proceedings, and other legal actions with private parties and governmental authorities concerning patents and other intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive, and distracting to management. competitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our products or to remove our products from the market. any litigation, including litigation related to abbreviated new drug applications ("anda"), litigation related to 505(b)(2) applications, interference proceedings to determine priority of inventions, derivations proceedings, inter partes review, oppositions to patents in foreign countries, litigation against our collaborators or similar actions, may be costly and time consuming and could harm our business. we expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our consolidated financial statements.
on july 24, 2020, we filed a lawsuit against sun pharmaceutical industries limited ("sun") in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware alleging infringement of u.s. patent no. 10,646,481 (the "'481 patent"). the lawsuit follows our receipt of a notice letter on june 11, 2020, advising that sun had submitted an anda to the fda seeking approval to manufacture and market a generic version of the 150 mg tablet of kalydeco® in the u.s. the notice letter indicated that sun submitted a "paragraph iv" certification to the fda in which sun asserts that the '481 patent is invalid or would not be infringed by sun's generic product. the '481 patent, which expires on august 13, 2029, was issued on may 12, 2020, and listed in the orange book with respect to kalydeco® tablets on june 1, 2020. sun does not appear to challenge our other u.s. patents covering kalydeco tablets, the latest of which expires on august 5, 2027.
on july 13, 2021, we filed a lawsuit against lupin limited and lupin pharmaceuticals, inc. (collectively, "lupin") in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware alleging infringement of the '481 patent. the lawsuit follows our receipt of a notice letter on june 2, 2021 advising that lupin had submitted an anda to the fda seeking approval to manufacture and market a generic version of the 150 mg tablet of kalydeco in the u.s. the notice letter indicated that lupin submitted a "paragraph iv" certification to the fda in which lupin asserts that the '481 patent is invalid or would not be infringed by lupin's generic product. lupin does not appear to challenge our other u.s. patents covering kalydeco tablet.
on june 2, 2022, we filed a lawsuit against aurobindo pharma limited ("aurobindo"), in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware alleging infringement of the '481 patent. the lawsuit follows our receipt of a notice letter on april 21, 2022, advising that aurobindo had submitted an anda to the fda seeking approval to manufacture and market a generic version of the 150 mg tablet of kalydeco in the u.s. the notice letter indicated that aurobindo submitted a "paragraph iv" certification to the fda in which aurobindo asserts that the '481 patent is invalid or would not be infringed by aurobindo's generic product. aurobindo does not appear to challenge our other u.s. patents covering kalydeco® tablet. the lawsuits against sun, lupin, and aurobindo described above regarding the 150mg tablet of kalydeco and the '481 patent have been consolidated by the delaware court. a scheduling order has been entered by the court and trial is set for february 2024. we intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to kalydeco tablet and the '481 patent.
on july 22, 2022, we filed a lawsuit against lupin in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware alleging the infringement of the '481 patent and the u.s. patent nos. 8,883,206 (the "'206 patent"), 10,272,046 (the "'046 patent"), and 11,147,770 (the "'770 patent"). the lawsuit follows our receipt of a notice letter on june 9, 2022, advising that lupin had submitted an anda to the fda seeking approval to manufacture and market a generic version of kalydeco® granules in the u.s. the notice letter indicated that lupin submitted a "paragraph iv" certification to the fda in which lupin asserts that the '481 patent, the '206 patent, and the '046 patent are invalid or would not be infringed by lupin's generic product. other than the '770 patent, which was listed in the orange book on april 14, 2022, lupin does not appear to challenge our other u.s. patents covering kalydeco granules, the last of which expires on august 5, 2027. a scheduling order has been entered by the court and trial is set for september 2024. we intend to vigorously enforce its intellectual property rights relating to kalydeco granules and the '481, '206, '046 and '770 patents.
crispr has licensed certain rights to a worldwide patent portfolio that covers various aspects of the crispr/cas9 editing platform technology including, for example, compositions of matter and methods of use in targeting or cutting dna from dr. emmanuelle charpentier, one of the named inventors of this patent portfolio. the patent portfolio also has named inventors who assigned their rights to the cvc group. for example, in connection with their collaboration, novartis and intellia therapeutics, inc. have reportedly obtained a license to this patent portfolio in certain fields. both the cvc group and the broad institute have obtained granted patents that purport to cover aspects of crispr/cas9 editing platform technology. patents and patent applications in this patent portfolio have been the subject of numerous contentious proceedings in the u.s., europe, and other jurisdictions, including interference proceedings in the uspto between the cvc group and (separately) the broad institute, sigma-aldrich and toolgen. on february 28, 2021, the uspto issued a decision in interference no. 106, 115, concluding that the broad institute invented certain applications of crispr/cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells before the cvc group. the cvc group has appealed the decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit. if the decision is upheld on appeal (including a potential subsequent appeal to the supreme court), the broad institute would maintain its granted patents directed to those applications crispr/cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells, and the cvc group's pending patent applications directed to that subject matter would not proceed to grant. we can give no assurances to the ultimate outcome of these proceedings or the disputes between the cvc group and the broad institute, sigma-aldrich and toolgen.
in addition to the broad institute, other third parties have filed patent applications claiming crispr/cas9-related inventions and may allege that they invented one or more of the inventions claimed by the cvc group. thus, the uspto may, in the future, declare an interference between certain cvc group patent applications and one or more patent applications. the broad institute, as well as other third parties, could seek to assert its issued patents against us based on our crispr/cas9-based activities, including commercialization. defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, could involve substantial litigation expense and could result in a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business. in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. in that event, we could be unable to further develop and commercialize exa-cel or other products that we may develop using the crispr/cas9 technology we license from crispr.
to the extent that valid present or future third-party patents or other intellectual property rights cover our products, product candidates or technologies, we or our strategic collaborators may seek licenses or other agreements from the holders of such rights to avoid or settle legal claims. such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, which may hinder our ability to, or prevent us from being able to, manufacture and market our products. payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products.
we may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.
many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.
in addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.
if we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.
risks related to our operations a variety of risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.
we have expanded our international operations over the past several years to market our cf medicines and expand our research and development capabilities. new laws and industry codes in the e.u. and elsewhere have expanded transparency requirements regarding payments and transfers of value to healthcare professionals, requirements surrounding patient-level clinical trial data, the protection of personal data and increased sanctions for violations. collectively, our expansion and these new requirements are adding to our compliance costs and potentially exposes us to sanctions in the event of an infringement or failure to report in these jurisdictions. in addition, a significant portion of our commercial supply chain, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, is located in china and the e.u. consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, including risks relating to intellectual property protections and business interruptions, including as a result of covid-19. these risks are increased with respect to countries such as china that have substantially different local laws and business practices and weaker protections for intellectual property. risks associated with operating a global biotechnology company include:
•differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;
•differing patient treatment infrastructures, particularly since our business is focused on the treatment of serious diseases that affect relatively smaller numbers of patients and are typically prescribed by specialist physicians;
•collectability of accounts receivable;
•changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements, the risks of which appear to have increased in the current political environment;
•economic weakness, including recession and inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;
•differing levels of enforcement and/or recognition of contractual and intellectual property rights;
•complying with local laws and regulations, which can change significantly over time;
•foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;
•foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in reduced revenues or increased operating expenses, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;
•workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the u.s.;
•global or regional public health emergencies that could affect our operations or business;
•production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and
•business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.
our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways.
in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law. for example, the fcpa prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. in many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the fcpa. we also are subject to import/export control laws. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and corresponding bad publicity and negative perception of our company in foreign countries.
if we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, our business could be materially harmed.
due to the highly technical nature of our drug discovery and development activities, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities. in addition, we need to attract and retain employees with experience in development, marketing and commercialization of medicines and therapies, including cell and genetic therapies. we have entered into employment agreements with some executives and provide stock-related compensation benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us. however, the employment agreements can be terminated by the executive on relatively short notice. the value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time can be significantly affected by movements in our stock price and business performance, and may, at any point in time, be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. we face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry, especially with respect to employees with expertise in cell or genetic therapies. we also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. moreover, the growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the boston area has increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields. the high cost of living can make it difficult to attract employees to our global headquarters in boston and our international headquarters in london. current job market dynamics, caused in part by the effects of covid-19 and other macro-level events, with many employers unable to fill existing openings at all levels of their organizations, could result in significant increases to our costs to recruit and retain employees. challenges could adversely affect our operations and financial results if we do not have sufficient staff to perform necessary functions. in addition, the available pool of skilled employees would be further reduced if immigration laws change in a manner that increases restrictions on immigration. our ability to continue to commercialize our products and achieve our research and development objectives depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands. if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
a breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.
we maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. in the course of our business, we collect, store, and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. a disruption, infiltration, or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to both private and governmental causes of action. while we have implemented security measures to minimize these risks to our data and information technology systems and have adopted a business continuity plan to deal with a disruption to our information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information systems will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business. in addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other related liabilities.
cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. they are often carried out by well-resourced and skilled parties, including nation states, organized crime groups, "hacktivists" and employees or contractors acting carelessly or with malicious intent. cyber-attacks include deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, malicious websites, the use of social engineering, and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data. cyber-attacks also include manufacturing, hardware or software supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of products or products produced for contract manufacturing or lead to a data privacy or security breach. our key business partners face similar risks, and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security. in addition, our increased use of cloud technologies heightens these third party and other operational risks, and any failure by cloud or other technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption, or loss of confidential or propriety information. risk of cyber-attack is increased with employees working remotely. remote work increases the risk we may be vulnerable to cybersecurity-related events such as phishing attacks and other security threats.
we are subject to risks associated with covid-19.
the covid-19 pandemic resulted in global economic downturns, significant travel and work restrictions in many regions and put a significant strain on healthcare resources, among other impacts. recovery from the economic and social disruptions of covid-19 have been uneven. we are unable to predict the extent and timing of any improvement in overall conditions. covid-19 may continue to impact our operations, the operations of our collaborators, third-party contractors and other entities, including governments, governmental agencies, and payors, and on the people with cf who take our medicines. in addition, we have seen some delays in enrollment in certain clinical trials, supply chain delays, and regulatory delays due to covid-19.
we monitor local covid-19 trends and government guidance for each of our site locations and utilize a site-specific approach to assess and permit employee access to our sites. there can be no assurance, however, that our sites will remain open, or whether we will be required to pause or delay enrollment and dosing at clinical trial sites. any site closure, pause, or delay of a clinical trial could harm our operations and delay the development of our product candidates. in addition, even if sites or clinical trials are open for enrollment, covid-19 may nevertheless impact clinical trial enrollment or participation, for example, due to suspension of in-person procedures required for enrollment, government shut-down orders, or decreased patient willingness to participate. covid-19 may also impact uptake of our medicines generally and patient retention in clinical trials, potentially resulting in higher drop-out rates or missed visits, which may negatively affect the strength of our clinical trial data.
health regulatory agencies globally may continue to experience disruptions in their operations as a result of covid-19
or future public health emergencies. the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies may have slower response times or lack resources to continue to monitor our clinical trials or to engage in other activities related to review of regulatory submissions in drug development. in response to the covid-19 pandemic and the public health emergency declaration in the u.s., on march 10, 2020, the fda announced its intention to temporarily postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products, and it subsequently postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities and provided guidance regarding the conduct of clinical trials. in july 2021, the fda stated that it had begun transitioning back to standard operations for domestic inspections, while continuing to prioritize mission-critical work for foreign inspections. in february 2022, the fda announced it was resuming standard operation for all domestic inspections. by the end of 2022, the fda had also resumed standard foreign inspections in most countries, though the frequency of foreign inspections had not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. the fda may not be able to maintain its current pace and further delays or setbacks are possible in the future. as a result, review, inspection, and other timelines for our product candidates may be materially delayed for an unknown period of time.
in the future, the economic impacts of covid-19 could affect our business. while the ultimate impact of covid-19 on our business is uncertain, a continued economic downturn could adversely affect our business directly or indirectly. it could affect the net prices for our products through changes in our payor mix as a result of increased unemployment in the u.s. or increased pressure on healthcare costs in the u.s. and around the world. any negative impacts of covid-19, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate other risk factors discussed herein. the full extent to which covid-19 will negatively affect our operations, financial performance, and stock price will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
if we fail to manage our operations effectively, our business may suffer.
we have expanded and are continuing to expand our global operations and capabilities, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure. to effectively manage our business, we need to:
•implement and clearly communicate our corporate-wide strategies;
•enhance our operational and financial infrastructure, including our controls over records and information;
•enhance our operational, financial and management processes, including our cross-functional decision-making processes and our budget prioritization systems;
•enhance our compliance and legal resources.
our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims and other litigation liability.
we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings, including securities/shareholder matters and claims related to product liability, intellectual property, employment law, data privacy, and breach of contract. such proceedings may involve claims for, or the possibility of, damages or fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties. if any of these legal proceedings were to result in an adverse outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
with respect to product liability and clinical trial risks, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions, alleging that our products or product candidates have caused, or could cause, serious adverse events or other injury. we have product liability insurance and clinical trial insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to cover this risk. however, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. if a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as pay uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us and these damages could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity is likely to result.
if our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed.
most of our operations, including our research and development activities, are conducted in a limited number of facilities. if any of our major facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, due to an earthquake, severe storms, fire or similar event, our operations could be seriously harmed. for example, our corporate headquarters, as well as additional leased space that we use for certain logistical and laboratory operations and manufacturing, are located in a flood zone along the massachusetts coast. we have adopted a business continuity plan to address most crises. however, if we are unable to fully implement our business continuity plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data and/or an inability to perform vital corporate functions, which could result in a significant disruption in our research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities, large expenses to repair or replace the facility and/or the loss of critical data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
the use of social media platforms presents risks and challenges.
social media is being used by third parties to communicate about our products and product candidates and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. we believe that members of the cf community may be more active on social media as compared to other patient populations due to the demographics of this patient population. social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. for example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a product or a product candidate, which could result in reporting obligations. in addition, our employees may engage on social media in ways that may not comply with legal or regulatory requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets and other intellectual property, or result in public disclosure of protected personal information. there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. certain data protection regulations, such as the gdpr, apply to personal data contained on social media. if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face regulatory actions or incur harm to our business, including damage to our reputation.
risks related to financial results and holding our common stock our stock price may fluctuate.
market prices for securities of companies such as ours are highly volatile. from january 1, 2022 to december 31, 2022, our common stock traded between $214.66 and $324.75 per share. the market for our stock, like that of other companies in the biotechnology industry, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. the future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:
•the information contained in our quarterly earnings releases, including updates regarding our commercialized products or our product candidates, our net product revenues and operating expenses for completed periods and financial guidance regarding future periods;
•announcements of fda actions with respect to our therapies or those of our competitors, or regulatory filings for our therapies or those of our competitors, or announcements of interim or final results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies relating to our therapies or those of our competitors;
•developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example, relating to drug pricing and tax reform;
•technological innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors;
•public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or our competitors;
•developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters;
•information disclosed by third parties regarding our business or products;
•developments relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks or stocks in general;
•business development, capital structuring or financing activities; and
•general worldwide or national economic, political and capital market conditions, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, inflation and rapid fluctuations in interest rates.
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholder derivative lawsuits and securities class action litigation are common. such litigation, if instituted against us or our officers and directors, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.
our effective tax rate fluctuates, and changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties, unfavorable resolution to the tax positions we have taken or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our future taxable income.
our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate globally. our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, tax authority examinations/audits of our tax filings, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes, and changes in tax laws or modifications of treaties in various jurisdictions. any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate that is significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.
on december 12, 2022, e.u. member states reached an agreement to implement the minimum tax component ("pillar two") of the organization for economic co-operation and development's (the "oecd's"), global international tax reform initiative. it is expected that e.u. member states will implement pillar two for tax years beginning after december 31, 2023. in addition, the u.k. has independently released draft legislation to introduce the oecd's pillar two reforms into u.k. law. if implemented, pillar two could result in changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we do business and adversely affect our provision for income taxes and our current rate.
we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and local tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. we regularly assess the probable outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, and we have established contingency reserves for material tax exposures. however, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation.
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. our revenues are primarily dependent on the amount of net product revenues from sales of our cf medicines. our total net product revenues could vary on a quarterly basis based on, among other factors, the timing of orders from our significant customers. additional factors that have caused quarterly fluctuations to our operating results in recent years include variable amounts of revenues, expenses resulting from our significant investments in research and development and commercialization activities, changes in the fair value of our strategic investments, derivative instruments and contingent consideration liabilities, charges for excess and obsolete inventories, interest income, interest expenses and our provision for income taxes. our revenues also are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business may affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. our quarterly results also could be materially affected by significant charges, which may or may not be similar to charges we have experienced in the past. most of our operating expenses relate to our research and development activities, do not vary directly with the amount of revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term. as a result, if revenues in a particular quarter are below expectations, we are unlikely to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter. these examples are only illustrative and other risks, including those discussed in these "risk factors," could also cause fluctuations in our reported financial results. our operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the results of future periods.
we expect that results from our clinical development activities and the clinical development activities of our competitors will continue to be released periodically, and may result in significant volatility in the price of our common stock.
any new information regarding our products and product candidates or competitive products or potentially competitive product candidates can substantially affect investors' perceptions regarding our future prospects. we, our collaborators, and our competitors periodically provide updates regarding drug development programs, typically through press releases, conference calls and presentations at medical conferences. these periodic updates often include interim or final results from clinical trials conducted by us or our competitors and/or information about our or our competitors' expectations regarding regulatory filings and submissions as well as future clinical development of our products or product candidates, competitive products or potentially competitive product candidates. the timing of the release of information by us regarding our drug development programs is often beyond our control and is influenced by the timing of receipt of data from our clinical trials and by the general preference among pharmaceutical companies to disclose clinical data during medical conferences. in addition, the information disclosed about our clinical trials, or our competitors' clinical trials, may be based on interim rather than final data that may involve interpretation difficulties and may in any event not accurately predict final results. the release of such information may result in volatility in the price of our common stock.
general risk factors we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available.
we may need to raise additional capital in the future. any potential public offering, private placement or debt financing may or may not be similar to the transactions that we entered into in the past. any debt financing may be on terms that, among other things, include conversion features that could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders and restrict our ability to pay interest and dividends-although we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. any equity financings would result in dilution to our then-existing security holders. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, incur significant cash exit costs, or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or product candidates. based on many factors, including general economic conditions, additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
future indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, and the terms of our credit agreements impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks.
in july 2022, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $500.0 million revolving credit facility and terminated an existing $500.0 million credit agreement entered into in 2019. in september 2022, our $2.0 billion credit agreement that was entered into in 2020 expired in accordance with its terms. subject to certain conditions, our current credit agreement provides that we may request the borrowing capacity be increased by an additional $500.0 million for a total of $1.0 billion. if we borrow under our current credit agreement or any future credit agreements, such indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain financial covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant. further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, and enter into transactions with affiliates. as a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business. failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owed under the credit agreements and/or our finance leases and could have a material adverse effect on our business. additionally, our obligations under the credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.
issuances of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
as of december 31, 2022, we had 257.0 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. as of december 31, 2022, we also had 2.9 million unvested restricted stock units ("rsus"), 1.2 million unvested performance stock units ("psus"), and outstanding options to purchase 2.5 million shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $146.11 per share.
the majority of our unvested rsus are likely to vest based on our employees' continued employment. the number of psus that vest is dependent on a potential range of shares issuable pursuant to certain financial and non-financial milestones, and our employees' continued employment. outstanding vested options are likely to be exercised if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price. in the future, we expect to issue a limited number of additional options to our directors.
in addition, we may issue additional common stock or restricted securities in the future as part of financing activities or business development activities and any such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our then-existing shareholders. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. the issuance of restricted common stock or common stock upon exercise of any outstanding options would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline.
there can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of common stock or that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices.
in february 2023, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program (the "2023 share repurchase program") pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of our common stock. our stock repurchases will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that we may deem relevant. we can provide no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices, if at all.
we have adopted provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws and are subject to massachusetts corporate laws that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace members of our board or to effectuate certain types of business combinations involving vertex.
provisions of our articles of incorporation, by-laws and massachusetts state laws may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace members of our current board of directors and may discourage certain types of business combinations involving vertex. our by-laws grant the directors a right to adjourn any meetings of shareholders prior to the time the meeting has been convened. we may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. massachusetts state law also prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations with an interested stockholder unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner, and prohibits voting by any shareholder who acquires 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock without shareholder approval. as a result, shareholders or other parties may find it difficult to remove or replace our directors or to effectuate certain types of business combinations involving vertex.

item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2022 as compared to 2021 are discussed below. for a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2021 as compared to 2020, please refer to item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our 2021 annual report on form 10-k, except as set forth below.
overview we are a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. we have four approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis ("cf"), a life-threatening genetic disease, and we continue to focus on developing additional treatments for cf. beyond cf, we have a pipeline that includes mid- and late-stage clinical programs in sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, acute and neuropathic pain, apol1-mediated kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and earlier-stage programs in diseases such as muscular dystrophies.
our triple combination regimen, trikafta/kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), was approved in 2019 in the united states (the "u.s.") and in 2020 in the european union (the "e.u."). collectively, our four medicines are being used by the majority of the approximately 88,000 people with cf in north america, europe, and australia. we are evaluating our medicines in additional patient populations, including younger children, with the goal of having small molecule treatments for all people who have at least one mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ("cftr") gene that is response to our cftr modulators. we also are pursuing genetic therapies for people with cf who do not make cftr protein and, as a result, cannot benefit from our current cf medicines.
financial highlights revenues       in 2022, our net product revenues increased to $8.9 billion as compared to $7.6 billion in 2021, primarily due to the strong uptake of trikafta/kaftrio in multiple countries internationally and continued steady performance of trikafta in the u.s., following the june 2021 launch of trikafta for children with cf 6 through 11 years of age.
expenses       our total research and development ("r&amp;d"), acquired in-process research and development ("aipr&amp;d"), and selling, general and administrative ("sg&amp;a") expenses decreased to $3.6 billion as compared to $3.9 billion in 2021. the decrease was primarily due to decreased aipr&amp;d following a $900.0 million upfront payment we made in 2021 to crispr in connection with an amendment to our exa-cel collaboration, partially offset by increased spend to advance the progression of several product candidates into mid- to late-stage clinical development. cost of sales was 12% of our net product revenues in 2022 and 2021.
cash           our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased to $10.8 billion as of december 31, 2022 as compared to $7.5 billion as of december 31, 2021 primarily due to our net product revenues and operating cash flows, partially offset by income tax payments and our $315.0 million acquisition of viacyte.
business updates marketed products we expect to continue to grow our cf business by increasing the number of people with cf who are eligible and able to receive our medicines, including younger people, and providing improved treatment options for people who are already eligible for one of our medicines. recent and anticipated progress in activities supporting these efforts is included below:
•the european commission and the united kingdom's medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency ("mhra") granted marketing authorization for kaftrio for the treatment of children with cf 6 through 11 years of age who have at least one f508del mutation in the cftr gene.
•the u.s. food and drug administration (the "fda") approved the use of orkambi in children with cf 12 months to less than 24 months of age who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in the cftr gene.
•in the fourth quarter of 2022, we submitted global regulatory filings for trikafta/kaftrio in children with cf 2 to 5 years of age and for kalydeco in children with cf from 1 month to less than 4 months of age.
pipeline we continue to advance a pipeline of potentially transformative small molecule and cell and genetic therapies aimed at treating serious diseases. recent and anticipated progress in activities supporting these efforts is included below.
•we are conducting two phase 3 global, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials, skyline 102 and skyline 103, evaluating our new once-daily investigational triple combination of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor, formerly known as vx-121/tezacaftor/vx-561, in people with cf 12 years of age and older, and have completed enrollment in these trials. we expect to complete these clinical trials by the end of 2023. we also have initiated a clinical trial of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in children with cf 6 to 11 years of age, known as the ridgeline study.
•in collaboration with moderna, we are developing vx-522, an mrna therapeutic for the treatment of people with cf who do not produce any cftr protein. in december 2022, the fda cleared our investigational new drug application ("ind") for vx-522. we have initiated a single-ascending dose clinical trial for vx-522 in people with cf, which is active and enrolling patients. we expect to complete this single ascending dose clinical trial and initiate the multiple ascending dose clinical trial in 2023. the fda has granted fast track designation for vx-522.
•we are evaluating the use of a non-viral ex vivo crispr gene-editing therapy, exagamglogene autotemcel ("exa-cel"), formerly known as ctx001, for the treatment of sickle cell disease ("scd") and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia ("tdt").
•in the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed regulatory submissions to the european medicines agency ("ema") and the mhra for exa-cel for scd and tdt, and both the ema and the mhra have validated the marketing authorization application. exa-cel has been granted ema priority medicines ("prime") designation in the e.u. and orphan drug designation in the e.u. and the united kingdom (the "u.k.").
•in november 2022, we initiated the submission of a biologics licensing application ("bla") for exa-cel for scd and tdt for rolling review by the fda, and expect to complete the submission by the end of the first quarter of 2023. in the u.s., exa-cel has been granted fast track, regenerative medicine advanced therapy, rare pediatric disease, and orphan drug designations.
•we have discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of nav1.8, with the objective of creating a new class of pain medicines that provide effective non-opioid pain relief, without abuse potential. in march 2022, we announced positive phase 2 data for vx-548, a nav1.8 inhibitor, for treatment of acute pain. we have initiated two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials with a total of 2,000 patients with moderate to severe acute pain following bunionectomy or abdominoplasty surgery. the phase 3 program for vx-548 also includes a single-arm study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of vx-548 in multiple other types of moderate to severe pain. we expect to complete these phase 3 trials in late 2023 or early 2024.
•the fda granted vx-548 breakthrough therapy and fast track designations for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain.
•at the end of 2022, we initiated a phase 2 clinical trial evaluating vx-548 in diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain.
•inaxaplin, formerly known as vx-147, is our small molecule for the treatment of apol1-mediated kidney disease ("amkd"), including apol1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ("fsgs"). based on positive phase 2 data in fsgs, we initiated pivotal development of inaxaplin in a single phase 2/3 adaptive clinical trial in patients with amkd. we continue to enroll patients in this phase 2/3 clinical trial and we expect to complete the phase 2 dose-ranging portion of the trial in 2023.
•vx-880 is a stem cell-derived, allogeneic, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy, using standard immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells. a clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate vx-880 as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes ("t1d"), and proof-of-concept has been achieved. we have completed enrollment in part b of the phase 1/2 clinical trial and, after completion of part b, we expect to begin part c of the trial, with concurrent dosing, in 2023.
•we continue to advance additional programs in t1d, in which these same stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cells are encapsulated and implanted in an immunoprotective device or are modified to produce hypoimmune cells with the goal of eliminating the need for immunosuppression. in december 2022, our clinical trial application ("cta") in canada for vx-264, the cells and device program, was authorized and we plan to begin screening, enrollment and dosing in canada in the coming months. in the u.s., the ind is on hold.
•we are working to address the underlying genetic cause of alpha-1 antitrypsin ("aat") deficiency ("aatd"). we are developing novel small molecule correctors of z-aat protein folding, with the goal of enabling the secretion of functional aat into the blood and addressing both the lung and the liver aspects of aatd. we have initiated a phase 1 clinical trial for vx-634, which is the first in a series of next-wave investigational molecules with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties as compared to our previous aat correctors, allowing potential exploration of the full dose response.
•we initiated a second phase 2 clinical trial of vx-864, a first-generation aat corrector, to assess the impact of longer-term treatment on the liver, as well as the levels of functional aat in the plasma.
•we are investigating a novel approach to treating duchenne muscular dystrophy ("dmd"), which delivers crispr/cas9 gene-editing technology to muscle cells, with the goal of restoring near-full length dystrophin protein expression by targeting specific mutations in the dystrophin gene that cause the disease. we are conducting enabling studies for our first in vivo gene-editing therapy for dmd and we expect to submit an ind for this program in 2023.
investment in external innovation recent investments in external innovation are included below.
•we acquired from catalyst biosciences, inc. ("catalyst") a portfolio of protease medicines that target the complement system and related intellectual property.
•we acquired viacyte, inc. ("viacyte"), a biotechnology company focused on delivering novel stem cell-derived cell replacement therapies as a potential functional cure for t1d. a phase 1/2 clinical trial of vctx-211, a hypoimmune cell program that we are developing in partnership with crispr therapeutics ag ("crispr"), is active and enrolling patients.
•we established a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with entrada therapeutics, inc. ("entrada"), focused on discovering and developing intracellular endosomal escape vehicle ("eev") therapeutics for dm1 (the "entrada agreement").
our business environment our net product revenues come from the sale of our medicines for the treatment of cf. our cf strategy involves continuing to develop and obtain approval and reimbursement for treatment regimens that will provide benefits to all people with cf and increasing the number of people with cf eligible and able to receive our medicines, including through label expansions, expanded reimbursement, and the development of new medicines. we are advancing our pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of serious diseases outside of cf. our strategy is to combine transformative advances in the understanding of causal human biology and the science of therapeutics to discover and develop innovative medicines. this approach includes advancing multiple compounds from each program, spanning multiple modalities, into early clinical trials to obtain patient data that can inform selection of the most promising compounds for later-stage development, and to inform discovery and development of additional compounds. we aim to rapidly follow our first-in-class therapies that achieve proof-of-concept with potential best-in-class candidates to provide durable clinical and commercial success.
in pursuit of new product candidates and therapies in specialty markets, we invest in research and development. we believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in product development and may provide product candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. to supplement our internal research programs, we acquire technologies and programs and collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations, as needed, to advance research in our areas of therapeutic interest and to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy.
discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical or biological product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise. across the industry, most potential drug or biological products never progress into development, and most products that do advance into development never receive marketing approval. our investments in product candidates are subject to considerable risks. we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our product development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. this process can result in rapid changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors.
our business also requires ensuring appropriate manufacturing and reimbursement of our products. as we advance our product candidates through clinical development toward commercialization and market and sell our approved products, we build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources. we rely on a global network of third parties and our internal capabilities to manufacture and distribute our products for commercial sale and post-approval clinical trials and to manufacture and distribute our product candidates for clinical trials. in addition to establishing supply chains for each new approved product, we adapt our supply chain for existing products to include additional formulations or to increase scale of production for existing products as needed. the processes for cell and genetic therapies can be more complex than those required for small molecule drugs and require additional investments in different systems, equipment, facilities and expertise. we are focused on ensuring the stability of the supply chains for our current products, as well as for our pipeline programs.
sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. reimbursement for our products, including our potential pipeline therapies, cannot be assured and may take significant periods of time to obtain. we dedicate substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the u.s. and ex-u.s. markets.
in the u.s., we have worked successfully with third-party payors to promptly obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our cf medicines. we plan to continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states, to ensure that payors recognize the significant benefits that our medicines provide and provide patients with appropriate levels of access to our medicines now and in the future. we cannot, however, predict how recent changes in the law, including through the inflation reduction act of 2022, will affect our ability to negotiate successfully with third-party payors in the future. in ex-u.s. markets, we seek government reimbursement for our medicines on a country-by-country or region-by-region basis, as required. this is necessary for each new medicine, as well as for label expansions for our current medicines. we expect to continue to focus significant resources to obtain expanded reimbursement for our cf medicines and, ultimately, pipeline therapies, in u.s. and ex-u.s. markets.
strategic transactions acquisitions as part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire products, product candidates and other technologies and businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts.
in 2022, we acquired viacyte, a privately held biotechnology company with intellectual property, tools, technologies and assets with potential to accelerate development of our t1d programs, for $315.0 million; and acquired from catalyst a portfolio of protease medicines that target the complement system and related intellectual property (the "catalyst complement portfolio") for $60.0 million. we expect to continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions and may include larger transactions or later-stage assets.
our acquisition of viacyte was accounted for as a business combination. as of the acquisition date, the cash payment was allocated primarily to goodwill and the fair value of an in-process research and development asset. operating expenses incurred by viacyte after the acquisition date and specific expenses associated with the acquisition are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations.
our acquisition of the catalyst complement portfolio was accounted for as an asset acquisition because substantially all the fair value acquired was concentrated in in-process research and development assets, which did not constitute a business, and for which we determined there was no alternative future use. as a result, we recorded our $60.0 million upfront payment to aipr&d.
please refer to our critical accounting policies, "acquisitions," for further information regarding the significant judgments and estimates related to our acquisitions.
collaboration and in-licensing arrangements we enter into arrangements with third parties, including collaboration and licensing arrangements, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of products, product candidates, and other technologies that have the potential to complement our ongoing research and development efforts.
over the last several years, we entered into collaboration agreements with a number of companies, including arbor biotechnologies, inc., crispr, kymera therapeutics, inc., mammoth biosciences, inc., moderna, inc., obsidian therapeutics, inc., and verve therapeutics, inc. generally, when we in-license a technology or product candidate, we make upfront payments to the collaborator, assume the costs of the program and/or agree to make contingent payments, which could consist of milestone, royalty and option payments. most of these collaboration payments are expensed as aipr&d; however, depending on many factors, including the structure of the collaboration, the stage of development of the acquired technology, the significance of the in-licensed product candidate to the collaborator's operations and the other activities in which our collaborators are engaged, the accounting for these transactions can vary significantly. we expect to continue to identify and evaluate collaboration and licensing opportunities that may be similar to or different from the collaborations and licenses that we have engaged in previously.
in addition, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement (the "entrada agreement") with entrada focused on discovering and developing intracellular eev therapeutics for dm1. in february 2023, the entrada agreement closed upon, among other things, the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and the expiration of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act. upon closing, we made an upfront payment of approximately $224.0 million to entrada, and purchased approximately $26.0 million of entrada's common stock in connection with the entrada agreement. we will account for the entrada agreement in the first quarter of 2023.
joint development and commercialization agreement with crispr in 2017, we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement (the "original jdca") with crispr, pursuant to which we are developing and preparing to commercialize exa-cel for scd and tdt. the original jdca was entered into following our exercise of an option to co-develop and co-commercialize the hemoglobinopathies program that was contained in a collaboration agreement that we entered into with crispr in 2015.
in april 2021, we and crispr entered into an amendment and restatement of the original jdca (the "a&r jdca"). in june 2021, we made a $900.0 million upfront payment to crispr in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the a&r jdca. we concluded that we did not have any alternative future use for the acquired in-process research and development and recorded this upfront payment to aipr&d. under the terms of the a&r jdca, we are leading worldwide development, manufacturing, and commercialization of exa-cel. as of july 1, 2021, 60% of the net profits and net losses for exa-cel are allocated to us and 40% of the net profits and net losses for exa-cel are allocated to crispr, subject to certain adjustments. crispr may earn an additional one-time $200.0 million milestone payment upon regulatory approval of exa-cel. we concluded that the original jdca and the a&r jdca are cost-sharing arrangements, which result in the net impact of the arrangements, excluding amounts recorded to aipr&d, being recorded in "research and development expenses" in our consolidated statements of operations.
acquired in-process research and development in 2022 and 2021, our aipr&d included $115.5 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, related to upfront, contingent milestone, or other payments pursuant to our business development transactions, including the collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions described above.
out-license agreements we also have out-licensed internally developed programs to collaborators who are leading the development of these programs. pursuant to these out-licensing arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for the research, development, and commercialization costs associated with these programs, and we are entitled to receive contingent milestone and/or royalty payments. as a result, we do not expect to incur significant expenses in connection with these programs and have the potential for future collaborative and royalty revenues resulting from these programs. none of our out-license agreements had a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations during 2022 and 2021.
please refer to note b, "acquired in-process research and development and other arrangements," for further information regarding our in-license agreements and out-license agreements.
strategic investments in connection with our business development activities, we have periodically made equity investments in our collaborators. as of december 31, 2022, we held strategic equity investments in certain public and private companies, and we expect to make additional strategic equity investments in the future. while we invest the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in instruments that meet specific credit quality standards and limit our exposure to any one issue or type of instrument, our strategic investments are maintained and managed separately from our other cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. as discussed below in "other income (expense), net" in our results of operations, any changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values (including publicly traded securities) are recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.

** not meaningful product revenues, net in 2022, our net product revenues increased by $1.4 billion, or 18%, as compared to 2021 primarily due to the launches of trikafta/ kaftrio in multiple countries internationally and the continued performance of trikafta in the u.s., following the june 2021 launch of trikafta for children with cf 6 through 11 years of age. decreases in revenues for our products other than trikafta/kaftrio were primarily the result of patients switching from these medicines to trikafta/kaftrio.
our net product revenues from the u.s. and from ex-u.s. markets were as follows:
2022                                                            % change                          2021                   % change                          2020
we expect that our net product revenues will increase in 2023 as a result of the continued performance of trikafta/kaftrio, label expansions into younger age groups for our previously approved products, and expanded access to our medicines.

** not meaningful beginning in 2022, we separately classify upfront, contingent milestone, or other payments pursuant to our business development transactions, including collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions as "acquired in-process research and development expenses," in our consolidated statements of operations in cases where such acquired assets do not have an alternative future use. to conform prior periods to our current presentation, we have reclassified $1.1 billion and $184.6 million from "research and development expenses" to aipr&d for 2021 and 2020, respectively.
cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of third-party royalties payable on net sales of our products as well as the cost of producing inventories. pursuant to our agreement with the cystic fibrosis foundation, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of trikafta/kaftrio, symdeko/symkevi, kalydeco, and orkambi, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens, with royalties on sales of trikafta/kaftrio lower than for our other products. over the last several years, our cost of sales has been increasing due to increased net product revenues. our cost of sales as a percentage of our net product revenues was 12% in each of 2022 and 2021. in 2023, we expect our total cost of sales will increase due to expected increases in our net product revenues and our cost of sales as a percentage of our net product revenues will be similar to our cost of sales as a percentage of net product revenues in 2022 and 2021.

our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our products and product candidates. we do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual products or product candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs. we assign external costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research by individual program. our internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs. all research and development costs for our products and product candidates are expensed as incurred.
over the past three years, we have incurred $7.5 billion in total research and development and aipr&d expenses associated with product discovery and development. the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. in addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and the disease indication being targeted. the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities. data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. the duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our product candidates to market are not available.
any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our product candidates are highly subjective and subject to change. until we have data from phase 3 clinical trials, we cannot make a meaningful estimate regarding when, or if, a clinical development program will generate revenues and cash flows.

our development expenses increased by $488.1 million, or 34%, in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to increased costs to support clinical trials associated with our advancing pipeline programs, including our cf triple combination of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor, pain and t1d. we are investing in both our internal headcount, leveraging outsourced services, and investing in infrastructure to support these programs. we expect our development expenses to continue to increase in 2023 as a result of our advancing pipeline programs, including our pain and t1d programs. in 2022 and 2021, costs related to our cf programs represented the largest portion of our development costs.

selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily due to the continued investment to support the commercialization of our medicines and increased support for our pipeline product candidates. we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in 2023 as we progress our efforts in preparation for the commercialization of exa-cel.
contingent consideration the fair value of our contingent consideration decreased by $57.5 million in 2022, primarily as a result of a revision to the scope of certain gene-editing programs in the second quarter of 2022. the fair value of contingent consideration decreased by $3.1 million in 2021. in future periods, we expect the fair value of contingent consideration to increase or decrease based on, among other things, our estimates of the probability of achieving and the timing of these contingent development and regulatory milestone payments, as well as the time value of money and changes in market interest rates.
other non-operating income (expense), net interest income interest income increased to $144.6 million in 2022, as compared to $4.9 million in 2021, primarily due to increased market interest rates and increased cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities. our future interest income is dependent on the amount of, and prevailing market interest rates on, our outstanding cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities.
interest expense interest expense was $54.8 million in 2022 as compared to $61.5 million in 2021. the majority of our interest expense in these periods was related to imputed interest expense associated with our leased corporate headquarters in boston.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net was expense of $164.8 million in 2022 and income of $4.9 million in 2021. the vast majority of these amounts relate to net unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value and sales of certain of our strategic investments. as of december 31, 2022, the fair value of our investments in publicly traded companies was $116.8 million. to the extent that we continue to hold strategic investments in publicly traded companies, we will record other income (expense) related to these investments on a quarterly basis. we expect that due to the volatility of the stock price of biotechnology companies, our other income (expense), net will fluctuate in future periods based on increases or decreases in the fair value of our strategic investments.
income taxes our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations. the factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include changes in tax laws, variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions, the amount and characterization of our research and development expenses, the levels of certain deductions and credits, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, acquisitions and third-party collaboration and licensing transactions.
our provision for income taxes was $910.4 million for 2022 and $388.3 million for 2021. our effective tax rate of 21.5% for 2022 was higher than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to an increase in our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities associated with intercompany transfer pricing matters partially offset by excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, tax credits, and changes in our estimated prior-year tax liabilities.
our effective tax rate of 14.2% for 2021 was lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to discrete tax benefits of (i) $94.8 million associated with an increase in the u.k.'s corporate tax rate from 19% to 25%, which was enacted in june 2021 and will become effective in april 2023, and (ii) $44.1 million resulting from an r&d tax credit study that we completed in 2021.

2022                                                                       2021                              % change cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities           $10,778.5                      $7,524.9                43%
working capital:
total working capital                                      $10,492.7                      $7,418.6                41%
working capital as of december 31, 2022, total working capital was $10.5 billion, which represented an increase of $3.1 billion from $7.4 billion as of december 31, 2021. the increase in total working capital in 2022 was primarily related to $4.1 billion of cash provided by operations driven by increased product revenues, partially offset by our $295.9 million net payment to acquire viacyte and purchases of property and equipment.
operating activities                   $4,129.9                                    $2,643.5                       $3,253.5
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion in 2022 as compared to $2.6 billion in 2021 primarily due to a $979.9 million increase in net income resulting from increased product revenues, the $900.0 million upfront payment to crispr paid in 2021, and an increase in product revenue accruals, partially offset by higher income tax payments.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $321.1 million and $340.9 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. in 2022, our investing activities included a net payment of $295.9 million to acquire viacyte and $204.7 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by net sales and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $227.3 million. our investing activities in 2021 primarily related to purchases of property and equipment, and, to a lesser extent, purchases of notes receivable and strategic investments.
financing activities cash used in financing activities was $67.7 million and $1.5 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. in 2022, the largest portion of our financing activities were payments related to our employee stock benefit plans and payments on finance leases. in 2021, the largest portion of our financing activities was $1.4 billion of share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase programs.
sources and uses of liquidity as of december 31, 2022, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $10.8 billion, which represented an increase of $3.3 billion from $7.5 billion as of december 31, 2021. we intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity.
we expect that cash flows from our products together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amounts of future revenues generated by our products, and the potential introduction of one or more of our other product candidates to the market, the level of our business development activities and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs.
credit facilities & financing strategy we may borrow up to a total of $500.0 million pursuant to a revolving credit facility that we entered into in july 2022 and could repay and reborrow amounts under this revolving credit agreement without penalty. subject to certain conditions, we could request that the borrowing capacity be increased by an additional $500.0 million, for a total of $1.0 billion. negative covenants in our credit agreement could prohibit or limit our ability to access this source of liquidity. as of december 31, 2022, the facility was undrawn, and we were in compliance with these covenants.
we may also raise additional capital by borrowing under credit agreements, through public offerings or private placements of our securities, or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing. we will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
future capital requirements we have significant future capital requirements, including:
•expected operating expenses to conduct research and development activities, manufacture and commercialize our existing and future products, and to operate our organization.
•royalties we pay to the cystic fibrosis foundation on sales of our cf products.
in addition, we have significant potential future capital requirements including:
•we have entered into certain business development-related agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development, and commercialization efforts. certain of our transactions, including collaborations, licensing arrangements, and asset acquisitions, include the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets and/or commercial targets. our obligation to fund these research and development and commercialization efforts and to pay these potential milestone and royalties is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs associated with our collaborations, licensing arrangements and acquisitions. we may enter into additional business development transactions, including acquisitions, collaborations, licensing arrangements and equity investments, that require additional capital.
•to the extent we borrow amounts under our existing credit agreement, we would be required to repay any outstanding principal amounts in 2027.
•in february 2023, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of our common stock. the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and can be discontinued at any time.
additional information on several of our future capital requirements is provided below.
research and development costs at any point in time, we have several ongoing clinical trials at various stages of clinical development. our clinical trial costs are dependent on, among other things, our research activities advancing to later-stage clinical development as well as the size, number, and length of our clinical trials.
leases finance leases our corporate headquarters is in two buildings that we lease at fan pier in boston, massachusetts. we commenced lease payments on these buildings in 2013 and the initial lease periods end in december 2028. we also lease office and laboratory space in san diego, california. we commenced lease payments for this building in 2019 pursuant to an initial 16-year lease term. we account for each of these buildings as finance leases.
operating leases we account for our remaining real estate leases as operating leases, including office and laboratory space at the jeffrey leiden center for cell and genetic therapies near our corporate headquarters. base rent payments commenced in 2021 pursuant to an initial 15-year lease term for this building.
our total future minimum lease payments for our finance and operating leases for each of the next five years and in total are included in note m, "leases." the total future undiscounted minimum lease payments were $666.3 million and $491.3 million related to our finance and operating leases, respectively, as of december 31, 2022.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:
•revenue recognition;
our accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in note a, "nature of business and accounting policies."
revenue recognition product revenues, net we generate product revenues from sales in the u.s. and in international markets. we sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors in the u.s., which account for the largest portion of our total revenues. we make international sales primarily through distributor arrangements and to retail pharmacies or pharmacy chains, as well as to hospitals and clinics, many of which are government-owned or supported customers. our customers in the u.s. subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. we contract with government agencies so that our products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. we recognize net product revenues from sales of our products when our customers obtain control of our products, which typically occurs upon delivery to our customers. revenues from our product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price, which requires us to make several significant estimates regarding the net sales price.
the most significant estimate we are required to make is related to government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, collectively rebates. the values of the rebates provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors. to estimate our total rebates, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix. we track available information regarding changes, if any, to the payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel. we adjust our estimated rebates based upon new information as it becomes available, including information regarding actual rebates for our products. claims by third-party payors for rebates are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known. our credits to revenue related to prior period sales have not been significant (typically less than 1% of gross product revenues) and primarily related to u.s. rebates.
balance as of december 31, 2019                         $635.7
adjustments related to prior year(s) sales                 0.6
balance as of december 31, 2020                         $775.6
adjustments related to prior year(s) sales              (27.6)
balance as of december 31, 2021                         $838.6
adjustments related to prior year(s) sales              (10.4)
balance as of december 31, 2022                       $1,291.4
we have also entered into annual contracts with government-owned and supported customers in international markets that limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. upon exceeding the annual reimbursement amount, products are provided free of charge, which is a material right. we defer a portion of the consideration received, which includes upfront payments and fees, for shipments made up to the annual reimbursement limit as "other current liabilities." the deferred amount is recognized as revenue when the free products are shipped. to estimate the portion of the consideration received to be recognized as revenue and the portion of the amount to be deferred, we rely on our forecast of the number of units we will distribute during the applicable annual period in each international market in which our contracts with government-owned and supported customers limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. our forecasts are based on, among other things, our historical experience.
the preceding estimates and judgments materially affect our recognition of net product revenues. changes in our estimates of net product revenues could have a material effect on net product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.
acquisitions as part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire products, product candidates and other technologies and businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts. if we determine that substantially all the fair value that we acquire in an acquisition is concentrated in a single asset, and the acquisition does not constitute a business, we account for it as an asset acquisition. for an asset acquisition of intellectual property that has not yet achieved regulatory approval, we record our upfront payment to aipr&d, as long as we determine there is no alternative future use for the asset that was acquired.
if the fair value that we acquired in an acquisition is distributed among more than one asset, and the acquisition constitutes a business, we account for it as a business combination.
we are required to make several significant judgments and estimates to calculate the purchase price for our business combinations and then allocate it to the assets that we have acquired and the liabilities that we have assumed on our consolidated balance sheet. the most significant judgments and estimates relate to the fair value of the in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities related to these business combinations. based on these judgments and estimates, the fair value of the goodwill that we record as a result of these business combinations may be material. once recorded, these assets are subject to quarterly impairment analysis and our contingent consideration liabilities are adjusted quarterly, which requires similar judgments and estimates.
intangible assets in 2022, we recorded a $216.6 million in-process research and development intangible asset related to our acquisition of viacyte on our consolidated balance sheet. we also recorded a $13.0 million impairment of an in-process research and development intangible asset to "research and development expenses," due to a decision to revise the scope of certain acquired gene-editing programs. as of december 31, 2022, we had $603.6 million of in-process research and development assets on our consolidated balance sheet. each of these assets is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and reflected on our consolidated balance sheets until either the project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired. our in-process research and development intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. when we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project, we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs.
to determine the fair value of our in-process research and development assets, we have utilized either the multi-period excess earnings or the relief from royalty methods of the income approach. each method requires us to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success, revenue projections and growth rates, and appropriate discount and tax rates. the multi-period excess earnings method also requires us to estimate development and commercial costs. the relief from royalty method also requires us to estimate the after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the asset that we acquired.
contingent consideration as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $129.0 million and $186.5 million, respectively, of liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets attributable to the fair value of the contingent development and regulatory payments that we may owe to exonics' former equity holders upon the achievement of certain events. the decrease in fair value of contingent consideration during 2022 was primarily due to a revision to the scope of certain acquired gene-editing programs.
we record an increase or a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and in our consolidated statement of operations on a quarterly basis. we determine the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method of the income approach, which requires us to make estimates of the timing of regulatory and commercial milestone achievement and the corresponding estimated probability of technical and regulatory success rates. significant judgment is used in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions during each reporting period. reasonable changes in these assumptions can cause material changes to the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. due to the early stage of exonics' programs, these significant assumptions could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
goodwill as of december 31, 2022 and 2021, we had goodwill of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. in 2022, we recorded $85.8 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet related to our acquisition of viacyte. in 2021, we did not have any business combinations; therefore, we did not record any additional goodwill. goodwill reflects the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. thus, the goodwill that we record is dependent on the significant judgments and estimates inherent in the fair value of our in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities. we have one reporting unit for goodwill reporting purposes. we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. we have not identified any goodwill impairment to date.
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. if our estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is (i) not reflective of actual outcomes, (ii) modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, or (iii) revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal, our results of operations could be materially impacted.
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. on a periodic basis, we reassess our valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. significant judgment is required in making these assessments to maintain or reverse our valuation allowances and, to the extent our future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at that time. as of december 31, 2022, we maintained a valuation allowance of $237.8 million related primarily to u.s. state tax attributes.
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we adjust our liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the uncertain positions. we are subject to tax laws and audits in multiple jurisdictions and significant judgment is required in making this assessment. consequently, we regularly re-evaluate uncertain tax positions and consider various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. as of december 31, 2022, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $459.6 million.

item 1a.  risk factors you should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all of the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. if any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
competitive and business risks we operate in a competitive business environment and may not be able to compete effectively.
the markets for our products and services are highly competitive from new and existing competitors. our principal competitors include other vendors and providers of financial services technology and payment systems, data processing affiliates of large companies, processing centers owned or operated as user cooperatives, financial institutions, independent sales organizations ("isos"), independent software vendors, payments companies and payment network operators. our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. many of our larger existing and potential clients have historically developed their key applications in-house. as a result, we may compete against our existing or potential clients' in-house capabilities. in addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new technologies and well-funded competitors, including large technology, telecommunication, media and other companies not historically in the financial services and payments industries, start-ups and international providers of products and services similar to ours. in addition, participants in the financial services, payments and technology industries may merge, create joint ventures or engage in other business combinations, alliances and consolidations that may strengthen their existing products and services or create new products and services that compete with ours. we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us in the markets in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
if we fail to keep pace with technological change, we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients, and our ability to grow may be limited.
the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant and rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent introduction of new products and services, and increasing client expectations. our ability to respond timely to these changes, including by enhancing our current products and services and developing and introducing new products and services, will significantly affect our future success. in addition, the success of certain of our products and services rely, in part, on financial institutions, business partners and other third parties promoting the use of or distributing our products and services. if we are unsuccessful in developing, marketing and selling products or services that gain market acceptance, or if third parties insufficiently promote or distribute our products and services, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain existing clients, to attract new ones and to grow profitably.
if we are unable to renew contracts on favorable terms or if contracts are terminated prematurely, we could lose clients and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
failure to achieve favorable renewals of client contracts could negatively impact our business. at the end of the contract term, clients have the opportunity to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider whether to engage one or more of our competitors to provide products and services or to perform the services in-house. some of our competitors may offer more attractive prices, features or other services that we do not offer, and some clients may desire to perform the services themselves. larger clients may be able to seek lower prices from us when they renew or extend a contract or the client's business has significant volume changes. in addition, larger clients may reduce the services we provide if they decide to move services in-house. further, our small merchant business clients may seek reduced fees due to pricing competition, their own financial condition or pressure from their customers.
we also have contracts with u.s. federal, state and local governments. the contracts with these clients may contain terms that are not typical for non-government clients, such as the right to terminate for convenience, the right to unilaterally modify or reduce work to be provided under the contract, significant or unlimited indemnification obligations and being subject to appropriation of funds for the government contract program. in addition, if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, we could be suspended or debarred from contracting with that entity in the future, which could also provide other government clients the right to terminate.
these factors could result in lower revenue from a client than we had anticipated based on our agreement with that client. if we are not successful in achieving high contract renewal rates and favorable contract terms, if contracts are terminated, or if we are prevented from performing work for these clients in the future, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
our business depends, in part, on our merchant relationships and alliances, and if we are unable to maintain these relationships and alliances, our business may be adversely affected.
under our alliance program, a bank or other institution forms an alliance with us, generally on an exclusive basis, either contractually or through a separate legal entity. merchant contracts may be contributed to the alliance by us and/or the bank or institution. the banks and other institutions generally provide card association sponsorship, clearing and settlement services and typically act as a merchant referral source when the institution has an existing banking or other relationship with such merchant. we provide transaction processing and related functions to the alliance. both we and our alliance partners may also provide management, sales, marketing and other administrative services. the alliance structure allows us to be the processor for multiple financial institutions, any one of which may be selected by the merchant as its bank partner. our merchant acquiring business depends, in part, on our merchant relationships, alliances and other distribution channels. there can be no guarantee that we will achieve growth in our merchant relationships, alliances or other distribution channels. in addition, our contractual arrangements with merchants and merchant alliance partners are for fixed terms and may allow for early termination upon the occurrence of certain events. there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our contractual arrangements with these merchants or merchant alliance partners on similar terms or at all. the loss of merchant relationships or alliance partners could negatively impact our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
the ongoing covid-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on our business and may amplify many of our other known risks.
the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and the related government actions taken to prevent the spread of covid-19 have increased economic uncertainty and financial market volatility and caused a decline in consumer and business confidence, and could further negatively impact the demand for our products and services, including merchant acquiring and payment processing. ultimately, the extent of the adverse impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on, among other matters, the duration and intensity of the pandemic; the level of success of global vaccination efforts; governmental and private sector responses to the pandemic and the impact of such responses on us; and the impact of the pandemic on our employees, clients, vendors, supply chain, operations and sales, all of which are uncertain, difficult to predict and may remain prevalent for a significant period of time even after the pandemic subsides. these and other potential negative impacts relating to the covid-19 pandemic may also heighten or exacerbate the other risk factors described in this annual report on form 10-k.
changes in card association and debit network fees or products could increase costs or otherwise limit our operations.
from time to time, card associations and debit networks, including the card networks which we own and operate, increase the processing and other fees (including what is commonly called "interchange fees") that they charge. it is possible that competitive and other pressures will result in us absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, or not being able to increase our own fees, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our profit margin, limit our growth, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements. any increase in the capital level required would further limit our use of capital for other purposes.
consolidations in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our revenue by eliminating existing or potential clients and making us more dependent on fewer clients.
mergers, consolidations and failures of financial institutions reduce the number of our clients and potential clients, which could adversely affect our revenue. if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. our alliance strategy could also be negatively affected by consolidations, especially where the financial institutions involved are committed to their internal merchant processing businesses that compete with us. it is also possible that the larger financial institutions that result from mergers or consolidations could have an increased ability to negotiate terms with us or could decide to perform in-house some or all of the services which we currently provide or could provide. any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
operational and security risks security incidents or other technological risks involving our systems and data, or those of our clients, partners or vendors, could expose us to liability or damage our reputation.
our operations depend on receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, our employees, our clients and their customers. under the card network rules, various federal, state and international laws, and client contracts, we are responsible for information provided to us by financial institutions, merchants, isos, third-party service providers and others. preserving the confidentiality of sensitive business and personal information is critical to our business. any unauthorized access, intrusion, infiltration, network disruption, ransom, denial of service or similar incident could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or data, or the systems or data of our clients, partners or vendors. these incidents are often difficult to detect and are constantly evolving. we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, and those of our clients, partners and vendors, through various means and with increasing sophistication, particularly as cybercriminals attempt to profit from increased online banking, e-commerce and other online activity. these events could create costly litigation, significant financial liability, increased regulatory scrutiny, financial sanctions and a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients and cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. in addition, we expect to continue to invest significant resources to maintain and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and that none of the events that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, we cannot be certain that the security measures and procedures we have in place to detect security incidents and protect sensitive data, including protection against unauthorized access and use by our employees, will be successful or sufficient to counter all current and emerging risks and threats. the impact of a material event involving our systems and data, or those of our clients, partners or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
operational failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our products or services could harm our business and reputation.
our business depends heavily on the reliability of our systems. an operational failure that results in an interruption in the availability of our products and services could harm our business or cause us to lose clients. an operational failure could involve the hardware, software, data, networks or systems upon which we rely to deliver our services and could be caused by our actions, the actions of third parties or events over which we may have limited or no control. events that could cause operational failures include, but are not limited to, hardware and software defects or malfunctions, ransomware, denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, pandemics, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. in the event of operational failures or damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully or quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets and data through our business continuity program. implementation delays, interruptions of service or hardware device defects could damage our relationship with clients and could cause us to incur substantial expenses, including those related to the payment of service credits, product recalls or other liabilities. a prolonged interruption of our services or network could cause us to experience data loss or a reduction in revenue, and significantly impact our clients' businesses and the customers they serve. in addition, a significant interruption of service or product recall could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our current and potential clients to choose another service provider. as a provider of payments solutions and other financial services, clients, regulators and others may require enhanced business continuity and disaster recovery plans including frequent testing of such plans. meeting these various requirements may require a significant investment of time and money. any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
disruptions of operations of other participants in the global financial system could prevent us from delivering our products and services.
the operations and systems of many participants in the global financial system are interconnected. many of the transactions involving our products and services rely on multiple participants in the global financial system to move funds and communicate information to the next participant in the transaction chain. a disruption for any reason of the operations of a participant in the global financial system could impact our ability to obtain or provide information or cause funds to be moved in a manner to successfully deliver our products and services. although we work with other participants to avoid any disruptions, there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective. such a disruption could lead to our inability to deliver products and services, reputational damage, lost clients and revenue, loss of clients' and their customers' confidence, as well as additional costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we rely on third parties to provide products and services and if we are unable to obtain such products or services in the future or if these third parties fail to perform these services adequately, our business may be materially and adversely affected.
we rely on third parties we do not control to provide us with products and services, including payment card networks, acquiring processors, payment card issuers, financial institutions and the automated clearing house ("ach") network which transmit transaction data, process chargebacks and refunds, and perform clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. if, for example, such third parties stop providing clearing services or limit our volumes, we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services. in the event these third parties fail to provide these services adequately or in a timely manner, including as a result of errors in their systems or events beyond their control, or refuse to provide these services on terms acceptable to us or at all, and we are not able to find timely suitable alternatives, we may no longer be able to provide certain services to customers, which could expose us and our clients to information security, financial, compliance and reputational risks. we may be negatively impacted by a disruption to our supply chain or third-party delivery service providers, including if the factories that manufacture our point-of-sale devices, payment cards or computer chips for payment cards, or paper stock are temporarily closed or experience workforce shortages; shipping services are interrupted or delayed; there are increased lead times, shortages or higher costs for certain materials and components; or there are workforce shortages at our third-party customer support, software development or technology hosting facilities. if we are unable to renew our existing contracts with key vendors and service providers, we might not be able to replace the related product or service at all or at the same cost. any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we may experience software defects, development delays or installation difficulties, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability.
our services are based on sophisticated software and computer systems and we may encounter delays when developing new applications and services. further, the software underlying our services may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or when new versions are released. we may also experience difficulties in installing or integrating our technology on systems or with other programs used by our clients. defects in our software, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions or other difficulties could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients or client data, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims. although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions in our license and client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will successfully limit our liability.
global market risks our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical and other risks associated with operations outside of the u.s. and, as we continue to expand internationally, we may incur higher than anticipated costs and may become more susceptible to these risks.
we offer merchant acquiring, processing and issuing services outside of the u.s., including in the u.k., germany, mexico, uruguay, argentina, india and brazil. our facilities outside of the u.s., and those of our suppliers and vendors, including manufacturing, customer support, software development and technology hosting facilities, are subject to risks, including natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, terrorism, war (such as the war in ukraine), political instability and other events outside of our or our suppliers' control. as we continue to expand internationally and grow our client base outside of the u.s., we may face challenges due to the presence of more established competitors and our relative lack of experience in such non-u.s. markets, and we may incur higher than anticipated costs. if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with the international operation and expansion of our business, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.
our business has been and may continue to be adversely impacted by u.s. and global market and economic conditions.
for the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to derive revenue primarily from products and services we provide to the financial services industry and from our merchant acquiring business. given this focus, we are exposed to global economic conditions and adverse economic trends may accelerate the timing, or increase the impact of, risks to our financial performance. such trends may include, but are not limited to, the following:
•inflation, foreign currency fluctuations, declining economies, social unrest, natural disasters, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors, on which a significant portion of our revenues are dependent;
•low levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high inflation and/or unemployment, may cause decreased spending by cardholders;
•budgetary concerns in the u.s. and other countries around the world could affect the u.s. and other specific sovereign credit ratings, impact consumer confidence and spending, and increase the risks of operating in those countries;
•emerging market economies tend to be more volatile than the more established markets we serve in the u.s. and europe, and adverse economic trends, including high rates of inflation, may be more pronounced in such emerging markets;
•financial institutions may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate cardholder defaults;
•uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients' businesses may make estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives, and realization of prepaid assets less predictable;
•our clients may decrease spending for value-added services; and
•government intervention, including the effect of laws, regulations, treaties and/or government investments in our clients, may have potential negative effects on our business, operations and our relationships with our clients or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products.
a further weakening in the economy or competition from other retailers could also force some retailers to close, resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and declines in transactions, and reduced earnings on transactions due to a potential shift to large discount merchants. additionally, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices.
a prolonged poor economic environment, including a potential recession in the u.s. or other economies in which our business operates, could result in significant decreases in demand by current and potential clients for our products and services and in the number and dollar amount of transactions we process or accounts we service, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
in europe, we are continuing to assess the implications of the u.k. leaving the e.u. ("brexit"). we cannot predict the impact that brexit, including any future trade agreements, divergence in law or currency fluctuations, will have on our business and our clients, and it is possible that it may adversely affect our operations and financial results.
potential tariffs or trade wars could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products and our financial results.
the u.s. has imposed tariffs on certain imports from china, including on some of our hardware devices manufactured in china. if the u.s. administration imposes additional tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the u.s. or other countries, our hardware devices produced in china could be impacted. although it is difficult to predict how current or future tariffs on items imported from china or elsewhere will impact our business, the cost of our products manufactured in china and imported into the u.s. or other countries could increase, which in turn could adversely affect the demand for these products and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
regulatory and compliance risks if we or third parties with whom we partner or contract fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liability and our business could be harmed.
if we or third parties with whom we partner or contract fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business, including state and federal payment, cybersecurity, consumer protection, trade and data privacy laws and regulations, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory proceedings, our client relationships and reputation could be harmed, and our ability to obtain new clients could be inhibited, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our clients are also subject to numerous laws and regulations applicable to banks, financial institutions and card issuers in the u.s. and abroad, and, consequently, we are at times affected by these federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are subject to change, and new laws, regulations and interpretations are regularly adopted.
certain of our subsidiaries are licensed as money transmitters and are required, among other matters, to demonstrate and maintain certain levels of net worth and liquidity and to file periodic reports. our direct-to-consumer payments businesses are subject to state and federal regulations in the u.s., including state money transmission regulations, anti-money laundering regulations, economic and trade sanctions administered by the u.s. treasury department's office of foreign asset control ("ofac") and certain privacy regulations, such as the u.s. gramm-leach-bliley act. our money network financial, llc subsidiary must meet the requirements of the financial crimes enforcement network because it is the program manager for various prepaid card programs. we operate businesses that are subject to credit reporting and debt collection laws and regulations in the u.s. and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to privacy, anti-money laundering, debt collection, and payment institution or electronic money licensing regulations outside the u.s.
we operate our business around the world, including in certain foreign countries with developing economies where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws applicable to us, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act. these laws prohibit, among other things, improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. we also derive revenue from transactions involving sales to u.s. federal, state and local governments and their respective agencies, and are subject to various procurement laws, regulations, and contract provisions relating to those contracts. we have implemented policies and training programs to comply with applicable laws, regulations and obligations; however, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants and agents will comply with our policies and all applicable laws and any noncompliance could subject us to fines, penalties and loss of business.
we are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs, including those that are administered by ofac, which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries, their governments, individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists equivalent to ofac lists in several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process. our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations.
the volume and complexity of the regulations that impact our business, directly or indirectly, will continue to increase our cost of doing business. failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes in the regulatory environment, including changing interpretations and the implementation of new, varying or more restrictive laws and regulations by federal, state, local or foreign governments, may result in significant financial penalties, reputational harm, suspension or termination of our ability to provide certain services, or change or restrict the manner in which we currently conduct our business, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the payment card networks and nacha, they could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations, which could adversely affect our business.
in order to provide our transaction processing services, several of our subsidiaries are registered with visa and mastercard and other networks as members or service providers for member institutions. a number of our subsidiaries outside the u.s. are direct members or associate members of visa and mastercard for purposes of conducting merchant acquiring, and various subsidiaries are also processor level members of numerous debit and electronic benefits transaction networks. as such, we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us or our clients to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks for certain acts or omissions by us, acquiring clients, processing clients or merchants. in addition, we are subject to nacha rules relating to payment transactions processed by us using the ach network and to various federal and state laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions, as well as the payment card industry data security standard enforced by the major card brands. the rules of nacha and the card networks are set by their respective boards, some of which are our competitors, and the card network rules may be influenced by card issuers, some of which offer competing transaction processing services.
if we fail to comply with these rules, we could be fined and our member registrations or certifications could be suspended or terminated. the suspension or termination of our member registrations or certifications, or any changes to the association and network rules, that we do not successfully address, or any other action by the card networks to restrict our ability to process transactions over such networks, could limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to clients and result in a reduction of revenue or increased costs of operation, which, in either case, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
a heightened regulatory environment in the financial services industry may have an adverse impact on our clients and our business.
since the enactment of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ("dodd-frank act"), a number of substantial regulations affecting the supervision and operation of the financial services industry within the u.s. have been adopted, including those that establish the consumer financial protection bureau ("cfpb"). the cfpb has issued guidance that applies to, and conducts direct examinations of, "supervised banks and nonbanks" as well as "supervised service providers" like us. cfpb rules, examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs. changes to the dodd-frank act or regulations could adversely impact our debit network business. in addition, certain of our alliance partners are subject to regulation by federal and state authorities and, as a result, could pass through some of those compliance obligations to us.
additional regulation, examination or oversight of our business could require us to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our clients; directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services; require us to invest additional time and resources to comply with such oversight and regulations, including in respect of audits, investigations or enforcement actions related to us or third parties; or limit our ability to update our existing products and services, or require us to develop new ones. if this oversight or regulation negatively impacts the business, operations or financial condition of our clients, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because, among other matters, our clients could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us, could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business, or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions. any of these events, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
legislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results.
cybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention. in europe, the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") extends the scope of the e.u. data protection law to all companies processing data of individuals within the e.u., regardless of the company's location, subject to certain limitations. the law requires companies to meet stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data. e.u. data protection law continuously develops and requires significant changes to our policies and procedures. for example, in 2020, the court of justice of the e.u. issued a decision that invalidated the european commission's adequacy decision for the e.u.-u.s. privacy shield framework and placed additional safeguards necessary for transfers of personal data to the u.s., requiring companies and regulators to conduct case-by-case analyses to determine whether foreign protections concerning government access to transferred data meet e.u. standards. together with our vendors and clients, we have been directly impacted by this decision, and our ability to transfer data outside the e.u. may be further impacted by determinations made by regulators in the e.u. we are also subject to u.k. gdpr following the u.k.'s exit from the e.u. single market and customs union. our efforts to comply with e.u., u.k. and other privacy and data protection laws around the world that apply to our businesses could involve substantial expenses, divert resources from other initiatives and projects and limit the services we are able to offer. there is also increased focus on data localization requirements around the world in countries such as the united arab emirates, china and india which could impact our business model with respect to our storage and transfer of personal data. failure to comply with applicable laws in this area could also result in significant fines, penalties and reputational damage.
in addition, u.s. banking agencies have adopted or proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our financial institution clients and that would address cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. several states also have adopted or proposed new privacy and cybersecurity laws targeting these issues. legislation and regulations on cybersecurity, data privacy and data localization may compel us to enhance or modify our systems, invest in new systems or alter our business practices or our policies on data governance and privacy. if any of these outcomes were to occur, our operational costs could increase significantly.
failure to comply with state and federal antitrust requirements could adversely affect our business.
through our merchant alliances, we hold an ownership interest in several competing merchant acquiring businesses while serving as an electronic processor for those businesses. in order to satisfy state and federal antitrust requirements, we actively maintain an antitrust compliance program. notwithstanding our compliance program, it is possible that perceived or actual violations of state or federal antitrust requirements could give rise to regulatory enforcement investigations or actions. regulatory scrutiny of, or regulatory enforcement action in connection with, compliance with state and federal antitrust requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.
we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others.
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. we expose ourselves to additional liability when we agree to defend or indemnify our clients against third-party infringement claims. if the owner of intellectual property establishes that we are, or a client which we are obligated to indemnify is, infringing its intellectual property rights, we may be forced to change our products or services, and such changes may be expensive or impractical, or we may need to seek royalty or license agreements from the owner of such rights. if we are unable to agree on acceptable terms, we may be required to discontinue the sale of key products or halt other aspects of our operations. we may also be liable for financial damages for a violation of intellectual property rights, and we may incur expenses in connection with indemnifying our clients against losses suffered by them. any adverse result related to violation of third-party intellectual property rights could materially and adversely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. even if intellectual property claims brought against us are without merit, they may result in costly and time-consuming litigation and may require significant attention from our management and key personnel.
misappropriation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position.
our ability to compete depends upon proprietary systems and technology. we actively seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. nevertheless, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of technology. agreements entered into for that purpose may not be enforceable or provide us with an adequate remedy. it is also possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology. further, we use open source software in connection with our solutions. companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of solutions developed using open source software. as a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our applications and services are made available. the laws of certain non-u.s. countries where we do business or contemplate doing business in the future may not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the u.s. misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation concerning such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
changes in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows from operations.
our operations are subject to tax by federal, state, local, and international taxing jurisdictions. changes in tax laws or their interpretations in our significant tax jurisdictions could materially increase the amount of taxes we owe, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations. additionally, future tax laws, regulations or guidance from the internal revenue service, the securities and exchange commission or the financial accounting standards board could cause us to adjust current estimates in future periods, which could impact our earnings and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.
the u.s. congress, the organization for economic co-operation and development (the "oecd") and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we do business remain focused on the taxation of multinational corporations. the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, including the u.s., is contemplating changes to numerous longstanding tax principles, including ensuring all companies pay a global minimum tax and expanding taxing rights of market countries. because the timing of implementation and the specific measures adopted will vary among participating countries, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of these initiatives and their implementation could adversely affect our business or financial results.
furthermore, our implementation of new practices and processes designed to comply with changing tax laws and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows from operations.
our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal, state, local and international taxing authorities. an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations. we have established contingency reserves for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. these reserves reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority. while we believe that the reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there is no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost not in excess of any related reserve. an unfavorable resolution, therefore, could negatively impact our effective tax rate, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in the current and/or future periods.
organizational and financial risks the failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we depend on the experience, skill and contributions of our senior management and other key employees. if we fail to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified management, technical, compliance and sales personnel, our future success could be harmed. our senior management provides strategic direction for our company, and if we lose members of our leadership team, our management resources may have to be diverted from other priorities to address this loss. our products and services require sophisticated knowledge of the financial services industry, applicable regulatory and industry requirements, computer systems, and software applications, and if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel, we could suffer delays in new product development, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients' demands.
losses due to chargebacks, refunds or returns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we may be liable if our merchants or other parties that have obligations to deliver goods or services to cardholders fail to satisfy their obligations. for example, we and our merchant acquiring alliances may be subject to contingent liability for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants or other parties. these disputes could arise from fraud, misuse, unintentional use, settlement delay or failure, insufficiency of funds, returns, a failure to perform a service, or other reasons. if we or the alliance is unable to collect this amount from the merchant or other party because of the merchant's or other party's insolvency or other reasons, we or the alliance will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. although we have an active program to manage our credit risk, and often mitigate our risk by obtaining collateral, a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business, and results of operations and financial condition.
additionally, we may be subject to potential liability for fraudulent transactions, including electronic payment and card transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others. examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit, debit or prepaid card, card number or other credentials to record a false sales transaction, processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud. we also rely on isos to sell our merchant processing services, which they may do by contracting with their own sub-isos. we rely on these isos and sub-isos to exercise appropriate controls to avoid fraudulent transactions. it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud, or otherwise effectively administer our chargeback responsibilities, would increase our chargeback liability and expose us to fines or other liabilities. increases in chargebacks, fines or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
acquisitions subject us to risks, including assumption of unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations.
a major contributor to our growth in revenue and earnings since our inception has been our ability to identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses. we anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire complementary businesses, products and services. we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions in the future, which could adversely affect our future growth; or businesses that we acquire may not perform as well as expected or may be more difficult or expensive to integrate and manage than expected, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. we may not be able to integrate all aspects of acquired businesses successfully or realize the potential benefits of bringing them together. in addition, the process of integrating these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert our resources.
in addition, acquisitions outside of the u.s. often involve additional or increased risks including, for example:
•managing geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;
•integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures;
•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•enforcement of intellectual property rights in some non-u.s. countries;
•difficulty entering new non-u.s. markets due to, among other things, consumer acceptance and business knowledge of these new markets; and
•general economic and political conditions.
these risks may arise for a number of reasons: we may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at affordable valuations or on other acceptable terms; we may face competition for acquisitions from other potential acquirers; we may need to borrow money or sell equity or debt securities to the public to finance acquisitions and the terms of these financings may be adverse to us; changes in accounting, tax, securities or other regulations could increase the difficulty or cost for us to complete acquisitions; we may incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with acquisitions; we may need to devote unanticipated financial and management resources to an acquired business; we may not realize expected operating efficiencies or product integration benefits from an acquisition; we could enter markets where we have minimal prior experience; and we may experience decreases in earnings as a result of non-cash impairment charges.
we may be obligated to indemnify the purchasers of businesses pursuant to the terms of the relevant purchase and sale agreements.
we have in the past and may in the future sell businesses. in connection with sales of businesses, we may make representations and warranties about the businesses and their financial affairs and agree to retain certain liabilities associated with our operation of the businesses prior to their sale. our obligation to indemnify the purchasers and agreement to retain liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. the impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our results of operations.
our balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent 59% of our total assets at december 31, 2022. these assets consist primarily of goodwill and identified intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. on at least an annual basis, we assess whether there have been impairments in the carrying value of goodwill. in addition, we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if the carrying value of the asset is determined to be impaired, then it is written down to fair value by a non-cash charge to operating earnings. an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.
existing or future leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations.
at december 31, 2022, we had approximately $21.4 billion of debt. we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. our indebtedness could: decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes; limit our flexibility to make acquisitions; increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, if certain of our outstanding senior notes or commercial paper notes are downgraded to below investment grade, we may incur additional interest expense. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements, including due to further deterioration in economic and market conditions, we may be required, among other things: to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements. in addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms.
an increase in interest rates may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.
certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, term loan, foreign lines of credit and commercial paper programs, are at variable rates of interest. during 2022, interest rates increased significantly and interest rates may continue to increase or remain at higher than recent historical levels in the future. an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense. at december 31, 2022, we had approximately $4.0 billion in variable rate debt, which includes $200 million on our term loan, $233 million drawn on our revolving credit facility and foreign lines of credit, and an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion outstanding under our u.s. dollar and euro commercial paper programs. based on outstanding debt balances and interest rates at december 31, 2022, a 1% increase in variable interest rates would result in an increase to annual interest expense of $40 million.
our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
we are subject to risks related to changes in currency rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. revenues and profit generated by such international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. from time to time, we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and other hedging instruments to mitigate the market value risks associated with foreign currency-denominated transactions and investments. these hedging strategies may not, however, eliminate all of the risks related to foreign currency translation, and we may forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if currency exchange rates were to change in our favor. we have also issued foreign currency-denominated senior notes and commercial paper notes for which payments of interest and principal are to be made in foreign currency, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could cause the expense associated with such payments to increase. in addition, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign revenue currencies into u.s. dollars. any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues and earnings we derive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.

dispositions on october 17, 2022, we sold fiserv costa rica, s.a. and our systems integration services ("sis") operations, which provides information technology engineering services in the united states ("u.s.") and india, to a single buyer. fiserv costa rica, s.a. and sis were reported primarily within our fintech segment. on september 30, 2022, we sold our korea operations, which were reported within our acceptance segment. we sold these operations for total consideration of $99 million and recognized an aggregate net pre-tax loss on the sales of $83 million. these divestitures were the result of a strategic review of our business portfolio.
we mutually agreed with a minority partner to terminate one of our merchant alliance joint ventures effective march 2022. in conjunction with such termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain merchant contracts of the joint venture for $175 million, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $137 million.
enterprise priorities we aspire to move money and information in a way that moves the world. our purpose is to deliver superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do. we are focused on driving growth and creating value by assembling a high-performing and diverse team, integrating our solutions, delivering operational excellence, allocating capital in a disciplined manner, including share repurchase and merger and acquisition activity, and delivering breakthrough innovation. our long-term priorities are to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our financial commitments; deepen client relationships with an emphasis on digital channels and payment solutions; deliver innovation and integration enabling differentiated value for our clients; and generate integration value, including cost and revenue synergies from acquisitions.
industry trends the global payments landscape continues to evolve, with rapidly advancing technologies and a steady expansion of digital payments, e-commerce and real-time payments infrastructure. because of this growth, competition also continues to intensify. business and consumer expectations continue to rise, with a focus on speed, convenience, choice and security. to meet these expectations, payments companies are focused on modernizing their technology, expanding the use of data and enhancing the customer experience.
merchants the rapid growth in and globalization of mobile and e-commerce, driven by consumers' desire for simpler, more efficient shopping experiences, has created an opportunity for merchants to reach consumers nearly anywhere, through any device, which often requires a merchant acquiring provider to enable and optimize the acceptance of payments. merchants are demanding simpler, integrated and flexible systems to accept payments and help manage their everyday business operations. when combined with the ever-increasing ways a consumer can pay for goods and services, merchants have sought modern systems to streamline the complexity. furthermore, merchants can now search, discover, compare, purchase and even install a new system through direct, digital-only experiences. this direct, digital-only channel is a source of new merchant acquisition opportunities, especially with respect to smaller merchants.
additionally, there are numerous software-as-a-service ("saas") solution providers in the industry, many of which have chosen to integrate merchant acquiring into their software as a way to further monetize their client relationships. such providers are typically referred to as isvs, and we believe there are thousands of these potential distribution partnership opportunities available to us.
we believe that our merchant acquiring products and solutions create compelling value propositions for merchant clients of all sizes, from small and mid-sized businesses to medium-sized regional businesses to global enterprise merchants, and across all verticals. furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with valued partnerships with merchant acquiring businesses of financial and non-financial institutions of all sizes, gives us a solid foundation for growth.
financial institutions and other financial technology providers financial services providers regularly introduce and implement new payment, deposit, risk management, lending and investment products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions and other financial technology providers continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. at the same time, the evolving global regulatory and cybersecurity landscape has continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. these conditions are driving heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. in addition, the focus on the customer experience, including through mobile and online engagement, by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, continues to elevate the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions.
we expect that financial institutions and other financial technology providers will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes in an evolving marketplace. we believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including a unified, seamless customer experience across mobile and online channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us.
the number of financial institutions in the united states has declined at a relatively steady rate, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations transfer accounts among financial institutions. if a client loss occurs due to merger or acquisition, we typically receive a contract termination fee based on the size of the client and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. these fees can vary from period to period with the variance depending on the quantum of financial institution merger activity in a given period and whether or not our clients are involved in the activity. our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has also reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. furthermore, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth.
recent market conditions global macroeconomic conditions, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation, disruptions in the global supply chain, the effects of the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine, the continuing impact of the coronavirus ("covid-19") pandemic, and regulations restricting trade or that impact our ability to offer products or services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, since 2021, we have observed increased shortages and delays in the global supply chain for components and inputs necessary to our businesses, such as semiconductors, paper and plastic, and may experience difficulty procuring those components and inputs in the future on a timely basis or at historical prices. for discussion of risks related to potential impacts of supply chain, geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges on our business, results of operations and financial condition, see "item 1a. risk factors."
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, including for recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates.
acquisitions from time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. the estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. the determination of fair value requires estimates about discount rates, growth and retention rates, royalty rates, expected future cash flows and other future events that are judgmental in nature. while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. additional information regarding our acquisitions is included in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
goodwill and intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is one level below our reportable segments. when reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the prior test's amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit's last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. when performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test.
the quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. we determine the fair value of a reporting unit using both a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach. determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions.
our most recent annual impairment assessment of our reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2022 determined that our goodwill of $36.8 billion was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units exceeded the carrying values. however, for four of our reporting units, with aggregate goodwill of $10.9 billion, the excess of the respective reporting unit's fair value over carrying value ranged from 7 to 18 percent. if future operating performance is below our expectations or there are material changes to forecasted revenue growth rates or operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates, foreign currency exchange rates, effective income tax rates, or some combination thereof, a decline in the fair value of the reporting units could result in, and we may be required to record, a goodwill impairment charge. additionally, a significant change in a merchant alliance business relationship or operating performance could result in a material goodwill impairment charge. it is also reasonably possible that future developments related to the interest rate environment, a shift in strategic initiatives, or significant changes in the composition of certain of our reporting units could have a future material impact on one or more of the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate goodwill impairment. we have no accumulated goodwill impairment through december 31, 2022. additional information regarding our goodwill is included in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. we review capitalized software development costs for impairment at each reporting date. recoverability of intangible assets is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to either the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or the net realizable value of the asset, depending on the type of asset. determining future cash flows and net realizable values involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future economic and market conditions. measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. additional information regarding our intangible assets is included in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. as a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.
processing and services processing and services revenue is generated from account- and transaction-based fees for data processing, merchant transaction processing and acquiring, electronic billing and payment services, electronic funds transfer and debit/credit processing services; consulting and professional services; and software maintenance for ongoing client support.
we recognize processing and services revenue in the period in which the specific service is performed unless they are not deemed distinct from other goods or services, which revenue would then be recognized as control is transferred of the combined goods and services. our arrangements for processing and services typically consist of an obligation to provide specific services to our customers on a when- and if-needed basis (a stand-ready obligation) and revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer. these services are typically provided under a fixed or declining (tier-based) price per unit based on volume of service; however, pricing for services may also be based on minimum monthly usage fees. fees for our processing and services arrangements are typically billed and paid on a monthly basis.
product product revenue is generated from print and card production sales, as well as software license and hardware (primarily pos devices) sales. for software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery, assuming a contract is deemed to exist. revenue for arrangements with customers that include significant customization, modification or production of software such that the software is not distinct is typically recognized over time based upon efforts expended, such as labor hours, to measure progress towards completion. for arrangements involving hosted licensed software for the customer, a software element is considered present to the extent the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for the customer to either operate the software on their own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. we sell or lease hardware (pos devices) and other peripherals as part of our contracts with customers. hardware typically consists of terminals or clover devices. we do not manufacture hardware, rather we purchase hardware from third-party vendors and hold such hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer. we account for the sale of hardware as a separate performance obligation and recognize the revenue at the standalone selling price when the customer obtains control of the hardware.
significant judgments we use the following methods, inputs and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. for multi-element arrangements, we account for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, if the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. if these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.
technology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our applications or service offerings. whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained involves judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances, including the level of contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, to determine whether we obtain control of goods and services prior to their transfer to a customer.
the transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer. we include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. to the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. we may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted. the transaction price (including any discounts or rebates) is allocated between distinct goods and services in a multi-element arrangement based on their relative standalone selling prices. for items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service.
contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price (or both) of the contract, or when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. when a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to determine if the modification should be accounted for as (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance obligation. additional information regarding our revenue recognition policies is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires management's judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, sometimes made more complex by our global footprint. judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. we establish a liability for known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. in establishing a liability for known tax exposures, assumptions are made in determining whether, and the extent to which, a tax position will be sustained. a tax benefit with respect to a tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority, based on its technical merits, considering the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. the amount of tax benefit recognized reflects the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on settlement with the relevant taxing authority. as additional information becomes available, we evaluate our tax positions and adjust our liability for known tax exposures as appropriate.
we maintain net operating loss carryforwards in various taxing jurisdictions, resulting in the establishment of deferred tax assets. we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when, based upon the weight of all available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in making this determination, we have considered the relative impact of all of the available positive and negative evidence regarding future sources of taxable income and available tax planning strategies. however, there could be a material impact to our effective income tax rate if there is a significant change in our judgment. to the extent our judgment changes, the valuation allowances are then adjusted, generally through the provision for income taxes, in the period in which the change in facts and circumstances occurs. additional information regarding our income taxes is included in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

total revenue total revenue increased $1,511 million, or 9%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the revenue increase was driven by higher processing revenue and product sales across all of our business segments, partially offset by a 2% decrease due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
revenue in our acceptance segment increased $813 million, or 13%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the revenue increase was driven by higher global merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes, an increase in the number of active merchants on our clover operating system and the expansion of our merchant relationships through value-added services. the revenue growth of our clover and carat operating systems were above pre-covid-19 pandemic levels and contributed 5% and 1%, respectively, to acceptance segment growth. the remaining revenue growth in our acceptance segment was attributable to higher merchant acquiring payment and transaction volumes across our other merchant acquiring platforms.
revenue in our fintech segment increased $148 million, or 5%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the revenue increase was driven by both higher processing revenue and license and termination fee revenue across our fintech businesses, with each contributing approximately 2% to fintech revenue growth.
revenue in our payments segment increased $429 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. the revenue increase was driven by our debit processing business, which contributed 3% to payments segment revenue growth through new client wins on our network routing services; our output solutions business, which contributed 2%, primarily driven by new client growth; and our credit processing business, which contributed 1%, primarily driven by an increase in active accounts.

cost of product as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 67.8% in 2022 compared to 70.0% in 2021. the cost of product as a percentage of product revenue improved in 2022 as a result of higher margin revenue growth.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 34.2% in 2022 compared to 35.8% in 2021. the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2022 was primarily due to a reduction in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of approximately 100 basis points.
the net gain on sale of businesses and other assets in 2022 included a $137 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain merchant contracts in conjunction with the mutual termination of one of our merchant alliance joint ventures and a $44 million pre-tax gain from the sale of fiserv costa rica, s.a. and our sis operations. these gains were partially offset by a $127 million pre-tax loss from the sale of our korea operations.

operating income in our acceptance segment increased $325 million, or 16%, in 2022 compared to 2021. operating margin increased 100 basis points to 31.8% in 2022 compared to 2021. operating margin growth in 2022 was primarily due to operating leverage and the divestiture of a lower-margin business within the acceptance segment.
operating income in our fintech segment increased $76 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. operating margin increased 70 basis points to 36.5% in 2022 compared to 2021. fintech segment operating income and margin growth in 2022 was due to an increase in license and termination fee revenue.

income tax provision income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes and income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was 18.9% and 21.8% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. the decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily the result of $134 million of income tax expense in 2021 attributed to the revaluation of certain net deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangible assets and investments in joint ventures recognized at fair value in connection with the acquisition of first data corporation, reflecting the effect of enacted corporate income tax rate changes in the united kingdom (tax rate increase from 19% to 25% starting in 2023) and argentina (tax rate increase from 25% to 35%).
income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates our share of net income from affiliates accounted for using the equity method is reported as income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and the related tax expense is reported within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including acquired intangible asset amortization from valuations in purchase accounting, was $220 million and $100 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2022 includes pre-tax gains totaling $209 million, primarily related to the acquisition-date fair value remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in finxact of $110 million, as well as $80 million resulting from the dilution of our ownership interest in conjunction with the sagent m&c, llc transaction with a third party. income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2021 included a $33 million pre-tax gain resulting from the sale of our remaining ownership interest in investcloud holdings, llc ("investcloud"), as well as a $28 million pre-tax gain resulting from the dilution of our ownership interest in connection with the tegra118 merger with a third party.

liquidity and capital resources general our primary liquidity needs in the ordinary course of business are to: (i) fund normal operating expenses; (ii) meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness, including finance leases; and (iii) fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. we believe these needs will be satisfied in both the short and long term using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $902 million, proceeds from the issuance of u.s. dollar and euro commercial paper, and available capacity under our revolving credit facility of $870 million (net of outstanding borrowings and $5.1 billion of capacity designated for outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs, senior notes due in 2023 and letters of credit) at december 31, 2022.
the following table summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively:

net cash provided by operating activities                                           $4,618                      $4,034                     $584                            14   %
capital expenditures, including capitalized software and other intangibles          $1,479                      $1,160                     $319                            28   %
our operating cash flow was $4.6 billion in 2022, an increase of 14% compared with $4.0 billion in 2021. this increase was primarily attributable to improved operating results, partially offset by higher working capital use compared to the prior year, including increased accounts receivable corresponding to revenue growth and slower customer payments, as well as an increase in future credit card receivables purchased under our clover capital program.
our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. our capital expenditures were approximately 8% and 7% of our total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
cash requirements the following table details our future cash requirements under certain contractual obligations at december 31, 2022:

in 2021, new omaha holdings l.p. ("new omaha"), a shareholder of ours, completed an underwritten secondary public offering of 23.0 million shares of our common stock (the "offering"). we repurchased from the underwriters 5.0 million shares of our common stock that were subject to the offering. the share repurchase totaled $588 million and was funded with cash on hand. the repurchased shares were cancelled and no longer outstanding following the completion of the share repurchase.
acquisitions and dispositions acquisitions we acquired yacaré and merchant one in december 2022, nextable in september 2022 and city pos in june 2022. additionally, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in finxact in april 2022, in which we previously held a noncontrolling interest. we acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $994 million, net of $28 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions estimated at a fair value of $6 million. we funded these acquisitions in 2022 by utilizing a combination of available cash and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.
we acquired bentobox in november 2021, aip in october 2021, spendlabs in june 2021, pineapple payments in may 2021, and radius8 in march 2021. additionally, we acquired a remaining ownership interest in netpay in november 2021 and a remaining ownership interest in ondot in january 2021, in which we previously held noncontrolling equity interests. we acquired these businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $882 million, net of $43 million of acquired cash, and including earn-out provisions at an aggregate fair value of $34 million. we funded these acquisitions in 2021 by utilizing a combination of available cash, proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and existing availability under our revolving credit facility.
the results of operations for these acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition.
dispositions we sold fiserv costa rica, s.a. and our sis operations in october 2022 and our korea operations in september 2022 for aggregate net cash proceeds of $77 million, along with a minority noncontrolling equity interest in the buyer of the korea operations. effective march 2022, we mutually agreed to terminate a merchant alliance joint venture with a minority partner. in conjunction with such termination, the joint venture minority partner elected to exercise its option to purchase certain additional merchant contracts of the joint venture for cash proceeds of $175 million. the net proceeds from these dispositions were primarily used to pay down indebtedness and repurchase shares of our common stock.
we previously maintained a noncontrolling interest in tegra118, llc ("tegra118") which was accounted for under the equity method. in february 2021, tegra118 completed a merger with a third party, resulting in a dilution of our ownership interest in the combined new entity, wealthtech holdings, llc, which was subsequently renamed as investcloud. in connection with the transaction, we made an additional capital contribution, funded under our revolving credit facility, of $200 million into the combined entity and, in june 2021, we sold our entire ownership interest in investcloud for $466 million. the net proceeds from the sale were primarily used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our term loan facility.

at december 31, 2022, our debt consisted primarily of $16.8 billion of fixed-rate senior notes and $3.5 billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs. interest on our u.s. dollar-denominated senior notes is paid semi-annually, while interest on our euro and british pound-denominated senior notes is paid annually. interest on our revolving credit facility and commercial paper notes is generally paid weekly, or more frequently on occasion, and interest on our term loan is paid monthly. outstanding borrowings under our 0.375% euro-denominated senior notes due in july 2023, 3.800% senior notes due in october 2023, and u.s dollar and euro commercial paper programs are classified in the consolidated balance sheet as long-term, as we have the intent to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis through the continued issuance of new commercial paper notes upon maturity, and we also have the ability to refinance such borrowings under our revolving credit facility, as further discussed below.
in july 2022, we redeemed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 3.500% senior notes due in october 2022 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. we financed the redemption of these notes using proceeds from the issuance of u.s. dollar commercial paper. we also repaid $485 million, representing all amounts outstanding on our receivable securitized loan, in july 2022, using proceeds from the issuance of u.s. dollar commercial paper and terminated the underlying receivables financing agreement.
in june 2022, we entered into a new senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility with substantially the same syndicate of banks that were lenders under our prior amended and restated revolving credit facility, which we voluntarily terminated and replaced. the new credit agreement matures in june 2027 and provides for a maximum aggregate principal amount of availability of $6.0 billion.
variable rate debt our variable rate debt consisted of the following at december 31, 2022:
(in millions)                             maturity                weighted-average interest rate                 outstanding borrowings foreign lines of credit                   n/a                                             30.58%                         $198
we maintain certain short-term lines of credit with foreign banks and alliance partners primarily to fund settlement activity associated with international operations in latin america. we maintain u.s. dollar and euro unsecured commercial paper programs with various maturities generally ranging from one day to four months. outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper programs bear interest based on the prevailing rates at the time of issuance. in august 2022, we increased our u.s. commercial paper program borrowing capacity to $6.0 billion to align with the maximum amount of availability under our revolving credit facility.
as discussed above, we maintain a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments available for $6.0 billion of total capacity. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on a secured overnight financing rate ("sofr") or a base rate in the case of u.s. dollar borrowings, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. we are required to pay a facility fee based on the aggregate commitments in effect under the credit agreement from time to time.
we maintain a term loan credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. outstanding borrowings under the term loan bear interest at a variable rate based on one-month libor or a base rate, in each case plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time.
debt covenants and compliance the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. we may, at our option, redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the applicable maturity date.
the new revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.75 times our consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and expenses and certain other adjustments ("ebitda") during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions.
the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to, among other things, (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than 3.5 times our ebitda during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, subject to certain exceptions, and (ii) maintain ebitda of at least 3.0 times our consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. our ability to meet future debt covenant requirements will depend on our continued ability to generate earnings and cash flows. we expect to remain in compliance with all terms and conditions associated with our outstanding debt, including financial debt covenants.
debt guarantees we maintain noncontrolling ownership interests in sagent m&c, llc and defi solutions group, llc (collectively, the "lending joint ventures"). the lending joint ventures maintain, as amended in april 2022, variable-rate term loan facilities with aggregate outstanding borrowings of $437 million in senior unsecured debt at december 31, 2022 and variable-rate revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $83 million with a syndicate of banks, which mature in april 2027. there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities at december 31, 2022. we have guaranteed the debt of the lending joint ventures and do not anticipate that the lending joint ventures will fail to fulfill their debt obligations. we maintained a liability of $40 million at december 31, 2022 for the estimated fair value of our non-contingent obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee arrangements. such guarantees will be amortized in future periods over the contractual term of the debt. in addition, we maintained a contingent liability of $21 million at december 31, 2022, representing the current expected credit losses to which we are exposed. this contingent liability is estimated based on certain financial metrics of the lending joint ventures and historical industry data, which is used to develop assumptions of the likelihood the guaranteed parties will default and the level of credit losses in the event a default occurs. we have not made any payments under the guarantees, nor have we been called upon to do so.
other access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital and our ability to refinance maturing debt and fund future acquisitions. our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. as of december 31, 2022, we had a corporate credit rating of baa2 with a stable outlook from moody's investors service, inc. ("moody's") and bbb with a stable outlook from standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p") on our senior unsecured debt securities. as of december 31, 2022, we had a commercial paper credit rating of p-2 from moody's and a-2 from s&p.
the interest rates payable on certain of our senior notes, term loan and commercial paper notes programs are subject to adjustment from time to time if moody's or s&p changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. if the ratings from moody's or s&p decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates on certain senior notes are subject to increase by up to two percent. in no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.
cash and cash equivalents investments, exclusive of settlement assets, with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash are considered to be cash equivalents as reflected within our consolidated balance sheets. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, we held $902 million and $835 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively.
(1)represents cash held by our joint ventures that is not available to fund operations outside of those entities unless the board of directors of the relevant entity declares a dividend, as well as cash held by other entities that are subject to foreign exchange controls in certain countries or regulatory capital requirements.
employee termination costs we recorded $187 million and $95 million of employee termination costs related to cash severance and other separation costs for terminated employees during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. employee termination costs include those charges incurred in connection with the acquisition of first data corporation during the year ended december 31, 2021. the employee severance and other separation costs accrued balance of $23 million at december 31, 2022 is expected to be paid within the next twelve months.

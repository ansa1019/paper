item 1a. risk factors the following discussion addresses significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky and provides important information for the understanding of our "forward-looking statements," which are discussed immediately preceding item 7a of this form 10-k and elsewhere. the risk factors set forth in this item 1a should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report, including management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, item 7, and financial statements and supplementary data, item 8.
we urge you to consider carefully the factors described below and the risks that they present for our operations as well as the risks addressed in other reports and materials that we file with the sec and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10-k. when the factors, events, and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this form 10-k materialize, our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or prospects can be materially adversely affected. in such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.
strategic and operational risks we must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity - significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities or changes in consumer preferences that affect the businesses of our customers can lead to increased costs associated with resizing our operations, including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives, rail cars, and other equipment; workforce adjustments; and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. if there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network or shifts in traffic flow that are contrary to the designed capacity of our network, we may experience network difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity, that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers. this level of demand also may compound the impact of weather and weather-related events on our operations and velocity. although we continue to work to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, improve operations at our yards and other facilities, and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason by carrying a resource buffer, we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity. we may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity, dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers' demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating regions, or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency, which could all have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
we transport hazardous materials - we transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including crude oil, ethanol, and toxic inhalation hazard (tih) materials, such as chlorine, that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion. additionally, u.s. laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss. a rail accident or other incident or accident on our network, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations - we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us or under control of third-parties. if we do not have sufficient capital or do not deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire, develop, or implement new technology or maintain or upgrade current systems, such as positive train control (ptc) or the latest version of our transportation control systems, we may suffer a rail service outage or competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
we are subject to cybersecurity risks - we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us (whether created by us or purchased), under control of third-parties, and open-source software. although we devote significant resources to protect our technology systems and proprietary data, we have experienced and will likely continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to identify, prevent, or limit the effects of cyber incidents will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents do occur. furthermore, due to the rising numbers and increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, an increasingly complex information technology supply chain, and the nature of zero-day exploits, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent a security breach, including by ransomware or as a result of human error or other cyber-attack methods, from materially affecting our systems or the systems of third-parties upon which we rely. a cyber incident that results in significant service interruption; safety failure; other operational difficulties; unauthorized access to (or the loss of access to) competitively sensitive, confidential, or other critical data or systems; loss of customers; financial losses; regulatory fines; reputational harm; or misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. we may experience security breaches that could remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on us. additionally, we may be exposed to increased cybersecurity risk because we are a component of the critical u.s. infrastructure.
severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures - as a railroad with a vast network, we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures, avalanches, and significant precipitation, and climate change may cause or contribute to the severity or frequency of such weather conditions. line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions has in the past and can in the future adversely affect parts or all of our entire rail network, potentially negatively affecting revenues, costs, and liabilities, despite efforts we undertake to plan for these events. our revenues can also be adversely affected by severe weather that causes damage and disruptions to our customers. these impacts caused by severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
a significant portion of our revenues involves transportation of commodities to and from international markets - although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the u.s., a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets, including mexico, canada, and southeast asia, by various carriers and, at times, various modes of transportation. significant and sustained interruptions of trade with mexico, canada, or countries in southeast asia, including china, could adversely affect customers and other entities that, directly or indirectly, purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the u.s. as part of their operations, and any such interruptions, including international armed conflicts such as the russia-ukraine and israel-hamas wars, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with mexico, canada, or countries in southeast asia: (a) a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses; (b) the adverse impact of new laws, rules, and regulations or the interpretation of laws, rules, and regulations by government entities, courts, or regulatory bodies, including the united states-mexico-canada agreement (usmca) or other international trade agreements; (c) actions of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries; (d) any significant adverse economic developments, such as extended periods of high inflation, material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries, and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports; (e) shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets; (f) a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries; and (g) public health crises, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the coronavirus and its variant strains (covid).
we are dependent on certain key suppliers of locomotives and rail - due to the capital-intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment, parts, and maintenance, potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry. therefore, if one of the domestic suppliers of locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives, supplying parts, or providing maintenance for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency or the inability to manufacture locomotives that meet efficiency or regulatory emissions standards, we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations. additionally, we utilize a limited number of steel producers that meet our specifications. rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs, maintenance, and for adding additional network capacity, new rail and storage yards, and expansions of existing facilities. this industry similarly has high barriers to entry, and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency, we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects. changes to trade agreements or policies that result in increased tariffs on goods imported into the united states could also result in significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail.
workforce risks strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations - the u.s. class i railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. the majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements. disputes over the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions can lead to, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. labor disputes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts at loading/unloading facilities, ports, or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. labor disputes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations - changes in demographics, training requirements, and pandemic illnesses or restrictions could negatively affect the availability of qualified personnel for us, our customers, and throughout the supply chain. our ability to quickly react to other factors that affect our ability to attract and retain employees may be restricted due to limited flexibility to make unilateral changes to collective bargaining agreements, which cover the majority of our workforce. unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate our risks, which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
legal and regulatory risks we are subject to significant governmental regulation - we are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state, and local authorities covering a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, economic (as discussed below), tax, and other matters. many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks that we operate in without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution, increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation, business relationships with other railroads, use of embargoes, calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy, the prices we charge, changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, and revision in tax regulations. significant legislative activity in congress or regulatory activity by the stb could expand regulation of railroad operations and pricing for rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities, and equipment, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures - as a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and a vast rail network, we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, environmental liability, and other matters. any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. in addition, some of these matters could impact the cost of obtaining, or availability in general, of insurance coverage meant to cover these types of risks.
we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations - due to the nature of the railroad business, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and hazardous material or petroleum releases. we generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations. environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, properties owned by third-parties, as well as properties we currently own. environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third-parties in toxic tort litigation. we have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. we currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation, remediation, and monitoring, and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future. we maintain adequate reserves for liabilities for these obligations, but fluctuations of potential costs affect our estimates based on our experience and, as necessary, the advice and assistance of our consultants. however, actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors, including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws, technological changes affecting investigations and remediation, the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability, and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites. we could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown, or future environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
macroeconomic and industry risks we face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers - we face competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc. its primary subsidiary, bnsf railway company (bnsf), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. in addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. motor carrier competition exists in all three of our commodity groups. because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and gulf coast waterways, barges can be particularly competitive, especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. in addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality, and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service. however, railroads are much more fuel-efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure, and we have been making efforts to convert truck traffic to rail. additionally, we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, while trucks, barges, and maritime operators are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity: (a) improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks, (b) legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (c) legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products (e.g., natural gas instead of coal, sorghum instead of corn) or commodities from different locations (e.g., grain from states or countries that we do not serve, crude oil from different regions). sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices. additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitive environment.
we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change - climate change, including the impact of global warming and transition risks involving policy, legal risks, and market risks, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity over both a long-term and near-term basis. restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of ghgs, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that (a) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (c) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy, emissions reductions, and ghg emissions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry and demand for our services, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy also could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, increasing royalties charged to producers of prb coal by the u.s. department of interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation or complying with laws or regulations related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. violent weather caused by climate change, including hurricanes, fires, floods, extreme temperatures, avalanches, and significant precipitation has in the past and could in the future cause line outages and other interruptions to our infrastructure. any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unpredictable impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. our efforts to achieve emission reduction targets could significantly increase our operational costs and capital expenditures. in addition, stakeholder expectations regarding some of these matters may be evolving and there may be differing views among stakeholders, which could harm our reputation or increase our costs.
our business, financial condition, and results of operations have been adversely affected, and in the future, could be materially adversely affected by pandemics or other public health crises - pandemics, epidemics, and other outbreaks of disease can have significant and widespread impacts. as we saw during the peaks of the covid pandemic, outbreaks of disease can cause a global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, resulting further in adverse effects on workforces, customers, and regional and local economies. the impact of pandemics or public health crises on our results of operations and financial condition may depend on numerous evolving factors, including, but not limited to: governmental, business, and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to a global pandemic or other public health crises (including restrictions on travel and transport, workforce pressures, social distancing, and shelter-in-place orders); the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and their demand for our services; the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on the credit-worthiness of our customers; national or global supply chain challenges or disruption; facility closures; commodity cost volatility; general macroeconomic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides as well as response to a potential reoccurrence. further, a pandemic or other public health crises, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from such an event, could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factors that we identify, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability), and/or stock price. additionally, a pandemic or other public health crises also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.
financial risks we are affected by fluctuating fuel prices - fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses. diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenues from fuel surcharges, we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. additionally, future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges. as fuel prices fluctuate, our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel prices by approximately two months, and may be a significant source of quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year volatility, particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices. international, political, and economic factors, events and conditions, including international armed conflicts such as the russia-ukraine and israel-hamas wars, affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies. weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. a severe shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. alternatively, lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport. however, lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport, such as coal and domestic drilling-related shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
we rely on capital markets - due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements. we utilize long-term debt instruments, bank financing, and commercial paper, and we pledge certain amount of our receivables as collateral for credit. significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including, among other things, elevated interest rates in the credit markets and/or changes in interest rates, or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to, and significantly increase the cost of, commercial paper and other financing sources, including bank credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt, including corporate bonds. a significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade, which could restrict us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility (receivables facility). this may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.
general risk factors we are affected by general economic conditions - prolonged, severe adverse domestic and global macroeconomic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets, including, for example, the recessionary fears, inflationary pressures, and elevated interest rates we are seeing in the current economic environment, may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.
we may be affected by acts of terrorism, war, or risk of war - our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, including rail cars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. terrorist attacks, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. in addition, insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8, and other information in this report, including risk factors set forth in item 1a and critical accounting estimates and cautionary information at the end of this item 7. the following section generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7, of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2022.
the railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. although we provide and analyze revenues by commodity group, we treat the financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network.
●   safety - we initiated changes to our safety program that focused on training, culture, and refreshing how teams communicate and look out for each other. an analysis of historical injury data identified a large portion of our reportable injuries involve a failure to comply with a small number of critical operating rules. these critical rules are the foundation of our new program that is being implemented. while our reportable personal injury incidents rate per 200,000 employee-hours deteriorated 4% from 2022, we improved in the latter part of the year. we continued to refine our proprietary software called precision train builder to evaluate train and route characteristics to enable proactive intervention by our operating practices command center to prevent derailments. in addition, the software allows the team to simulate in-train forces to avoid train handling that would generate forces greater than tolerance limits. these efforts helped to drive our reportable derailment incident rate per million train miles down 6% year-over-year. further supporting our efforts, in march, the aar announced a set of key safety actions. these include the installation of additional hot wheel bearing wayside detectors and enhanced standards for how we proactively use and share critical data. in addition, the industry is expanding efforts in first responder training and deploying technology to provide real-time railcar condition monitoring.
●   service - car trip plan compliance for both intermodal and manifest/automotive products improved compared to 2022. throughout the year we improved network fluidity as reflected in faster freight car velocity and lower terminal dwell. we graduated over 1,900 train, engine, and yard employees to backfill attrition, cover absences resulting from recently negotiated sick leave benefits, and added employees in areas of critical need to address operational challenges and support our service product.
●   operational excellence - the year began with weather disruptions across the network that impacted our operations. we deployed additional locomotives and aggressively hired train, engine, and yard employees to alleviate these operational challenges. despite the challenges, we continued to focus on using our resources effectively and productively, which resulted in sequential improvement in many of our operating metrics.
●   financial results - soft consumer markets, inflationary pressures, new labor agreements, fluctuating fuel prices, operational issues, and first quarter weather disruptions negatively impacted our financial results. operating income of $9.1 billion declined 8% from 2022, and operating ratio was 62.3%, deteriorating 2.2 points from 2022. net income of $6.4 billion translated into earnings of $10.45 per diluted share, down 7% from 2022. despite the challenging year, we generated $8.4 billion of cash provided by operating activities, yielded free cash flow of $1.5 billion after reductions of $3.7 billion for cash used in investing activities and $3.2 billion in dividends. both cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were lowered by $454 million of payments related to the 2022 one-time charge for agreements reached with our labor unions and the ratification charge for a crew staffing agreement reached in the second quarter of 2023.
free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid. free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation s-k and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. we believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing. free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (gaap measure) to free cash flow (non-gaap measure):
cash provided by operating activities             $8,379                 $9,362                 $9,032
●   safety - our goal is to be an industry leader in safety. we plan to improve the safety culture through our courage to care program. courage to care is reflected in actions such as giving and receiving feedback on unsafe behavior, finding and eliminating risk, and improving the safety of the work environment, so that everyone returns home safely. an enhanced safety management program focused on the critical rules that most impact safety will be rolled out to all employees in 2024. in addition, train, engine, and yard employees will be expected to attend a full day safety training class to reinforce these critical rules. we will continue using a comprehensive safety management approach utilizing technology, hazard identification and risk assessments, employee engagement, training, quality control, and targeted capital investments. in addition, our operating practices command center will help position us to implement predictive technology to reduce variability by seeking to identify causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions in addition to assisting employees with understanding best practices for handling trains. we plan to utilize data to identify and mitigate exposure to risk, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings, and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs, and local community activities across the network. operating a safe railroad benefits all our stakeholders: employees, customers, shareholders, and the communities we serve, while protecting the environment for future generations.
●   service - we are committed to delivering the service we sold to our customers. as we meet with customers to agree on their specific needs and outcomes, we will measure ourselves against the best service we provided them over the past three years and use that as a guide for meeting their expectations. we will engage with customers to understand how we win together.
●   operational excellence - to provide our customers with the service we sold, we must run a fluid network. network fluidity enables us to effectively utilize all our resources and provides the capacity to respond in an ever-changing environment. we will continue to transform our railroad to further improve our service product, improve resource utilization, and lower our overall cost structure.
●   business volumes - macroeconomic uncertainties remain in 2024 that could have a material impact on our 2024 financial and operating results. current forecasts for 2024 industrial production are flat versus 2023. in addition, other factors, such as changes in domestic and foreign monetary policy (including rising interest rates), may affect economic activity and demand for rail transportation; natural gas prices, weather conditions, and demand for other energy sources may impact the coal market; crude oil prices and spreads may drive demand for petroleum products and drilling materials; available truck capacity could impact our intermodal business; and international trade agreements could promote or hinder trade. lower coal demand and some lost international intermodal business are expected to negatively impact volume. fuel prices may continue to fluctuate in the current economic environment. as prices fluctuate, there will be a timing impact on earnings, as our fuel surcharge programs trail increases or decreases in fuel prices by approximately two months. regardless of external factors, we will focus on operating a safe railroad and delivering the service we sold to our customers as well as effective asset utilization, cost control, and seeking new business opportunities.
results of operations operating revenues
% change             % change we generate freight revenues by transporting products from our three commodity groups. freight revenues vary with volume (carloads) and average revenue per car (arc). changes in price, traffic mix, and fuel surcharges drive arc. customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes, are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. customer incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available historical, current, and forecasted volumes, and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied. we recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. the allocation of revenues between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.
other subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. the allocation of revenues between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. accessorial revenues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.
freight revenues decreased 3% year-over-year to $22.6 billion driven by lower fuel surcharge revenues, negative mix of traffic (decreased lumber shipments and increased short haul rock shipments), and a 1% decrease in volume, partially offset by core pricing gains. volume decreases were primarily driven by weaker demand for intermodal and coal shipments. these declines were partially offset by a domestic intermodal contract win, increased production and inventory replenishment in the automotive industry, growth in petroleum and lpg shipments, and strength in rock shipments.
our fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of $3.0 billion and $3.7 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. fuel surcharge revenues in 2023 decreased $0.7 billion due to a 15% decrease in fuel prices and lower volume, partially offset by the impact of fluctuating fuel prices (it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recoveries).
the following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in freight revenues, revenue carloads, and arc by commodity type:

operating expenses increased $79 million, or 1%, in 2023 compared to 2022 driven by inflation; operational challenges in the first half of the year, including additional costs related to weather; increased workforce levels, including the impact of increased sick leave benefits provided to our craft professionals; higher casualty costs; and the ratification charge for a crew staffing agreement reached in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by lower fuel prices, a one-time charge in 2022 for agreements reached with our labor unions, and volume related costs.   2023 operating expenses compensation and benefits - compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, and incentive costs. in 2023, expenses increased 4% compared to 2022. the employee level increase of 3% includes a 4% increase in train, engine, and yard employees to backfill attrition, cover absences resulting from recent negotiated sick leave benefits, and add employees in areas of critical need to address operational challenges and support our service product. the wage growth, costs for training, and the ratification charge for a crew staffing agreement reached in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by the 2022 one-time charge for agreements reached with our labor unions, lower incentive compensation, and lower volume drove the increase in compensation and benefits for 2023 compared to 2022.
fuel - fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. fuel expense decreased compared to 2022 due to a decrease in locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $3.09 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2023 compared to $3.65 per gallon in 2022, resulting in a $0.5 billion decrease in expense (excluding any impact from decreased volume year-over-year), and a 1% decrease in gross ton-miles, partially offset by a 1% deterioration to the fuel consumption rate in 2023 (computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles).
purchased services and materials - expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the railroad's lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by uprr and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and tools and supplies. purchased services and materials increased 7% in 2023 compared to 2022 driven by higher locomotive maintenance expenses due to inflation, increased locomotive overhauls, and a larger active fleet in the first half of 2023 to assist in recovering the network, partially offset by decreased volume-related drayage costs incurred at one of our subsidiaries.
depreciation - the majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. depreciation expense was up 3% in 2023 compared to 2022 due to a higher depreciable asset base.
equipment and other rents - equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expenses, offset by equity income from certain equity method investments. equipment and other rents expense increased 5% compared to 2022 due to lower equity income and inflation, partially offset by greater network fluidity and lower volume.
other - other expenses include state and local taxes; freight, equipment, and property damage; utilities; insurance; personal injury; environmental; employee travel; telephone and cellular; computer software; bad debt; and other general expenses. other expenses increased 12% in 2023 compared to 2022 driven by casualty expenses, including higher personal injury expense, environmental remediation, and damaged freight, and one-time write-offs.
non-operating items
% change             % change other income, net - other income increased in 2023 compared to 2022 driven by a one-time $107 million real estate transaction, partially offset by lower gains from real estate sales. real estate sales in 2022 included a $79 million gain from a land sale to the illinois state toll highway authority and a $35 million gain from a land sale to the colorado department of transportation. see note 6 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8, for additional detail.
interest expense - interest expense increased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to an increased weighted-average debt level of $33.2 billion in 2023 from $32.1 billion in 2022. the effective interest rate was 4.0% in both periods.
income tax expense - income tax expense decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower pre-tax income and deferred tax expense reductions. in 2023, the states of nebraska, iowa, kansas, and arkansas enacted legislation to reduce their corporate income tax rates for future years resulting in a $114 million reduction of our deferred tax expense. 2022 income tax expense included reductions of $95 million in deferred tax expense from nebraska, iowa, arkansas, and idaho reducing their corporate income tax rates. our effective tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were 22.5% and 22.9%, respectively.

[b]   methodology used to report (described below) is not comparable with the reporting to the stb under docket number ep 770.
gross and revenue ton-miles - gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles. in 2023, gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles decreased 1% and 2%, respectively, compared to 2022, driven by a 1% decrease in carloadings. changes in commodity mix drove the variance in year-over-year decreases between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles, and carloads.
freight car velocity - freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network. the two key drivers of this metric are the speed of the train between terminals (average train speed) and the time a rail car spends at the terminals (average terminal dwell time). freight car velocity, average train speed, and average terminal dwell improved compared to 2022 as last year we experienced congestion across our system. these metrics were negatively impacted by operational challenges caused by weather in the first quarter of 2023 and train crew shortages in some locations in the first half of the year, but as network fluidity improved throughout 2023, freight car velocity increased sequentially.
locomotive productivity - locomotive productivity is gross ton-miles per average daily locomotive horsepower. locomotive productivity improved 3% in 2023 compared to 2022 driven by improved network fluidity in the second half of 2023. as a result of the improved fluidity, we stored locomotives in the second half of the year, reducing our active fleet size 11% since the end of the second quarter of 2023. these improvements more than offset increased average active fleet size in the first half of 2023 as resources were deployed to alleviate operational challenges and weather disruptions.
train length - train length is the average maximum train length on a route measured in feet. our train length increased slightly compared to 2022 as initiative to drive train length improvements in the second half of the year more than offset the declines in intermodal shipments, which generally move on longer trains.
car trip plan compliance - car trip plan compliance is the percentage of cars delivered on time in accordance with our original trip plan. our network trip plan compliance is broken into the intermodal and manifest/automotive products. intermodal car trip plan compliance and manifest/automotive car trip plan compliance improved in 2023 compared to 2022 driven by improved network fluidity, as evidenced by faster freight car velocity.
workforce productivity - workforce productivity is average daily car miles per employee. workforce productivity declined 3% in 2023 as average daily car miles decreased slightly and employees increased compared to 2022. the 3% increase in employee levels was driven by an increase in craft professionals as we aggressively hired train, engine, and yard employees to backfill attrition, cover absences resulting from recently negotiated sick leave benefits, and add employees in areas of critical need to address operational challenges and support our service product.
operating ratio - operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenues. our operating ratio of 62.3% deteriorated 2.2 points compared to 2022 driven by inflation, excess network costs, the ratification charge for a crew staffing agreement reached in the second quarter of 2023, increased casualty costs, and other cost increases, partially offset by core pricing gains, the 2022 one-time charge for the labor agreements reached with our labor unions, and the year-over-year lag impact from lower fuel prices.

roic is considered a non-gaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation s-k and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. in addition, we currently use roic as a performance criterion in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. roic should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with gaap. the most comparable gaap measure is return on average common shareholders' equity. the tables above provide a reconciliation from return on average common shareholders' equity to roic. at december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.6%, 3.3%, and 3.2%, respectively.

adjusted debt (total debt plus operating lease liabilities plus after-tax unfunded pension and opeb (other post retirement benefit) obligations) to adjusted ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and adjustments for other income and interest on present value of operating leases) is considered a non-gaap financial measure by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation s-k and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. we believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the company's ability to sustain given debt levels (including leases) with the cash generated from operations. in addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the company's credit rating. adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with gaap. the most comparable gaap measure is debt to net income ratio. the tables above provide reconciliations from net income to adjusted ebitda, debt to adjusted debt, and debt to net income to adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda. at december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.6%, 3.3%, and 3.2%, respectively. pension and opeb were funded at december 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.
liquidity and capital resources we are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. we analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the impact on our ability to generate cash. these analyses inform our liquidity plans and activities outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes.
at both december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had a working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturities. it is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit, and we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. we generate strong cash from operations and also maintain adequate resources, including our credit facility and, when necessary, access the capital markets to meet foreseeable cash requirements.
during 2023, we generated $8.4 billion of cash provided by operating activities, issued $1.0 billion of long-term debt, paid $3.2 billion in dividends, and repurchased shares totaling $0.7 billion. we have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants.
our principal sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents, our receivables facility, our revolving credit facility, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. on december 31, 2023, we had $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion of committed credit available under our revolving credit facility, and up to $800 million undrawn on the receivables facility. as of december 31, 2023, none of the revolving credit facility was drawn, and we did not draw on our revolving credit facility at any time during 2023. our access to the receivables facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. if our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financing is dependent on market conditions. deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all the following sources or activities: (a) increasing the utilization of our receivables facility, (b) issuing commercial paper, (c) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. the company's $2.0 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short-term needs. the company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.
as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in item 1a of part ii of this report), as of the date of this filing, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. in addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are like those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.
the following table identifies material obligations as of december 31, 2023:
operating leases [c]                       1,768               361                 375                 296                 237                   199                 300

[a]   excludes finance lease obligations of $158 million as well as unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs of ($1,732) million. includes an interest component of $26,363 million.
[b]   purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for ties, ballast, and rail; and agreements to purchase other goods and services.
[c]   includes leases for locomotives, freight cars, other equipment, and real estate. includes an interest component of $168 million.
[d]   includes estimated other post retirement, medical, and life insurance payments, and payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years.
[e]   represents total obligations, including interest component of $15 million.
cash provided by operating activities                                 $8,379                 $9,362                 $9,032
net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash                $87                     $4                  $(835   )
operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to a decrease in net income and $454 million of payments related to the 2022 one-time charge for agreements reached with our labor unions and the ratification charge for a crew staffing agreement reached in the second quarter of 2023.
cash flow conversion is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in capital investments as a ratio of net income. cash flow conversion rate is not considered a financial measure under gaap by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation s-k and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. we believe cash flow conversion rate is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing. cash flow conversion rate should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (gaap measure) to cash flow conversion rate (non-gaap measure):
cash provided by operating activities             $8,379                 $9,362                 $9,032
cash used in capital investments                  (3,606   )             (3,620   )             (2,936   )
the following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended december 31:
line expansion and other capacity projects               239               276               284
total capacity and commercial facilities                 664               584               527

[b]   locomotives and freight cars include early lease buyouts of $57 million, $70 million, and $34 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.
capital plan - in 2024, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.4 billion, down 8% from 2023. we plan to continue to make investments to support our growth strategy, harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. in addition, the plan includes investments in growth-related projects to drive more carloads to the network, certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from new and existing intermodal customers, continued modernization of our locomotive fleet, and projects intended to improve operational efficiency. the capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments.
financing activities cash used in financing activities decreased in 2023 compared to 2022 driven by a decrease in share repurchases, partially offset by less debt issued.
see note 14 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8, for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings, and note 18 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8, for a description of our share repurchase programs.
other matters inflation - for capital-intensive companies, inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for long-lived assets. as a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.
sensitivity analyses - the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest and tax rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.
market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31, 2023, and totals an increase of approximately $3.6 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31, 2023. we estimated the fair values of our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates.
tax rates - our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on current tax law. future tax legislation, such as a change in the federal corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. for example, a future, permanent 1% increase in our federal income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $525 million. similarly, a future, permanent 1% decrease in our federal income tax rate would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately $525 million.
accounting pronouncements - see note 3 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8.
asserted and unasserted claims - see note 17 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8.
indemnities - see note 17 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8.
climate change - climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance (see risk factors under item 1a of this report). we utilize climate scenario analyses to better understand climate-related risks and opportunities the company may face in the future under a range of potential scenarios. we continue to refine our approach to understand climate-related risks and are taking an iterative approach in our business planning processes as risk factors, solutions, and technology develop. however, we are unable to predict the likelihood, manner, severity, or ultimate financial impact of actual future incidents as climate scenario analysis considers a range of potential outcomes.
we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce our operational impact on the environment, including improving our operational fluidity to increase fuel efficiency, modernizing locomotives for improved reliability and fuel consumption, using renewable fuels, and exploring and testing low- and zero-emissions propulsion technologies. these initiatives are aligned with our safety + service & operational excellence = growth strategy. (see further discussion in "sustainable future" in the operations section in item 1 of this report.)
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. the following critical accounting estimates are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 2 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8. these critical accounting estimates affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. if these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
personal injury - see note 17 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8, and "we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures" in the risk factors, item 1a.
our personal injury liability is subject to uncertainty due to unasserted claims, timing and outcome of claims, and evolving trends in litigation. there were no material changes to the assumptions used in the latest actuarial analysis.
environmental costs - see note 17 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8; "we are subject to significant environmental laws and regulations" in the risk factors, item 1a; and environmental matters in the legal proceedings, item 3.
our environmental liability is subject to several factors such as type of remediation, nature and volume of contaminate, number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, as well as uncertainty due to unknown alleged contamination, evolving trends in remediation techniques and final remedies, and changes in laws and regulations.
our environmental liability balance and site activity was as follows:
property and depreciation - see note 11 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8.
assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property.
estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use, technology, asset strategies, and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets. we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets. actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates, which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods.
changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods' depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $71 million. if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $76 million. we are projecting an increase in our depreciation expense of approximately 3% to 4% in 2024 versus 2023. this is driven by an increase in our projected depreciable asset base.
during the last three fiscal years, no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties.
pension plans - see note 5 to the financial statements and supplementary data, item 8.
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rates and expected rate of return on pension assets.
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors:
●   we measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic pension benefit/cost by using individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. discount rates are based on a mercer yield curve of high-quality corporate bonds (rated aa by a recognized rating agency).
●   expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into consideration current and expected market conditions.
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension benefit/cost for 2024 and the estimated impact on 2024 net periodic pension benefit/cost relative to a change in those assumptions:
discount rate for benefit obligations                  5.00   %
discount rate for interest on benefit obligations      4.90   %
discount rate for service cost                         5.05   %
discount rate for interest on service cost             5.02   %
the following table presents the net periodic pension benefit/cost for the years ended december 31:
net periodic pension (benefit)/cost       $(7       )       $-             $9         $85

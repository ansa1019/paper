item 1a. risk factors our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate. the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10-k. the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time, and any of these risks may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or reputation.
failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences our business is subject to a wide range of complex u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations described in the "industry regulation" section in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.
in addition, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. for example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and, thereby, adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities. changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income. changes in laws that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business. health care reform under the affordable care act, related state laws, and the regulations thereunder, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act, have the potential to further impact the health insurance market for our peo business and the demand for our health care compliance solutions. we are unable to determine the additional impact that any of this will have on our peo business, our ability to attract and retain peo clients or demand for our health care compliance solutions.
failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could materially adversely impact our business. we operate our business around the world, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act. such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the u.s. treasury department's office of foreign assets control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others. in addition, some of our businesses and entities in the u.s. and a number of other countries in which we operate are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including, for example, the bank secrecy act of 1970, as amended by the usa patriot act of 2000 (the "bsa"). among other things, the bsa requires certain financial institutions, including banks and money services businesses (such as national trust banks and providers of prepaid access like us), to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. we have registered our payroll card business, as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to applicable regulation, and our adp trust bank with the treasury department's financial crimes enforcement network (fincen).
we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and we are continuously in the process of reviewing, upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures. however, there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators. any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. further, bank regulators, including the occ which regulates the adp trust bank, are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations, and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses, as a class, to be higher risk customers for money laundering. as a result, our banking partners that assist in processing our money movement transactions may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional material requirements on us. these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks' internal risk-based policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us, may require us to materially change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business, may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences the collection, storage, hosting, transfer, processing, disclosure, use, security and retention and destruction of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection and cyber security laws. these laws, which are not uniform, generally do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, storage, hosting, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, disclosure, use, security and retention and destruction of personal information; require notice to individuals of privacy practices; give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information; and regulate the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing. under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, clients, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries. the european union (the "eu") general data protection regulation (the "gdpr"), and the california consumer protection act (the "ccpa"), which became effective on january 1, 2020, are among the most comprehensive of these laws. as part of our overall data protection compliance program in connection with the gdpr, we implemented binding corporate rules ("bcrs") as both a data processor and data controller, which permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with eu data protection laws. complying with these laws and requirements, including the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr, our bcrs and the ccpa, may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. the future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability and damage our reputation. in addition, data security events and concerns about privacy abuses by other companies are changing consumer and social expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection. as a result, even the perception of noncompliance, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation.
our businesses collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure and retain and dispose of personal and business information, and collect, hold and transmit client funds, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, cause losses and materially adversely affect our results of operations in connection with our business, we collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure and retain and dispose of large amounts of personal and business information about our clients, employees of our clients, our vendors and our employees, contractors and temporary staff, including payroll information, health care information, personal and business financial data, social security numbers and their foreign equivalents, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive personal and business information. we also collect and transmit significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients to their employees, taxing authorities and others.
we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and client funds, and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes. nonetheless, the global environment grows increasingly hostile as attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. certain of these malicious parties may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources. although this is a global problem, it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent parties (including our personnel) may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure and retain and dispose of, and the client funds that we collect and transmit.
we have programs and processes in place to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures. hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties, or are required by third parties such as foreign governments to install on our systems, may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could (or, in respect of third party software, may be designed to) compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems. unauthorized parties also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our personnel, including phishing and other social engineering techniques whereby attackers use end-user behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into our systems. as these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. in addition, while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we may not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients, vendors or partners and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures. information obtained by malevolent parties resulting from successful attacks against our clients, vendors, partners or other third parties may, in turn, be used to attack our information technology systems.
any cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, theft of non-public or other sensitive information, or similar act by a malevolent party (including our personnel), or inadvertent acts or inactions by our vendors, partners or personnel, could result in the loss, disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information or the theft of client funds, and could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations or that of our clients, result in liability, litigation, regulatory investigations and sanctions or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients, or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider. as the global environment grows increasingly hostile, the security of our operating environment is ever more important to our clients and potential clients. as a result, the breach or perceived breach of our security systems could result in a loss of confidence by our clients or potential clients and cause them to choose another service provider, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data or cyber security incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, a data or cyber security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. while adp maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of data and cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of data and cyber risk.
our systems, applications, solutions and services may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions. we rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. we need to properly manage our systems, applications and solutions, and any upgrades, enhancements and expansions we may undertake from time to time, in order to ensure they properly support our businesses. if any of these systems, applications or solutions fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, whether due to malevolent acts, errors, defects or any other factor(s), we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. we have disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events. despite our preparations, our plans and procedures may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.
a disruption of the data centers or cloud-computing services that we utilize could have a materially adverse effect on our business we host our applications and serve our clients with data centers that we operate, and with data centers that are operated, and cloud-computing services that are provided, by third-party vendors. if any of these data centers or cloud-computing services fails, becomes disabled or is disrupted, even for a limited period of time, our businesses could be disrupted and we could suffer financial loss, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. in addition, our third-party vendors may cease providing data center facilities or cloud-computing services, elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations, which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition.
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could materially adversely affect our business and our brand our ability to compete and our success depend, in part, upon our intellectual property. we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, vendors, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. we may need to devote significant resources, including cybersecurity resources, to monitoring our intellectual property rights. in addition, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or ineffective, or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyber-attack or other wrongful conduct by third parties or our personnel. litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, which may be successful.
we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations there is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry. third parties, including our competitors, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our products or services and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. we may be found to be infringing upon such rights, even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights. any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us or if we decide to settle, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, obtain licenses, modify applications, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers, vendors or partners in connection with any such claim or litigation. even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming.
if we fail to upgrade, enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may materially diminish our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences. in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology, solutions and services. if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish. in addition, investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle. we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in product development. we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts before knowing to what extent our investments will result in products the market will accept. in addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to evaluate the new product offerings. furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our product development strategy, including because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing and technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion.
we may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives, and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and competitive position we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives, which are designed to streamline our organization, extend our world-class distribution and strengthen our talent and culture, while supporting our revenue growth, margin improvement and productivity. if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives, or if they are inadequate or ineffective, we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits, improvements may be delayed, not sustained or not realized and our business, operations and competitive position could be adversely affected. these initiatives, or our failure to successfully manage them, could result in unintended consequences or unforeseen costs, including distraction of our management and employees, attrition, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
a major natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or have other adverse consequences our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to capital markets and borrowing costs may be adversely affected by a major natural disaster or catastrophic event, including civil unrest, geopolitical instability, war, terrorist attack, or pandemics or other public health emergencies such as the recent covid-19 outbreak, and measures taken in response thereto.
the covid-19 outbreak has created, and such other events may create, significant volatility and uncertainty and economic and financial market disruption. the extent of any such impact depends on developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the duration and scope of the event; the governmental and business actions taken in response thereto; actions taken by the company in response thereto and the related costs; the impact on economic activity and employment levels; the effect on our clients, prospects, suppliers and partners; our ability to sell and provide our solutions and services, including due to travel restrictions, business and facility closures, and employee remote working arrangements; the ability of our clients or prospects to pay for our services and solutions; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. in addition, clients or prospects may delay decision making, demand pricing and other concessions, reduce the value or duration of their orders, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements. our business is also impacted by employment levels across our clients, as we have varied contracts throughout our business that blend base fees and per-employee fees. to date, the covid-19 outbreak has had a significant impact on our clients and, as a result, our revenue and new business bookings have been and, we expect, will continue to be negatively impacted. our bookings have also been adversely affected by the impact of the outbreak on the buying behavior of our clients and prospects, coupled with the inability of our sales force to engage with clients and prospects on an in-person basis and instead primarily leveraging virtual interactions.
political and economic factors may materially adversely affect our business and financial results trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility. when there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses. clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on hcm services or renegotiating their contracts with us, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.
we invest our funds held for clients in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. nevertheless, such investments are subject to general market, interest rate, credit and liquidity risks. these risks may be exacerbated, individually or together, during periods of unusual financial market volatility.
in addition, as part of our client funds investment strategy, we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. in order to satisfy these short-term funding requirements, we maintain access to various sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities, our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances. a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may increase our borrowing costs and/or require us to sell available-for-sale securities in our funds held for clients to satisfy our short-term funding requirements. when there is a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, the company may experience a decline in client fund obligations and may also sell available-for-sale securities in our funds held for clients in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client fund obligations. a sale of such available-for-sale securities may result in the recognition of losses and reduce the interest income earned on funds held for clients, either or both of which may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll, tax and other money movement services. while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures, a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll, tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.
we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders.
responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy, which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers, vendors, investors and other third parties. in addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.
change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us strong, investment-grade long-term debt ratings and high commercial paper ratings. failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain intra-day borrowing required by our employer services business, and adversely impact our results of operations.
we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients. competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and, if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel, results of our operations may suffer.

the following section discusses our year ended june 30, 2020 ("fiscal 2020"), as compared to year ended june 30, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"). a detailed review of our fiscal 2019 performance compared to our fiscal 2018 performance is set forth in part ii, item 7 of our form 10-k for the fiscal year ended june 30, 2019.
forward-looking statements this document and other written or oral statements made from time to time by adp may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. statements that are not historical in nature and which may be identified by the use of words like "expects," "assumes," "projects," "anticipates," "estimates," "we believe," "could" "is designed to" and other words of similar meaning, are forward-looking statements. these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions and depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements or that could contribute to such difference include: adp's success in obtaining, and retaining clients, and selling additional services to clients; the pricing of products and services; the success of our new solutions; compliance with existing or new legislation or regulations; changes in, or interpretations of, existing legislation or regulations; overall market, political and economic conditions, including interest rate and foreign currency trends; competitive conditions; our ability to maintain our current credit ratings and the impact on our funding costs and profitability; security or cyber breaches, fraudulent acts, and system interruptions and failures; employment and wage levels; changes in technology; availability of skilled technical associates; the impact of new acquisitions and divestitures; and the adequacy, effectiveness and success of our business transformation initiatives; and the impact of and uncertainties related to major natural disasters or catastrophic events, including the coronavirus ("covid-19") pandemic. adp disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. these risks and uncertainties, along with the risk factors discussed under "item 1a. risk factors," and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by adp, should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.
non-gaap financial measures in addition to our u.s. gaap results, we use adjusted results and other non-gaap metrics to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. adjusted ebit, adjusted ebit margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are all non-gaap financial measures. please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the "non-gaap financial measures" section for a discussion of why adp believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to their comparable gaap financial measures.
the global covid-19 pandemic has continued to evolve and our priority has been and continues to be the safety of our associates and the needs of our clients. in march 2020, we implemented our business continuity plan and took steps to shift over 98% of our workforce to work from home or off-site locations to ensure uninterrupted service to our clients across our solutions. while we are well-prepared to continue operating this way, we are in the early stages of bringing back a small portion of our workforce to the office on a volunteer-only basis. our sales force will continue to primarily engage with prospects and clients virtually; however, we are beginning to conduct face-to-face meetings in certain geographies to the extent our employees, clients, and prospects are ready to do so. we announced for our employees, excluding corporate officers, a one-time global associate assistance payment of $1,000 (or equivalent, based on the average wage parity in each country) in response to covid-19, totaling $50.4 million. we are also deeply embedded in our local communities and continue to support covid-19 relief efforts through financial donations and donations of medical supplies for hospital workers globally.
as a leading global provider of cloud-based human capital management ("hcm") technology solutions to employers around the world, we have continued to process payroll and tax obligations and provide other hcm services to our clients, despite the unexpected challenges that our clients and their employees around the world are facing. adp's efforts have been focused on providing information and tools to help clients understand and navigate the governmental relief that has been adopted globally. for example, the federal government in the united states enacted the families first coronavirus response act ("ffcra") and the coronavirus aid, relief, and economic security ("cares") act. adp has been working to provide support to all employers on the relief available under both laws. this includes an employer preparedness toolkit that helps explain the federal and state government relief, as well as a website dedicated to providing critical information about the small business administration paycheck protection program ("ppp"). during the second half of fiscal 2020, we rolled out a range of tools and reports to help our clients through the crisis and prepare for the recovery. we implemented over 1,000 feature changes to our products in response to 2,000 legislative updates in 60 countries, and we also had approximately 400,000 clients run over 2 million ppp reports for total loan values up to $115 billion dollars. many of those clients have also now run the necessary payroll reports to apply for their loans to be forgiven. as the global economy and landscape continues to evolve for our clients, whether due to legislative changes or other factors, adp is committed to supporting our clients to help them navigate these challenges.
the significant impact the covid-19 pandemic is having on our clients and the broader economy is in turn having an effect on our reported metrics. despite the fact that we have seen improvement as countries and states are in various stages of reopening and businesses gradually begin to bring a portion of their workers back, we've seen the impact on our full year fiscal 2020 results. employer services new business bookings was down 21% for fiscal 2020 as we saw bookings decline significantly and rapidly in mid-march due to the global social distancing guidelines coupled with the delayed decision making of our clients and prospects which continued into the fourth quarter. we also adjusted gross bookings as a result of client delays on implementation and the expectation that fewer client employees would come on board compared to when the business was originally signed. the peo average number of worksite employees increased 4% for fiscal 2020. our pays per control metric, which represents growth of the employee base for a large portion of our client base, showed a decline in the fourth quarter resulting in annual growth of negative 1.0% for fiscal 2020. in addition, we saw deterioration in employer services retention in fiscal 2020 of 20 basis points to 90.5% due to an increase in out-of-business losses.
while the challenges presented by covid-19 may affect the timing of our execution of parts of our strategy, we remain on a transformation journey, and our initiatives are yielding efficiencies and are focused on changing how we work. in fiscal 2020, we executed on our workforce optimization program and procurement transformation initiatives. for fiscal 2021, we are moving forward with a digital implementation and servicing initiative that leverages many of the capabilities we highlighted at our february 2020 innovation day. despite a challenging end to fiscal 2020, we continued to deliver profit growth during the year ended june 30, 2020. we will continue to monitor macro trends based on externally and internally available data and are using these indicators to drive real-time decisions as we remain committed to our long-term strategy.
we have a strong business model, a highly cash generative business with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients' hcm functions. we generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our reinvestments, our longer term strategy, and our commitments to shareholder friendly actions. we are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. our financial condition remains solid at june 30, 2020 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients.
results and analysis of consolidated operations total revenues for the year ended june 30, respectively:
growth:                          á            3%
revenues for fiscal 2020 increased due to new business started from new business bookings, partially offset by business losses. our revenue growth includes one percentage point of pressure from foreign currency. refer to "analysis of reportable segments" for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, employer services and professional employer organization ("peo") services.
total revenues in fiscal 2020 include interest on funds held for clients of $545.2 million, as compared to $561.9 million in fiscal 2019. the decrease in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the decrease in our average interest rate earned to 2.1% in fiscal 2020, as compared to 2.2% in fiscal 2019. the decrease is partially offset by an increase in our average client funds balances of 2.1% to $26.0 billion in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019.

n/m - not meaningful operating expenses increased as our peo services zero-margin benefits pass-through costs increased to $2,907.7 million from $2,647.5 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. additionally, operating expenses increased due to a change of $59.2 million in our estimated losses related to adp indemnity and a one-time global associate assistance payment in response to covid-19 ("associate assistance payment"). the increase was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency, reduced incentive compensation costs and reduced costs due to certain cost actions as a result of our transformation initiatives including procurement transformation initiatives in fiscal 2020.
systems development and programming costs increased for fiscal 2020 due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our products, partially offset by capitalization of costs related to our strategic projects, including our next gen platforms. depreciation and amortization expense increased related to the amortization of our acquisitions of intangibles and internally developed software.
selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for fiscal 2020 due to reduced incentive compensation costs, broad-based efficiencies as a result of our transformation initiatives including procurement transformation initiatives, a decrease in net charges related to our transformation initiatives, reduced facilities costs as a result of covid-19, and impact of foreign currency. the decrease was partially offset by increased selling expenses, an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of $26.0 million as a result of an increase in estimated credit losses related to the impact of covid-19 on our clients ("increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts"), severance cost as a result of covid-19 of $25.4 million, a legal settlement accrual of $25.0 million, and an associate assistance payment.

overall margin increased in fiscal 2020 as a result of our continued successful execution of our broad-based transformation initiatives including our procurement transformation initiatives as well as operating efficiencies. in addition, our margin improvement was aided by reduced incentive compensation costs, lower transformation initiative related charges of $60.9 million, and reduced facilities costs as result of covid-19. these were partially offset by incremental pressure from growth in our zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, an increase in selling expenses, an increase in amortization expense, a change in our estimated losses related to adp indemnity, an associate assistance payment, an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, severance costs as a result of covid-19, and a legal settlement accrual.

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 22.5% and 23.7%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, a reduction in the operating tax rate due to the mix between domestic and foreign earnings, the benefit of a foreign tax law change and lower reserves for uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2020 partially offset by favorable adjustments to prior year tax liabilities during fiscal 2019. refer to note 11, income taxes, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

earnings before income taxes peo services' earnings before income taxes decreased 2% in fiscal 2020 due to the increase in expenses partially offset by the increase in revenues discussed above. the increase in expenses was due to the increase in zero-margin benefits pass-through costs of $260.2 million described above and a change of $59.2 million in our estimated losses related to adp indemnity in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019.

adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. peo services has secured a workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of aig. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the peo segment. adp indemnity recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $20 million in fiscal 2020 and a pre-tax benefit of approximately $39 million in fiscal 2019, which were primarily a result of changes in our estimated actuarial losses. beginning in fiscal year 2013, adp indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ace american insurance company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of chubb limited, to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity during these policy years. each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. we believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. during fiscal 2020, adp indemnity paid a premium of $215 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with chubb limited to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2020 policy year to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees. adp indemnity paid a premium of $240 million in july 2020 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for fiscal 2021 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2020 reinsurance policy.

effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents                     (34.5)                            (28.8)              (5.7)
net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents                                          $257.4                            $254.1               $3.3
net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 include cash payments for reinsurance agreements of $215.0 million and $218.0 million, respectively, which represent the policy premium for the entire fiscal year. the increase in operating cash provided is primarily due to growth in our business supplemented by a growth in non-cash expenses within operating activities and net favorable change in the components of working capital as compared to fiscal 2019.
net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $5,256.9 million, proceeds from the sale of assets and lower payments related to acquisitions of business, partially offset by payments related to acquisitions of intangibles and payments related to capital expenditures in fiscal 2020.
net cash flows from financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $4,909.2 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, more cash returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and a net repayment of reverse repurchase agreements in fiscal 2020.
we purchased approximately 6.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $160.61 during fiscal 2020, as compared to purchases of 6.5 million shares at an average price per share of $143.02 during fiscal 2019. from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. the company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
capital resources and client fund obligations on july 15, 2020, the company gave notice to the current holders of our intention to redeem the $1.0 billion 2.25% senior notes due september 15, 2020 on the call date of august 15, 2020. it is the company's intent to issue new long-term notes to fund this redemption and which also may be used for general corporate purposes. if necessary in the interim, the company intends to issue commercial paper to fund the notes' redemption until such time as the new notes are issued.
we have $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025. we may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. however, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our notes.
our u.s. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. in june 2020, the company decreased its u.s. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $9.7 billion from $10.3 billion in aggregate maturity value. our commercial paper program is rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 ("p-1") by moody's. these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. at june 30, 2020 and 2019, we had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding. details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:
weighted average maturity (approximately in days)                       2 days                  2 days our u.s., canadian, and united kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2020 and 2019, the company had $13.6 million and $262.0 million, respectively, of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:
we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. we have a $3.2 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in june 2021 with a one year term-out option. in addition, we have a five-year $3.75 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.75 billion credit facility maturing in june 2023 and june 2024, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. we had no borrowings through june 30, 2020 under the credit facilities. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.7 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. see note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.
our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. we own aaa-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, equipment lease, and rate reduction receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. all collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected. in addition, we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks. our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. see note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.
capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 were $168.3 million, as compared to $162.7 million for fiscal 2019. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be between $175 million and $200 million.
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at june 30, 2020:
operating lease obligations (3)                   $105.5                     $168.8                   $100.5                      $96.8                  $-                           $471.6
tax benefits (5)
compensation and benefits (6)                      $34.0                      $63.3                    $59.2                     $308.4                  $27.7                        $492.6
(1)these amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt.
(2)during fiscal 2020, we entered into a series of treasury rate lock transactions with an aggregate notional amount totaling $400.0 million, to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates in anticipation of the refinancing of our fixed-rate notes due september 15, 2020. these amounts represent the aggregate fair value as of june 30, 2020, and is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
(3)included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases. we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment. the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
(4)purchase obligations are comprised of a $240 million reinsurance premium with chubb for the fiscal 2021 policy year, as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.
(5)based on current estimates, we expect to make cash payments up to $3.7 million in the next twelve months for obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits across various jurisdictions and tax periods. for $58.6 million of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments are expected to be paid.
(6)compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements.  these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $9.3 million in fiscal 2021.
in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. as of june 30, 2020, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2021, total $25,831.6 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. we had $26,708.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2020.
separately, adp indemnity paid a premium of $240 million in july 2020 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2021 policy year. at june 30, 2020, adp indemnity had total assets of $548.7 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $487.7 million for the policy years since july 1, 2003. adp indemnity paid claims of $4.4 million and $4.0 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. refer to the "analysis of reportable segments - peo services" above for additional information regarding adp indemnity.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  these assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. all of our long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). as part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. in circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client fund obligations. we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation. as a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. however, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.7 billion commercial paper program (rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and p-1 by moody's, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), and our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our $9.7 billion committed credit facilities. the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, including the covid-19 pandemic, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. in addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
we have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate, canadian government agency and canadian provincial bonds is bbb, for asset-backed securities is aaa, and for municipal bonds is a. the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb-rated securities is 5 years, for single a rated securities is 7 years, and for aa-rated and aaa-rated securities is 10 years. time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a-1 and/or p-1. money market funds must be rated aaa/aaa-mf.
average interest rates earned exclusive of realized as of june 30:
during the three months ended june 30, 2020, the company made a decision to sell certain available-for-sale securities in the funds held for clients as the company anticipated client fund obligations would decline due to reduction in employment levels from a slowdown in the economy as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. to maintain the size of the funds held for clients in line with client fund obligations, the company reduced its holdings of available-for-sale securities in the funds held for clients and sold approximately $1.6 billion of its available-for-sale securities.
we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio decreased from 2.2% for fiscal 2019 to 2.1% for fiscal 2020. a hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $17 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2021. a hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $8 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2021.
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  we limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily aaa-rated and aa- rated securities, as rated by moody's, standard & poor's, dbrs for canadian dollar denominated securities, and fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. approximately 79% of our available-for-sale securities held a aaa-rating or aa-rating at june 30, 2020. in addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than u.s. government and government agency, canadian government, and united kingdom government securities.
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 1, recently issued accounting pronouncements, of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other comprehensive income. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. in addition, as the duration and severity of covid-19 pandemic are uncertain, certain of our estimates could require further judgment or modification and therefore carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. as events continue to evolve, our estimates may change materially in future periods. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are revenue recognition (including deferred costs), goodwill and income taxes. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our policies for revenue recognition (including deferred costs), goodwill and income taxes.
goodwill.  goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired.
the company's annual goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30, 2020 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.  we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business.  significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates.  several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences.  as such, the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margins.  based upon the quantitative assessment, the company has concluded that goodwill is not impaired. as the assumptions used in the income approach and market approach can have a material impact on the fair value determinations, we performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values.

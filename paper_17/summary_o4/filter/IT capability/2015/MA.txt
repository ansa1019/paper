Regulatory and litigation developments across numerous jurisdictions have imposed evolving obligations and restrictions on our fees, products, operations and market participation, prompting us to devote substantial management and financial resources to defending our interchange fees, adapt our strategies with our customers, and assess potential impacts of new laws, regulations and litigation outcomes on our competitive position. Preferential or protective government actions in key markets have required us to re-evaluate our processing capabilities, work with domestic payment switches, and pursue changes or cooperation efforts in those countries, while heightened regulatory scrutiny and expanded oversight by central banks and competition authorities have compelled us to adjust our policies, negotiate new agreements and invest in compliance measures. Our rapid technological developments and the emergence of mobile, contactless and e-commerce solutions challenge our ability to foresee, develop, adopt and integrate new services, with our success dependent on anticipating and adapting to industry standards, intellectual property constraints and shifting customer and merchant needs. Information security failures, cyber-attacks and service disruptions are recognized as significant risks to our operations, so we maintain an information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage (each reviewed by our board of directors and audit committee), incorporate multiple layers of protection into our processing systems, test for vulnerabilities, and develop response strategies to preserve system integrity, operational continuity and the reliability of our branded products under adverse conditions. We rely on internal and third-party networks for global data transmission and recognize that infrastructure failures, natural disasters or third-party interruptions could degrade our services, harm our reputation and reduce transaction volumes, so we analyze risks, allocate resources for risk mitigation, and engage in continuous monitoring and improvement of our disaster-recovery and business-continuity plans. Our role as guarantor of settlement obligations exposes us to credit, liquidity and concentration risks, and although we believe our cash, cash equivalents, investment securities, cash-flow generation, borrowing capacity and access to capital are sufficient to meet our operating needs, guarantee requirements and future commitments, concurrent failures by key customers under extreme market conditions could exceed our resources and materially impact our business. Critical accounting judgments—such as those related to contingent liabilities, loss contingencies, deferred income taxes and valuation of acquisition-related assets—are made to anticipate potential financial exposures, ensure timely recognition of losses or recoveries, and preserve our financial resilience in response to evolving legal, regulatory, tax and economic environments.

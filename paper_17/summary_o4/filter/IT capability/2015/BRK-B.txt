Berkshire and its subsidiaries are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below, and additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions, and if for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations; however, Berkshire’s Board of Directors has identified certain current Berkshire subsidiary managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr. Buffett, has agreed on a replacement should one be needed, continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view in the future, and we believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. We need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders, and changes in demographics, training requirements and the unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact our operating subsidiaries’ ability to meet demands for goods and services; recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to all of our operations, and unpredictable increases in demand for goods and services may exacerbate the risk of not having sufficient numbers of trained personnel, which could have a negative impact on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. A significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against intruders and other operational difficulties; although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of assets or data corruption and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Through our subsidiaries, we engage in a number of diverse business activities, and our operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis, with essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses; our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the chief executive to head each of the operating businesses, and it also is responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance practices, including communicating the appropriate “tone at the top” messages to its employees and associates, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. At BNSF, system velocity and on-time performance improved significantly in 2015, reflecting capacity added through capital investments for line expansion, system improvement projects and additional equipment, other operational initiatives and more favorable winter weather conditions; in response to weakening customer demand in the latter half of 2015, employment levels were reduced. Our railroad, utilities and energy businesses require significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain their networks and systems so that transportation services and utility services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis and to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet customers’ needs and reliability criteria; disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of these businesses. The rates our regulated utilities charge customers for energy and services are based in large part on the costs of business operations, including a return on capital, and are subject to regulatory approval; to the extent these operations are not allowed to include such costs in approved rates, operating results will be adversely affected, and the laws and regulations affecting our utilities and energy businesses are complex, dynamic and subject to new interpretations or change, with failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation potentially having a significant adverse impact on our financial results.

In our 10-K, management discloses that intense competitive pressures and an inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could adversely affect prices, margins or demand for products and services, and that failure to timely and appropriately respond to these pressures—including maintaining customer service and customer relationships to deliver a superior customer experience—could negatively impact market share and financial performance. The company acknowledges the need to continually anticipate and adapt to evolving purchasing processes and has implemented programs such as BOSS, BOPIS, direct fulfillment and BODFS to enhance operational flexibility and meet customer needs, while recognizing that these initiatives may not succeed or achieve anticipated benefits. In response to cybersecurity adversity, management has implemented and regularly reviews enhanced encryption of payment card data, EMV chip card technology, and updated processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access, data loss and system compromise, although it concedes that failures of key information technology systems or processes—due to causes such as power outages, cyber-attacks, design or usage errors or catastrophic events—could significantly disrupt operations. The company continues to invest in supply chain and technology initiatives, including Project Sync and the COM platform, to streamline operations, reduce lead times, improve inventory turns and strengthen resilience in distribution and fulfillment. Management believes its cash position, access to long-term debt capital markets, cash flow from operations, commercial paper programs and alternative financing sources provide sufficient liquidity to complete capital expenditure programs, fund dividends, share repurchases and debt obligations, thereby underpinning business continuity. However, the firm also warns that uncertainty in the housing market, international operations challenges and supply chain disruptions—from political instability, natural disasters, supplier financial distress or logistics interruptions—pose risks to product availability, demand fulfillment and overall financial performance.

The Annual Report discloses that declines or disruptions in the travel industry—whether driven by sovereign‐debt crises, commodity price volatility, recessions, oil price shocks, stock market instability, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, droughts, volcanic eruptions), extreme weather events, pandemics and epidemics (including ebola, zika, influenza h1n1, avian bird flu, sars and mers)—can “dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services,” adversely impacting business continuity, financial results and operational performance.  To mitigate such risks, the Company maintains redundant systems and hosting services, employs encryption and authentication technologies, requires user authentication, and expends significant resources on security measures and phishing monitoring, yet acknowledges that its hardware and operations remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, power loss, telecommunications failures, sabotage, terrorism and cybersecurity attacks (including denial‐of‐service, sql injection and phishing), that it does not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to cover all losses, and that it lacks a fully formalized disaster recovery plan in every region, any of which could result in prolonged downtime, reputational damage, customer loss and legal liability.  The Report further notes that reliance on third‐party marketing affiliates, global distribution systems, reservation systems and payment processors—many under short‐notice terminable arrangements—creates dependencies that could complicate operational flexibility and risk management, that scaling technical infrastructure, personnel, procedures and internal controls across multiple jurisdictions places strain on organizational capabilities and resource allocation, and that compliance with evolving data protection and “cookie” laws, anti‐trust and competition regulations and complex tax regimes increases the complexity of governance and may constrain service continuity.  Finally, the Company highlights its use of short‐term derivative hedges to manage foreign‐currency translation risk and the maintenance of significant cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility to support liquidity and financial resilience for capital expenditures, share repurchases and potential acquisitions.

The board of directors has approved an enterprise risk management framework that incorporates the company’s purpose, vision and values to form the bedrock of its risk culture and set the tone for the organization, with risk appetite—defined as the amount of risk the company is willing to accept—set by executive management and approved by the board. Senior management has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring and controlling risks, overseen by a Global Risk Committee and its functional sub-committees (including Asset-Liability Management and Pricing, Operational Risk Oversight, Compliance Risk, Credit and Market Risk Oversight, and others) charged with establishing strategies, policies, limits and risk tolerance levels. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab maintains two data centers to improve recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency, maintains backup and recovery functions—including facilities for backup and communications—and conducts periodic testing of its disaster recovery plans as part of an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing and testing its technology systems. Operational risk—including inadequate or failed internal processes, human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, cyber attacks, system failures and natural disasters—is mitigated through internal controls, periodic risk self-assessments, internal audit reviews and vendor management, while compliance risk is managed through policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve and monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The company conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk under both expected and stressed scenarios, maintains high-quality liquid assets, and has access to committed and uncommitted credit facilities, a commercial paper program, Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank discount window arrangements, and other funding sources to ensure operational continuity despite disruptions in credit or capital markets. Capital adequacy is assessed via regular capital stress testing and monitored against internal targets—such as a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 6% at Charles Schwab Corporation and 6.25% at Schwab Bank—and regulatory requirements, with a capital contingency plan providing action plans for low-probability, high-impact events. Management limits growth in operating expenses (excluding interest rose only 4% in 2015 despite business growth), continually refines and tests its technology platforms, and maintains systems and procedures designed to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, demonstrating the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and maintain performance under challenging and turbulent market conditions.

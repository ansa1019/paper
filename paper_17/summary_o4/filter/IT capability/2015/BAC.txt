Bank of America’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K details an integrated risk framework and governance process designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by establishing clear risk appetites, centralized funding policies and delegated authorities for managing credit, market, liquidity, operational and reputational risks. The bank maintains significant global excess liquidity sources, diversified funding programs and contingency funding plans—including recovery and resolution strategies—to ensure uninterrupted access to cash and capital even during periods of market stress, deposit run-off or counterparty downgrades. Asset and liability management activities leverage derivative and securities hedges to mitigate interest rate, foreign exchange and mortgage servicing volatility, while independent risk management and corporate audit functions provide ongoing challenge and oversight. Front-line units embed risk-identification and control practices into their daily operations, supported by formal risk and control self-assessment processes, stress testing routines and business continuity arrangements. Operational resilience is further reinforced through backup systems, cybersecurity defenses, data-integrity controls and disaster recovery planning to address infrastructure outages, natural disasters, pandemics and other external shocks. Together, these measures align strategic, capital and financial operating plans with stress-tested projections, ensuring the organization’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger from adverse events.

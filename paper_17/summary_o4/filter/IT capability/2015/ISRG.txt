In its annual report, the Company describes its organizational resilience as rooted in its “learning process for surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products,” the diversification of revenue via fixed-rate service contracts and leasing programs designed to ensure business continuity, and proactive financial risk mitigation through foreign currency hedging and credit-risk monitoring. It acknowledges “economic uncertainty, disruptions in the financial credit markets, volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs, concerns about inflation, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns,” while noting that “if defects are discovered in our products, we may incur additional unforeseen costs, hospitals may not purchase our products and our reputation may suffer,” and that quality control and post-market corrective actions, including recalls and field corrections, are key to preserving system integrity and performance. The report highlights the challenge of supply-chain fragmentation from sole and single-source suppliers, the risk that natural disasters may disrupt operations given that “we do not have multiple-site capacity for all of our operations in the event of a business disruption,” and the need to manage regulatory variability through FDA and CE mark clearances, ongoing inspections, and adaptation to evolving healthcare reforms. It further outlines strategic initiatives such as collaborations, licensing arrangements, joint ventures and acquisitions to build internal knowledge, dynamic capabilities, and inter-organizational collaboration, investments in research and development to reconfigure trajectories toward future growth, and robust cybersecurity and legal contingency measures to confront unexpected situations, reconstitute resources, and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

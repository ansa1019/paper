The annual report highlights that “any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials,” noting that the company “relies on third‐party manufacturers” and its “supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi‐step international endeavor” over which it “does not have control.” To mitigate such risks, the company has adopted “a business continuity plan to deal with a disruption to our information technology systems” and acknowledges that “a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers … could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business.” It further describes a corporate compliance program “designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance” to address regulatory and legal pressures. In discussing its financial and operational flexibility, the company states that “our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on the extent to which we can increase our revenue and control our costs in order to, among other things, counter any unforeseen difficulties, complications or other unknown factors,” and that it “intends to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity,” supplemented by a “credit agreement” that imposes covenants to preserve financial resilience. The report also emphasizes organizational capacity in human resources, noting that “our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain the services of our key scientific and management personnel and to integrate new … personnel,” warning that “a failure to retain … could be disruptive,” and details extensive “contractual commitments and obligations” for leases, research and development, and capital expenditure to ensure operational continuity under varying future scenarios.

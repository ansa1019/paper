The company acknowledges that “rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years … has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure,” and that “if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected.” As such, it must “continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed” and “improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems,” since deficiencies in these systems “may result in disruption of our current operations and end-customer relationships, [and] our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses.” The company further discloses that its reliance on “sole limited sources of supply” and third-party contract manufacturers exposes it to supply shortages, pricing fluctuations, manufacturing delays and quality control problems, any of which “could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers,” lead to “lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins,” and could require redesigns or expansions of its supplier base that “may be extremely costly, time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully.” It warns that external pressures—including “economic uncertainty,” “currency exchange rate” fluctuations, changes in “regulatory requirements” for public companies, anti-corruption and import-export controls, “intense competition” and patent or copyright litigation—may “divert management’s attention and resources,” incur substantial expenses or require significant resource reallocation, thereby affecting business continuity. The company also notes its vulnerability to “product quality problems, defects, errors or vulnerabilities,” “long and unpredictable” sales cycles, “dependence on large end customers” and “concentrated customer bases,” which contribute to “significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations” in revenue. Finally, it highlights exposure to “earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events,” potential “breaches of our cybersecurity systems,” and manual, error-prone processes that could degrade its ability to deliver products and services, impair its financial reporting and compromise proprietary or customer data, underscoring the need for ongoing investment in research and development, disaster recovery planning and liquidity to sustain operational resilience.

Management believes that appropriate policies, processes and internal controls are in place to ensure the stability of its information technology environment, to secure systems access and maintain business continuity, but acknowledges that unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access could materially disrupt operations; although disaster recovery plans include backup facilities for primary data centers, systems are not fully redundant and disaster planning may not always be sufficient; should a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem—such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber-attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster—occur, operations will depend on the availability of personnel, office facilities and the proper functioning of computer, telecommunications and related systems, and the company could experience operational challenges requiring the allocation of resources to critical functions; the company continuously assesses and takes steps to improve its business continuity plans and key management succession, yet recognizes that a disaster on a significant scale or across regions, or its inability to successfully recover from such an event, could interrupt business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability; the business relies on critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings and its customers depend on the capacity, reliability and security of electronic delivery systems, websites and the Internet, all of which may be impaired by infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters or service outages at third-party providers, with delays, interruptions or security breaches potentially compromising information confidentiality and integrity, harming reputation, causing customer attrition and exposing the company to regulatory actions, litigation or financial losses; measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks and operational disruptions, including internal controls, employee training and disaster recovery protocols, can be costly and may be insufficient, circumvented or obsolete; reliance on third-party service providers for outsourced support functions, information-technology software licensing and maintenance introduces additional risks of service and processing disruptions, failure to achieve expected efficiencies and harm to employee morale; the company’s operations and infrastructure may be adversely impacted by human error, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, political unrest or war, and disaster recovery plans do not include restoration of non-essential services in all locations, which could impair the ability of personnel to service clients; the company cannot predict with certainty all adverse effects of its own or third-party failures to address and resolve system delays and interruptions; in the normal course, it faces litigation, government and regulatory proceedings and enforcement uncertainties, and it continuously reviews information to assess its ability to predict outcomes, which may require recording liabilities in future periods; strategic transactions and acquisitions present operational challenges, resource demands, integration issues, potential liabilities, regulatory and operating difficulties, retention risks for key personnel and possible diversion of management focus; and customer consolidation, market volatility, evolving regulations and competing technology-led business models constitute external pressures and hazards that require ongoing risk assessment, mitigation strategies and adaptive organizational capabilities to preserve business continuity and performance.

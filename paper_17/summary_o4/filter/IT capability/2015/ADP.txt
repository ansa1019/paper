ADP maintains disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect its businesses against a multitude of events including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events; despite these preparations, it acknowledges that its plans may not be successful in preventing service interruptions, disruptions to operations, or damage to its facilities. The company relies heavily on its payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems and hosts, collects, uses, transmits and stores large amounts of personal and business information, and while it devotes significant resources to safeguard and protect such information through programs to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents and regularly updates its systems and processes, it recognizes that evolving threat techniques and system defects could compromise system integrity or availability. To mitigate financial market and liquidity risks inherent in its client funds obligations, ADP invests client funds in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities with laddered maturities out to five and ten years, maintains a disciplined investment strategy focused on safety of principal, liquidity and diversification, and preserves access to committed financing through its U.S. commercial paper program, reverse repurchase agreements, and revolving credit facilities, thereby preserving functioning despite interest rate variability or market volatility. In its managementâ€™s discussion and analysis, the company highlights its ongoing investments in product innovation, strategic enhancements to its cloud-based HCM solutions, scaling of HR business process outsourcing platforms and processes, and development of its salesforce and human capital to respond effectively to changing client needs, regulatory pressures and economic fluctuations, sustain service excellence, and emerge stronger from disruptive change.

The report describes a wide array of organizational resilience–related practices and risks, including the development and continual enhancement of business continuity and crisis-management capabilities to address system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches in our global information systems, backed by an information risk management program whose cross-functional committee presents analyses of emerging risks and mitigation plans to senior management and the audit committee.  It outlines our formal water stewardship and risk management program—comprising water-use efficiency improvements, wastewater treatment, source-water assessments and replenishment commitments—together with collaborative policy and community initiatives to safeguard water availability and quality under conditions of scarcity and climate-driven variability.  The company’s productivity and reinvestment program, now extended through 2019, seeks to optimize global supply chains, standardize IT systems, streamline operating structures and reallocate resources from back-office expenses to consumer-facing marketing and innovation, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and cost resilience.  We continue to strengthen franchise leadership by aligning incentives, sharing best practices with bottling partners and refining go-to-market models to sustain channel performance under competitive and macroeconomic pressures.  Our rigorous product safety and quality management system—including integrated standards, laboratory testing, supplier due diligence and continuous improvement mechanisms—serves to mitigate quality failures and maintain consumer trust during product expansions and brand extensions.  A comprehensive legal and tax risk framework, from establishing litigation reserves to evaluating uncertain tax positions and hedging currency and commodity exposures, supports our ability to absorb financial shocks from volatility in exchange rates, interest rates, raw-material prices and regulatory changes.  In addressing evolving consumer preferences, public-health concerns such as obesity and ingredient debates, we have introduced reduced- and no-calorie options, transparent labeling and responsible marketing policies, while mobilizing community engagement to anticipate and adapt to disruptive shifts in dietary guidelines.  Finally, strategic refranchising of bottling territories, integration of acquired operations and long-term capital planning—including debt and pension funding—reflect our capacity to reconfigure our organizational structure, reallocate resources and preserve performance under extreme conditions, unexpected events or environmental perturbations.

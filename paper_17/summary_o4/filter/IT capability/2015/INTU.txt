The annual report discloses that “we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities,” warning that “in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities, which may cause us to lose customers and may materially harm our reputation and our operating results,” and that “any prolonged interruptions at any time may result in lost customers, additional refunds of customer charges, negative publicity and increased operating costs.” It describes the firm’s efforts to bolster continuity by “migrat[ing] our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and to third party hosted environments,” while cautioning that “if we do not execute the transition to these new environments in an effective manner, we may experience unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs.” The company acknowledges its exposure to “natural disasters, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control” and that “we host, collect, use and retain sensitive and personal customer information and data” which “could materially disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, significantly damage our reputation and cause material losses” if its security measures “cannot provide absolute security.” The report further notes that “we and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect this information and data” but that “unauthorized users who have fraudulently obtained our customers' personal information” may circumvent controls, and that “technologies, systems, and networks … are likely to continue to be the target of … security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our customers’ sensitive and personal information and data, or otherwise disrupt our … business operations.” It emphasizes that “we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments” and warns that “unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages, disruption in our business operations, loss of revenue or damage to our reputation.” Finally, the report stresses that “future revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products, services and business models,” that “we expect to continue to invest significant resources in our product development, marketing and sales capabilities,” and that it “expects to continue to invest in security and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud,” reflecting the company’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning under pressure, and reconfigure its operations to maintain performance under challenging conditions.

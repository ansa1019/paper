Visa’s enterprise risk management and business continuity frameworks encompass detailed policies and procedures designed to comply with anti-money-laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-corruption, privacy, data use and security laws, and to manage settlement risk through global credit settlement policies and client collateral requirements. We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses arising from another client’s failure to fund obligations and acknowledge that concurrent settlement failures or systemic operational failures lasting more than a single day could exceed our available financial resources and impact our liquidity. We maintain diversified liquidity sources—including cash on hand, cash flow from operations, a commercial paper program, a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility and an available-for-sale investment portfolio subject to policies limiting credit exposure—to ensure sufficient funding for operations, capital investments and unexpected demands. Recognizing the centrality of our processing systems, we invest in technology assets, infrastructure and cyber-security measures; however, processing malfunctions, natural disasters, power losses, telecommunications disruptions, fraud, terrorism, climate-related events, cyberattacks or third-party service provider failures may disrupt or degrade our services, compromise data security and damage our reputation, any of which could materially harm our business and result in heightened regulatory scrutiny, new operational requirements and increased compliance costs. We also monitor and assess emerging technological, regulatory and competitive changes, acknowledging that our products and revenues could decline if we cannot adapt to rapid developments in mobile, e-commerce, tokenization, blockchain and related standards or comply with new laws and regulations. To sustain organizational effectiveness, we emphasize strategic agility—empowering and deploying management and operational resources with both global and local perspectives, fostering talent through succession planning, and supporting innovation and expansion in an increasingly dynamic and volatile environment. In addition, we assess contingent liabilities for legal, regulatory and tax proceedings by evaluating the probability and estimability of losses in consultation with counsel, recognizing that actual outcomes could differ materially from our estimates and adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and performance under challenging conditions akin to the maintenance of positive adjustment under adversity.

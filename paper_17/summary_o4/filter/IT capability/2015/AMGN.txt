The report identifies a broad spectrum of risk factors and corresponding mitigation measures intended to enable the company to maintain continuity of its operations and preserve organizational functioning under adverse conditions. It discloses forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions and notes that its business is subject to external pressures from pricing and reimbursement regimes, regulatory changes, competition, geopolitical events and credit market volatility. To address these challenges, the company has implemented transformation and process-improvement initiatives and a restructuring plan that include the consolidation of facilities, workforce reductions and the reallocation of resources to fund innovative pipelines, new product launches and geographic expansion, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and cost efficiency. Financial resilience is supported by a diversified capital structure, including foreign currency hedging arrangements, interest rate swap contracts, a commercial paper program and a revolving credit facility to offset exchange-rate and interest-rate fluctuations and ensure funding for working capital, dividends and share repurchases amid turbulent credit markets. Supply-chain resilience is discussed through its reliance on third-party suppliers—some single‐source—and on primary manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico and California and distribution centers in Louisville and Breda; the company acknowledges risks from natural disasters, security threats and Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis and describes contingency planning to mitigate shortages and preserve product supply. Regulatory and compliance resilience is reflected in its corporate integrity agreement with the OIG, robust pharmacovigilance and REMS programs designed to monitor and manage product safety post-approval, and ongoing adaptation to evolving regulatory expectations in multiple jurisdictions. The company also emphasizes its dependence on information technology systems and data security measures to protect critical infrastructure from cyber-attacks and unauthorized access, as well as its management of intellectual property, litigation and tax exposures through reserve assessments and dispute‐resolution mechanisms. Through these systemic strategies—spanning resource reconfiguration, risk assessment, financial hedging, supply-chain contingency planning, regulatory compliance and IT security—the company aims to absorb strain, preserve or improve performance under challenging conditions and sustain the integrity of its global operations.

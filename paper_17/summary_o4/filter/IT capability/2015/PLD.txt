In the 10-K, the company acknowledges that its operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect its business and financial condition, including unexpected internal or external disturbances such as social, political and economic risks of international operations, system failures or cyber security attacks and energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism or war. It describes the implementation of security measures, despite system redundancy and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for internal IT systems, and the annual evaluation of earthquake, flood, hurricane and terrorism insurance coverage, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, to mitigate adverse impacts from such hazards. The firm seeks to mitigate volatility in currencies and currency restrictions by borrowing in functional currencies and using derivative contracts, while acknowledging that hedging may not effectively limit exposure and that access to capital may be restricted. Through geographic diversification of its portfolio, market research and asset management capabilities, and by leveraging economies of scale from growth in assets under management, the company strives to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions, including raising rents, value creation from development, completing acquisitions, development stabilizations, contributions to co-investment ventures and dispositions to third parties. It maintains disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and risk management processes to prevent errors and ensure business continuity, evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows, capitalizes only identified incremental costs of development, renovation and leasing, and applies critical accounting judgments in consolidation, acquisitions, hedging, income taxes and impairment assessments. Regular same-store analyses eliminate the effects of portfolio composition changes, and the lease structures enable recovery of the majority of operating expenses, all of which support its ability to preserve performance and adapt its resource allocation, strategic initiatives and operational practices under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

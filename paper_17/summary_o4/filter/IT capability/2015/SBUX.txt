Starbucks’ disclosures reflect a multifaceted approach to preserving operational integrity and performance under pressure, including formalized disaster recovery and business continuity plans to maintain product availability and sales in the face of system failures or catastrophic events; significant capital investments in information security technologies, third-party services and personnel to anticipate and mitigate cyber-attack risks and prevent unauthorized access, theft or destruction of data; diversified sourcing and supply chain risk mitigation measures—such as price-to-be-fixed contracts, hedging strategies for coffee, dairy and energy commodities, and development of alternative suppliers—to absorb strain and reconstitute operations under external disruptions; operational flexibility through a mix of company-operated, licensed and joint venture models that balance local autonomy with consistent quality standards, supported by ongoing partner training and monitoring; strategic initiatives in digital innovation, mobile order and pay, and global store formats that enable resource reconfiguration, rapid adaptation and continued customer engagement; and disciplined market price risk management policies, quantitative risk limits and forward-starting interest rate and foreign exchange hedges to protect margins, ensure continuity of financing and sustain positive adjustment in a rapidly changing competitive environment.

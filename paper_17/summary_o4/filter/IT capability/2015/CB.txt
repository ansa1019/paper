The report acknowledges exposure to internal and external disturbances—including natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, terrorism, cyber-attacks, and pandemics—that are inherently unpredictable and could impair business continuity or financial condition, and describes an approach to preserve organizational resilience, defined as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, through disciplined underwriting processes, risk models, geographic diversification, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance with excess-of-loss coverage, per-occurrence limits, reinstatement premiums, and catastrophe programs, while also recognizing the limitations of these tactics and the need to adapt to evolving climate conditions, regulatory responses, and market developments. It maintains reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses based on actuarial estimates incorporating historical loss development, expected loss ratios, and adjustments for large losses or emerging trends to preserve system integrity and performance despite uncertainty, and employs scenario, stochastic, and predictive analytics to assist decision-making in underwriting, claims, reserving, and catastrophe risk, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and adaptability. To guard against operational disruptions, the Company implements administrative and technical controls, contingency plans, and security measures to ensure the integrity and availability of its information systems and core infrastructure—including defenses against unauthorized access, malware, catastrophic events, system failures, and third-party service interruptions—and uses cash pooling arrangements, credit facilities, and a diversified investment portfolio to manage liquidity under stress. It monitors counterparty credit risk through financial strength ratings, collateral requirements, and default analyses, and manages capital resources via disciplined capital management strategies, access to capital markets, and share repurchase and dividend programs, all of which support the ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under adversity, and maintain performance under pressure in a dynamic regulatory, political, and economic environment.

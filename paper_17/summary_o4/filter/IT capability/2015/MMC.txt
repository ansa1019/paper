The company discloses multiple policies, processes and resources that contribute to its organizational resilience, including its reliance on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information and its recognition that failure to implement, maintain and upgrade safeguards such as encryption, multi-factor authentication and timely security patches could materially disrupt operations in the face of cyber-attacks, malware or other security breaches. It acknowledges exposure to business continuity risks arising from local or regional disasters—such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, pandemics, terrorist attacks, security breaches, power or telecommunications failures—stating that continuity depends on the availability of personnel, office facilities and properly functioning systems and that its inability to successfully recover could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm and legal liability; accordingly, it regularly assesses and takes steps to improve its existing business continuity plans and key management succession. In its risk mitigation framework, the company describes establishing liabilities for errors and omissions and similar claims only when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, using case-level reviews by inside and outside counsel, internal actuarial analysis and periodic adjustments under FASB ASC 450-20. Through its Risk and Insurance Services segment, conducted through Marsh and Guy Carpenter, it provides risk management activities—including risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions—as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and modeling services, segregates fiduciary funds under regulatory requirements and notes that inadequate identification of weaknesses or delays in integrating acquired businesses’ information systems could increase its vulnerability to disruption. The company also manages its financial resilience by maintaining a $1.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility subject to leverage and coverage covenants, regularly repatriating non-U.S. earnings, executing strategic share repurchases, funding defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans in accordance with ERISA guidelines and foreign statutory requirements, negotiating deficit recovery plans with plan trustees, re-measuring assets and liabilities upon plan amendments, recognizing sensitivities to discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions, terminating its post-65 retiree medical reimbursement plan to realize a net credit, and making equity investments in firms such as Alexander Forbes and Benefitfocus, all of which reflect a multifaceted approach to preserving integrity and maintaining performance under internal and external pressures.

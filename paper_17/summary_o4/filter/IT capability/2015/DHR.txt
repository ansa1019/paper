The annual report on Form 10-K acknowledges that our business is subject to general and unexpected disruptions of expected business conditions, including market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, natural disasters, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, terrorism, fluctuations in interest rates and changes in laws or accounting rules, each of which may impair our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  We have pursued and will continue to pursue significant restructuring actions and productivity improvement initiatives to adjust our cost structure and improve operating efficiency; however, these actions reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases, and delays in implementing planned restructuring activities, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize.  Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of our products, software and services, typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results, and managementâ€™s monitoring of key competitors and customers helps gauge relative performance and guide future planning.  We recognize the risks that arise from sole or limited sources of supply, fluctuating commodity prices, credit risk concentrations, currency exchange rate movements, market volatility and information technology or other system disruptions, and have implemented risk mitigation strategies such as a mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, high-quality cash investments, commercial paper programs and credit facilities, system redundancy and disaster recovery planning, and insurance coverage, all of which are intended to preserve functioning and maintain continuity under internal or external pressure.  Financing activities are managed to ensure sufficient liquidity to support operating, investing and financing activities, including strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments and defined benefit pension funding, and our periodic goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and ongoing evaluation of contingent tax liabilities and insurance obligations further reflect our efforts to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance despite adversity.

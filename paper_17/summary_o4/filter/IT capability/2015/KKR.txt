Our 2015 Form 10-K underscores the firm’s focus on maintaining operational continuity and mitigating risk in the face of internal and external disruptions.  We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and data‐processing systems to support daily operations and recognize that any disabling event—a cyber‐security breach, systems failure, disruption to our New York City headquarters or third‐party vendor interruption—could cause significant financial loss, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.  We maintain business-continuation and disaster-recovery programs and carry insurance, but caution that these safeguards “may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm” from disasters or cyber attacks and “might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.”  We further attempt to mitigate known market risks through selective hedging strategies and diversification of a broad array of asset classes across geographies, yet acknowledge that “we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions,” and that “competitive” and “economic uncertainties” can impair our ability to preserve value or reconstitute performance when faced with volatility, liquidity constraints or adverse sovereign, regulatory or economic events.  These disclosures reflect an awareness of the firm’s need to anticipate and respond to crises, deploy resources flexibly in turbulent markets, reconfigure financing structures under stress, and preserve the integrity and functioning of our core systems and processes through crisis management, risk assessment and recovery planning.

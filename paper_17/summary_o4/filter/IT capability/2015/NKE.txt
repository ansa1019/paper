Nike’s disclosures describe a range of practices and resources aimed at preserving or improving functioning under internal and external variations, reflecting aspects of organizational resilience.  The company “makes substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price,” thereby minimizing inventory levels, purchasing costs, fill-time and the risk of non-delivery.  To mitigate foreign exchange risk, Nike operates a centrally managed foreign currency risk management program, in which “we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results,” taking advantage of “natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio” and utilizing forward contracts and options to defer currency impacts on reported results.  The company warns that “interruptions in data and information technology systems” or “if our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations,” thereby highlighting its dependence on IT resilience and continuity planning.  It acknowledges that “delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors … could adversely impact our financial performance,” and that while it “maintain[s] business interruption insurance, it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.”  Nike recognizes that “extreme weather conditions” in key locations and “natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis” as well as disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict “could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition,” underscoring its exposure to environmental perturbations.  The company also relies on a concentrated base of independent contract manufacturers and licensees, requiring them to “comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safety standards,” with significant non-compliance posing reputational and operational risk.  Finally, Nike reports continued investments in operational infrastructure—including digital capabilities, automation and supply chain initiatives—to reduce waste, increase speed to market and support retail and direct-to-consumer growth, thereby deploying resources and strategic tools to enhance adaptability, risk mitigation and business continuity under challenging or disruptive conditions.

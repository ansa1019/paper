The Company discloses that system security and data protection breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, pandemics and other man-made or environmental disruptions could harm operations, reduce revenue, increase expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations, reflecting its focus on risk mitigation and business continuity. NVIDIA relies on multiple third-party foundries, subcontractors and software tool providers for wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, packaging and product development, and maintains diversified supplier relationships, inventory, rebate and warranty allowances to absorb strain from component shortages, yield shortfalls, delays or prioritization of competitors’ orders, thereby preserving customer relationships and operational flexibility under unexpected conditions. The Company allocates significant resources to research and development and to transforming its business model—anticipating customer requirements and emerging industry trends across gaming, professional visualization, datacenter and automotive markets—to sustain innovation, adaptability and competitive advantage under external pressures. Strategic initiatives include maintaining high-grade, diversified portfolios of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, access to external financing, and a build-to-suit operating lease financing arrangement for its new headquarters, as well as proactive management of tax contingencies, litigation exposures and intellectual property protections, all aimed at ensuring liquidity, positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the partial maintenance of performance and integrity during nominal, extreme or exceptional events.

The firm maintains comprehensive resilience measures designed to ensure the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including business continuity plans and resiliency facilities at its primary and alternate locations so that operations can continue if key offices become inaccessible; a global core liquid assets framework that pre-funds anticipated cash and collateral outflows over a 30-day stress horizon and meets intraday liquidity needs; a detailed contingency funding plan with defined triggers, mitigants, action items and communication protocols to analyze and respond to perceived or actual liquidity stress; robust capital planning and stress testing processes incorporating internally developed severely adverse scenarios and the Federal Reserveâ€™s CCAR and DFAST requirements to ensure sufficient capital buffers during severe economic and market disruptions; recovery and resolution plans, including Single Point of Entry strategies, to facilitate an orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress; a global business resilience committee to oversee resilience initiatives and security measures; and a rigorous risk management framework with independent credit, market, liquidity and operational risk functions, extensive limit governance, regular scenario analyses and model validations, and ongoing investment in systems, controls, staff training and cyber-security, all of which collectively enable the firm to absorb strain, mitigate risk, reconfigure resources and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

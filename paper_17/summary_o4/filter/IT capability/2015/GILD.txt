The report underscores that the company faces a multitude of internal and external pressures that require it to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity, noting “a manifestation of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition” and that “it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors,” thus highlighting the need for positive adjustment under challenging conditions. It describes operational flexibility and resource allocation challenges arising from its “inability to accurately predict demand for our products, the uptake of new products or the timing of fluctuations in the inventories maintained by customers,” and warns that “adverse changes in economic conditions or other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories,” leading to mismatches between prescription demand and revenues. The disclosure also details the necessity of risk mitigation and business continuity measures in the event of “business disruptions from natural or man-made disasters,” given that its headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in a seismically active region, and emphasizes systemic resilience concerns in its reliance on complex supply chains—“suppliers of key components and materials must be named in the NDA or MAA,” and any interruption could “limit our ability to generate revenues.” The company further acknowledges environmental perturbations in the form of “global pricing pressure,” frequent legislative and regulatory changes, and reimbursement constraints that require ongoing strategic response, and recognizes the importance of maintaining operational continuity and organizational health through compliance with “extensive regulation by the FDA, the EMA and comparable regulatory agencies” and by managing credit risks in emerging markets and regions experiencing budgetary crises. Finally, it notes its dependence on information systems and data security to avert “service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack,” as well as the critical role of human capital—“our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel”—underscoring a multifaceted approach to resilience that spans risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, adaptation strategies and recovery mechanisms.

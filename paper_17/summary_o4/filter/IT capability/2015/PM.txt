The company maintains backup systems and business continuity plans to safeguard its information systems and data integrity, acknowledging that system failures or security breaches could disrupt operations, damage its reputation and incur significant remediation costs. It has undertaken organizational restructuring, including factory closures and related severance programs, to realign capacity and preserve operational efficiency in response to shifting market, regulatory and cost factors, recognizing the associated asset impairment and exit costs. The company employs forward-looking planning and prudent assumptions in its forecasts—such as adjusted diluted EPS measures that account for currency fluctuations, volume declines and other uncertainties—while cautioning that actual outcomes may differ materially. It monitors and prepares for potential disruptions to its supply chain, manufacturing and distribution networks arising from economic, political, regulatory or natural events and stands ready to address staffing and management challenges that could impair volumes, revenues and net earnings. The company also pursues strategic initiatives including product innovation aimed at reduced-risk technologies and seeks to strengthen its brand portfolio through selective acquisitions and partnerships, while recognizing the execution risks inherent in integrating such transactions and achieving anticipated efficiencies.

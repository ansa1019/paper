The company discloses that it “relies extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business,” and that “failure to adequately update our systems and disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations,” thereby underscoring its emphasis on resource allocation and operational flexibility to absorb strain. It further states that “we are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business,” noting that “the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process can mitigate this risk,” which indicates the organization’s strategic initiatives and change management capabilities in the face of disruptive events. Business continuity of its supply chain is addressed as “we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots,” and that while that process “is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members,” reflecting its need to maintain integrity and performance despite environmental perturbations. The firm highlights its agility in strategic response to market and economic shifts, affirming that “we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items,” as well as its resilience in financial and operational planning, stating that “management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.” In human capital management, the company acknowledges its ability to sustain organizational health and member loyalty by “investing significant resources in training and motivating [employees]” and maintaining compensation levels above industry averages to reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction. Supply chain resilience is addressed by noting the need to secure suitable merchandise, ensure vendor compliance with quality standards, and manage risks from labor disputes, natural disasters and regulatory changes, each underscoring the organization’s capacity to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow and flourish.

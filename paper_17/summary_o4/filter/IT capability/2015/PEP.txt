PepsiCo’s annual report describes resilience as a core element of its management and operations, from an integrated risk management framework—comprising board‐level oversight, a cross‐functional Enterprise Risk Committee and division‐ and country‐level risk committees—to proactive business continuity and emergency management processes designed to identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety and reputational risks. The company’s multi‐year productivity and global operating model initiatives—entailing automation of manufacturing, optimization of the supply chain, consolidation of facilities, simplified organizational structures and shared services—demonstrate its capacity to reconfigure resources, preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions and maintain performance under pressure. PepsiCo emphasizes its ability to anticipate and respond rapidly to consumer trend shifts and regulatory changes by reallocating resources to innovation, product and packaging development, and marketing programs, and by adjusting ingredient sourcing to address commodity volatility, supply shortages, climate‐ or water‐related disruptions and geopolitical instability. Its disclosures of cyber incident preparedness, crisis response protocols for natural disasters, pandemics, product recalls and infrastructure failures, and adaptation strategies for climate change and water scarcity further illustrate how the company absorbs strain, preserves system integrity and sustains competitive advantage despite internal or external disturbances. Finally, its talent sustainability efforts and disciplined capital allocation processes underpin organizational health, ensuring the maintenance of positive adjustment and the capacity to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

The Company continuously reassesses its strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment, recognizing that “variability in our customers’ business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results,” and that especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on future performance if industry changes are not accurately anticipated. To preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, the Company implements cost management programs aimed at aligning expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, maintains sufficient liquidity reserves and access to debt and equity markets to support ongoing operations and capital infrastructure, and hedges certain currency and interest-rate exposures to mitigate internal or external variations and disturbances. Even during periods of reduced revenues, the Company continues to invest in research and development and to maintain extensive worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive and sustain performance under pressure. The Company manages its expense levels based in part on expectations of future revenues, while acknowledging that fixed costs, timing of revenue recognition and disruptions to transportation, communication, information technology or supply chains due to strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, and natural or man-made disasters could impair business continuity. To address risks posed by reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers, the Company endeavors to establish alternative sources where feasible and secures performance terms in written contracts, thereby enhancing its ability to absorb strain and reconstitute critical operations following service interruptions. Warranty provisions are recorded when revenue is recognized, with actual parts and labor costs charged to established reserves, and the Company monitors information-systems security and emergency recovery processes to safeguard proprietary and confidential information and to preserve system integrity. Annual impairment reviews of long-lived assets and goodwill, based on discounted future cash-flow projections and qualitative assessments, further reflect a systemic perspective and dynamic risk-assessment framework that enables the organization to adapt to environmental perturbations, reconfigure assets when necessary, and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

We depend on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners and alliance partners to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize and sell our products, and the failure of any critical third party to meet its contractual, regulatory or other obligations, including adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results. Our information technology systems and infrastructure face risks of breakdown, invasion, corruption or interruption by authorized or unauthorized persons, and despite our investments in industry-appropriate protections, monitoring and incident response practices, there can be no assurance our efforts will prevent future breaches or business interruptions. Our product supply and patient access may be negatively affected by events such as product seizures, recalls or forced plant closures; non-compliance with good manufacturing practices; quality assurance or supply problems; construction or regulatory approval delays for new or expanded facilities; changes in distribution channel requirements; and disruptions in supply chain continuity from natural or man-made disasters. We have implemented governance processes in response to our SEC consent order and FCPA settlement – including formal review and certification of financial reporting, a business risk and disclosure group, procedures to limit and monitor sales to direct customers based on expected demand, escalation protocols for potential compliance exceptions and a two-year self-monitoring period – to maintain organizational integrity and operational continuity under challenging conditions. We employ derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency, interest rate and other exposures, continuously evaluate our capital structure to ensure efficient financing and maintain substantial cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held primarily offshore for reinvestment to support our mission under varying economic and tax regimes. We monitor end-user demand, direct customer inventory levels and third-party market data, and rely on a variety of estimation methods to manage wholesaler and distributor inventory on hand, ensuring alignment with expected demand and minimizing fragmentation and excess. Our strategic evolution to a specialty biopharmaceutical company reflects organizational agility and a systemic perspective, leveraging the reach and resources of a major pharmaceutical company alongside the entrepreneurial spirit of a biotech firm, with four strategic priorities—to drive business performance, maintain leadership in immuno-oncology, sustain a diversified portfolio and adhere to a disciplined capital allocation approach—supported by significant investments in a deep, innovative pipeline, evolving commercial models and biologics manufacturing capabilities, and a culture of continuous improvement to preserve functioning and strengthen resilience in the face of external pressures, regulatory changes and environmental perturbations.

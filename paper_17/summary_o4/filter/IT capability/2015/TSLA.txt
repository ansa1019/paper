The Company acknowledges that as it introduces new products and variants the complexity of its operations continues to grow, noting limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting and selling multiple vehicle models and variants and allocating resources across these activities; it has experienced unexpected delays when adding complexity to its production lines and warns that similar problems may occur in the future as it ramps production of Model X alongside Model S and new vehicles, and as it transitions to new manufacturing processes and facilities such as the Gigafactory. The Company recognizes that its ability to increase production and deliveries depends on maintaining quality standards, on its suppliers’ capacity and reliability, and on managing supply chain disruptions arising from business conditions, labor issues, geopolitical events, natural disasters or other unanticipated factors, and it continues to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints, to qualify alternate sources, to negotiate cost reductions, and to redesign components to mitigate single-source risks and cost volatility for critical materials such as lithium-ion cells. The Company emphasizes its commitment to remedying vehicle and software defects as rapidly as possible, to expanding and improving its information technology, data management and security systems against data breaches and cyber-attacks, and to enhancing its service infrastructure by opening new service centers, training technicians and expanding its Supercharger network to support operational continuity and customer needs. Recognizing volatility in market demand, geopolitical and regulatory environments, and its own cash flow requirements, the Company maintains customer deposits and defers revenue under resale value guarantee and leasing programs to manage liquidity, has established a $1 billion revolving credit facility, and monitors its financing agreements—including convertible notes and hedges—to ensure adequate funding for capital expenditures and growth initiatives; however, it cautions that inability to secure additional funding on favorable terms, to manage cost reductions, or to adapt its strategic and operational plans could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and prospects.

Lowe’s has developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect its business, supported by a risk management framework administered by its chief risk officer and including the development of risk mitigation controls and procedures for material risks. The company acknowledges the critical importance of adapting its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment—responding to changing customer shopping habits, demands and demographics—to preserve functioning under adversity and maintain business continuity. Its strategic initiatives to build an omni-channel sales and marketing presence require integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing, as well as the acquisition of new competencies by management, employees and contractors, thereby reflecting dynamic capabilities to reconfigure resources and improve performance when faced with disruptive change. Lowe’s investments in customer-facing technology systems, disaster recovery planning and information security measures are intended to protect sensitive customer, employee, vendor and company information, safeguard its reputation and ensure operational continuity in the face of cyber-attacks or system outages. Through collaboration among merchants, stores and its customer experience design team, Lowe’s has reconfigured store layouts and merchandising presentations to showcase the outdoor living and holiday décor experiences, illustrating its capacity to reconstitute trajectories of response in immediate reaction to market opportunities. Its relaunch of lowesforpros.com and enhancements to lowes.com demonstrate absorptive capacity for external knowledge and agile adaptation of service innovation to meet professional and consumer customer needs online and in-store. Efforts to drive productivity and profitability—optimizing payroll hours, refining advertising media allocation, expanding social media presence, reducing print advertising and leveraging scale to achieve cost savings on indirect spend—exemplify resourcefulness and financial resilience under pressure. The firm actively manages public image and reputation risks amplified by social media, maintains rigorous supplier and third-party service provider oversight to mitigate supply chain disruptions from political, economic, weather-related or logistical disturbances, and enforces controls over third-party installers to reduce operational and legal risks. Strategic transactions, including the planned acquisition of Rona, include structured integration of personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems and the enhancement of internal controls to sustain firm performance and strategic agility across an expanded geographic footprint. Self-insurance programs and extended protection plan reserves are evaluated and adjusted through actuarial assumptions to absorb financial strain, and long-lived asset impairment reviews employ discounted cash-flow analyses to ensure asset values reflect recoverability under evolving market conditions. Expansion into Canada and Mexico entails adaptation of store operations, merchandising, marketing and distribution functions to local regulatory, cultural and economic variances, reflecting a systemic perspective on resilience. Finally, Lowe’s unsecured revolving credit facility, ongoing access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets, share repurchase program and disciplined capital expenditure plans underpin its financial resilience and ability to deploy resources to maintain performance despite uncertainty in debt markets or credit ratings.

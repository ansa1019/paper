The 10-K discloses numerous strategies and processes that support organizational resilience, including forward-looking statements based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity, legal and regulatory risks such as the uncertain impact of U.S. healthcare reform legislation, potential product liability claims, intellectual property litigation and extensive governmental regulation that require risk mitigation measures and compliance to maintain business continuity under external disturbances. It employs self-insurance for product liability claims, records inventory reserves based on historical experience and expected future trends, and utilizes foreign currency hedges, including net investment hedges, to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. Operational flexibility and adaptability are demonstrated through capital allocation strategies funding acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases supplemented by debt financing, strong cash and credit facilities supporting short-term liquidity and unexpected cash requirements including recall-related payments. The company invests in IT system monitoring, employee training and security policies to address cybersecurity threats, maintains business continuity plans, and undertakes a major ERP implementation alongside integration of acquired businesses to reconfigure resources and operational practices. Financial resilience is further enhanced by non-GAAP measures excluding irregular items to reveal underlying trends, annual impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets via discounted cash flow analyses, and recording liabilities for probable losses from legal and tax contingencies. These strategic and operational measures—from risk assessment, resource deployment and emergency management to continuous improvement and adaptation to environmental perturbations—reflect the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, in line with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

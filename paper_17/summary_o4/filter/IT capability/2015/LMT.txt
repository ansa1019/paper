The annual report emphasizes the company’s efforts to “identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted,” reflecting ongoing risk assessment under external pressures such as constrained discretionary spending and potential contract terminations. It notes that its “diverse range of defense, homeland security and information technology products and services … makes it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect,” and observes that “changes in our business environment require us to be agile and evolve our business models, processes and products,” illustrating adaptability and operational flexibility. In funding contracts, the company explains that “we attempt to ensure that adequate funds are available by notifying the customer when its estimated costs … approach levels specified,” demonstrating proactive planning and resource allocation. Market fragmentation—large contracts being split into smaller, price-driven awards—has increased competitive pressures, and the firm underscores the need to “maintain strong customer relationships and provide superior performance, advanced technology solutions and service at an affordable cost and with the agility that our customers require.” Its international strategy—expanding “in-country presence and strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and local production joint technology offices”—reflects inter-organizational collaboration and a systemic perspective on resilience. Portfolio shaping through “acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities” and a strategic program realignment among business segments exemplify dynamic capabilities, resource reconfiguration and change management. The report also describes resilience in the face of cyber threats—“we routinely experience cybersecurity threats … and work cooperatively … to seek to minimize the impact”—underscoring collaborative resilience strategies. The planned separation and combination of the Information Systems & Global Solutions segment with Leidos in a “tax-efficient reverse Morris trust transaction” highlights strategic adaptation under market uncertainty. Workforce risks are addressed through knowledge management as the company states that “if we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees … and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge.” Financial resilience is pursued by maintaining “a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities,” utilizing capital expenditures “to support new and existing programs,” and issuing “commercial paper backed by our revolving credit facility to manage the timing of our cash flows.” Pension funding and benefit cost disclosures reveal scenario planning and sensitivity to “economic assumptions” that “may cause our future earnings and cash flow to fluctuate significantly,” while an “ongoing comprehensive sustainability program to reduce the effects of our operations on the environment” demonstrates resilience to environmental perturbations.

The report discloses that the company’s ability to maintain functionality and performance under adverse conditions depends on proceeding with and completing projects on schedule and within budget, warning that project delays, cost overruns or terminations could require delay or termination payments or write-offs of investments. It further acknowledges that the operation and maintenance of its electric generation, transmission, distribution and gas infrastructure facilities “are subject to many operational risks” which “could result in, among other things, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures, a failure to perform under applicable power sales agreements or other agreements and associated loss of revenues, and replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at higher prices.” The uncertainties and risks identified include “the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions and natural disasters,” performance below expected or contracted levels, equipment breakdowns, water resource limitations, fuel or supply interruptions, reliance on unproven technology, dependence on specific fuel sources, heightened competition and insufficient insurance or warranties, all of which could impair performance. The filing notes that severe weather and natural disasters can be “destructive and cause power outages and property damage, reduce revenue, affect the availability of fuel and water, and require nee and fpl to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power and to access available financing sources,” and that any “disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems … could prevent nee and fpl from operating their business in the normal course.” It also identifies “threats of terrorism and catastrophic events … as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities” that “could harm nee’s and fpl’s business, for example, by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power, natural gas or other energy-related commodities, by limiting their ability to bill customers and collect and process payments, and by delaying their development and construction of new generation, distribution or transmission facilities or capital improvements to existing facilities,” potentially resulting in revenue decreases, significant additional costs, fines, reputational damage and constraints on capital-raising. The company emphasizes reliance on insurance, letters of credit, surety bonds and indemnification arrangements to mitigate losses from storms, nuclear decommissioning and contract performance failures and cautions that volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and other commodities, reductions in market liquidity, credit and performance risks of customers and counterparties, and the potential ineffectiveness of hedging and trading procedures “may materially adversely affect nee’s and fpl’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.” In addition, the filing highlights the critical importance of maintaining access to credit and capital markets, preserving favorable credit ratings and liquidity to support working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, noting that “disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit markets … could increase nee’s and fpl’s cost of capital,” necessitate delays in financing or the issuance of shorter-term securities at unfavorable terms, constrain growth objectives and reduce financial flexibility. Finally, the report calls attention to the risks of workforce shortages, loss or retirement of key employees, labor strikes or stoppages, rising health care and pension costs, evolving regulatory and safety requirements (including nuclear reliability standards), unplanned maintenance or refueling outages, and potential decommissioning cost overruns, all of which the company must anticipate, absorb and adapt to in order to preserve system integrity and performance under challenging or exceptional conditions.

The company’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to preserving or improving functioning under internal or external disturbances, including investments in system redundancy and disaster recovery planning to address natural and man-made disasters, IT system failures, power disruptions, terrorism and other business interruptions; accruals for estimated cancellation fees, write-downs of inventory that has become obsolete or exceeded anticipated demand, and impairment reviews of long-lived assets—including manufacturing-process equipment held at suppliers’ facilities—whenever events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable; multi-year purchase commitments and component prepayments to secure supply in the face of volatile demand, single-source risks and rapid product transitions; reliance on outsourcing partners to lower operating costs while balancing reduced direct control and potential disruptions in production and logistics; use of derivative instruments, forward and option contracts, and currency swaps to hedge against foreign exchange and interest rate volatility and credit market tightening; significant ongoing investments in research and development to support timely product introductions and maintain competitive advantage; robust quality, warranty and service-support programs to manage defects, errors and reputational risks; comprehensive privacy, security and compliance frameworks to safeguard customer and partner data and mitigate cyber threats; and proactive management of legal contingencies, tax planning strategies, and capital return programs—all of which reflect a systemic perspective on risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, operational flexibility and strategic adaptation to ensure continuity, resilience and performance maintenance in challenging conditions.

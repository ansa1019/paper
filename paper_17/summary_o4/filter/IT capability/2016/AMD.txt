It is important to have reliable relationships with all of our third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand; we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected; if we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers; we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs; if we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results; we cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis; the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; our ability to take advantage of the opportunities within the areas of computing and graphics is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those areas; if we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning; we regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing; if we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive; many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control; if essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected; we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory; we rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business; our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs; our information technology systems, and those of third-party providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and computer system or network failures; if our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected; data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to our business and reputation; if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected; if we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us; these restructuring actions and any future restructuring actions could have an adverse impact on our business as a result of decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees; any transformation initiatives or future restructuring actions we undertake may fail to achieve the anticipated results and may materially adversely affect our business and financial results; on August 30, 2016, we entered into a sixth amendment to the wafer supply agreement, which provides a limited waiver and rights to contract with another wafer foundry with respect to certain products and gives us greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio; we entered into two joint ventures for assembly, test, mark and packaging services and for expansion into the server and workstation product market in China to strengthen our manufacturing and market access capabilities; during 2016, we continued to closely manage our operating expenses and improve our balance sheet by reducing our debt, extending our debt maturities, actively repurchasing debt and managing our secured revolving line of credit while increasing cash balances; we continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts; management evaluates inventory at each balance sheet date for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook and writes down inventory when deemed obsolete; we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis and monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, which may represent an indicator of impairment.

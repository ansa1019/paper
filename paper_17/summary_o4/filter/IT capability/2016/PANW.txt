The company’s risk disclosures emphasize that its operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that, if realized, could materially impair business performance and operating results, including rapid growth that places significant strain on management, operational, and financial resources and requires the continued improvement and expansion of information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and the ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner, with any failure to manage growth effectively potentially disrupting customer relationships or limiting deployments. The report highlights that operating results may vary significantly and be unpredictable due to factors outside management’s control—such as competitive pressures, supply chain interruptions, seasonality, macroeconomic instability, and geopolitical events—and that the company’s reliance on third-party manufacturers and channel partners, as well as its need to predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to evolving technological and market developments, all demand ongoing risk assessment, resource allocation, operational flexibility, and business continuity planning to preserve integrity and performance under varying conditions. It further notes that network or data security incidents, defects or errors in products, and evolving regulatory and compliance obligations may create system disruptions, liability, and reputational harm, requiring continual risk mitigation, error correction, and adaptive measures to prevent brittleness. The company also acknowledges that its growth strategy depends on attracting, integrating, training, and retaining qualified personnel, expanding international operations, and securing adequate financing to support continued investments; any inability to navigate these challenges could constrain its capacity to sustain performance, absorb internal and external disturbances, and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Finally, by monitoring deferred revenue, billings, cash flow from operations, and free cash flow—and by believing existing liquidity, supplemented by operating cash flows, will meet near-term needs—the company demonstrates a systemic approach to resource generation and deployment, ensuring resilience against financial perturbations and supporting its ability to maintain functioning and adapt under adversity.

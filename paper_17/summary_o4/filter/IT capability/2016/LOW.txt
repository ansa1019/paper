Lowe’s reports that it has developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect its business, and maintains a risk management framework administered by its chief financial officer which includes risk mitigation controls and procedures for material risks. The Company acknowledges that it may be unable to adapt its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address changing shopping habits, demands and demographics or realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives, and that failure to identify trends, adapt its business concept, and implement change, growth and productivity initiatives successfully could negatively affect customer relationships, demand, market share and results of operations. Lowe’s warns that its strategic initiatives focused on omni-channel sales and marketing presence require large, complex programs demanding integrated planning, initiative prioritization, program sequencing and new competencies, and that if it fails to deliver the capabilities required, or is unable to attract, retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel with the skills and capabilities needed to implement these transformational changes, it may be unable to realize the full benefits of its strategic initiatives and expand market access. The Company emphasizes ongoing vigilance and investment in information security and disaster recovery planning to protect sensitive customer, employee, vendor and company information from evolving cyber-attack threats and to preserve business continuity, noting that a breach or failure to comply with data protection regulations could have a material adverse effect on reputation, customer confidence and financial condition. The failure of key customer-facing technology systems—whether due to distributed denial of service, ransomware or other cyber-attacks—or disruption of its fulfillment network through vendor failure, trade policy changes, natural disasters, pandemics, port labor disputes, security breaches or logistical constraints could rapidly destroy the benefits of its omni-channel strategy, lead to out-of-stocks, increased delivery costs, lost sales and decreased customer confidence. Lowe’s highlights the critical importance of hiring, training, managing and retaining qualified sales associates, specialists and corporate support staff with expanded skill sets to deliver high-quality service and consistent customer experiences across home improvement projects, while acknowledging the risk posed by wage rates, competition for talent and potential collective bargaining. The Company also notes that its public image and reputation are vital organizational assets that, if damaged by negative incidents or adverse publicity amplified by social media, could erode trust, reduce demand, impact vendor relationships and impair its ability to recruit and retain employees. Strategic transactions such as the acquisition of Rona involve risks including integration of personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems, potential disruption of ongoing business and increased complexity in internal controls, and Lowe’s may not realize expected benefits, which could expose it to additional liabilities, goodwill impairment or increased leverage. The Company warns that failure to achieve high levels of product and service quality, effectively manage supplier relationships, or mitigate payments-related, compliance-related or off-balance sheet risks could result in legal, financial, reputational or operational setbacks. International expansion presents unique challenges—unfavorable political or economic factors, currency volatility, difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights, cultural differences and complex regulations—that could restrict profitability and impede growth. Lowe’s identifies its need to comply with a myriad of evolving laws and regulations in each jurisdiction, noting that non-compliance could lead to enforcement actions, fines, penalties and increased compliance costs. To support organizational resilience, Lowe’s intends to leverage cash flows from operations, short-term and long-term borrowing facilities, its amended and restated credit agreement, disciplined capital expenditure plans for existing stores, distribution facilities and technology, and share repurchase and dividend programs, while monitoring debt ratings and maintaining covenant compliance to ensure continuous access to capital markets without triggering early repayment. Through these risk management processes, strategic initiatives, resource investments and financial planning, Lowe’s seeks to maintain integrity, performance and positive adjustment under challenging conditions and to preserve functioning despite internal and external pressures.

To maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT systems and confidential information, we have implemented measures to prevent, respond to, and minimize system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks; however, these measures may not be successful and could result in material financial, legal, business, or reputational harm. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and record losses when fair value declines below carrying value; manage research and development spending across our portfolio so that delays or terminations in individual projects will not necessarily alter total R&D expense; and utilize third parties for product development, manufacturing and distribution while acknowledging that outsourcing risks—such as supplier underperformance, quality or regulatory compliance failures, natural disasters, or inability to obtain sole-source raw materials—could lead to product shortages. We face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating exchange rates and strive to maintain an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions, employing hedging and other risk management techniques, entering into forward or option contracts to offset currency fluctuations, and maintaining commercial paper programs to fund short-term borrowing needs. We establish sales rebate and discount accruals—including managed care, Medicare and Medicaid rebates—in the same period as related sales based on historical payment patterns and governmental budget revisions. Our self-insurance for product liability exposures, recognition of uncertain tax positions only when more likely than not to be sustained, and ongoing evaluation of pension and retiree health benefit assumptions form part of our comprehensive risk-management framework designed to preserve operational continuity, financial stability and resilience under adverse internal and external conditions.

Our disclosures describe a comprehensive set of practices and risk‐mitigation mechanisms that support our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external disturbances, whether nominal, extreme or exceptional, including our opportunistic buying strategy, lean inventory management and frequent inventory turns that require merchants to react to changing market opportunities and trends and to adjust resource deployment based on sales forecasts and customer demand; our systemic approach to business continuity and operational flexibility across our global operations through integrated information systems, disaster recovery planning, data security measures and cloud-enabled infrastructure designed to maintain system integrity and consistent performance despite cyber-attacks, system failures or catastrophic events; our ongoing reconfiguration of systems, processes and support resources—such as updating or replacing hardware, software and applications, converting to global platforms, centralizing support areas, integrating new service providers and assimilating acquired businesses—to sustain our strategic agility and maintain performance; our expansion into new geographic regions, product lines, channels and business formats, supported by structured resource allocation for real estate, administration, systems, merchandising, distribution and compliance, which together preserve organizational coherence and competitive advantage in evolving markets; our investments in human capital, including recruiting, training, compensation initiatives and wage enhancements for key associates, to foster organizational health and adaptability; our dynamic capabilities in forecasting, cost control and foreign currency hedging that enable us to adjust operational and financial plans in response to economic volatility, currency fluctuations, adverse weather, pandemics, geopolitical unrest or other external pressures; our rigorous risk assessment and self-insured casualty insurance program for hazard management; and our disciplined management of legal, tax and contractual contingencies through accruals for uncertain positions, thereby reinforcing our resilience, systemic perspective and capacity to respond effectively to disruptive events and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

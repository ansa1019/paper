The firm’s 2016 Form 10-K describes a comprehensive framework of policies, procedures and governance designed to preserve operations, capital and liquidity “under challenging conditions,” including the pre-funding of projected cash and collateral outflows with a portfolio of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash (global core liquid assets), long-dated and diversified secured and unsecured funding sources, and the execution of staggered maturities to mitigate refinancing risk. A formal contingency funding plan and frequent scenario analyses and stress tests—incorporating both firm-specific and market-wide shocks—ensure that management can rapidly calibrate responses, allocate resources and maintain continuity of critical services in the event of internal failures, extreme market volatility, ratings downgrades or broader economic stress. Subsidiary-level liquidity and capital buffers are maintained in accordance with regulatory requirements, recovery plans outline steps to conserve capital and liquidity in prolonged stress periods, and resolution plans set forth strategies for rapid, orderly restructuring under bankruptcy or resolution authority regimes. Risk is monitored daily through var, sensitivity analysis, credit exposure limits, collateralization and netting arrangements; operational risk is controlled via robust policies, self-assessments, incident reporting, system redundancy and independent internal audit; and model risk is managed through an annual review, validation process and independent controls. Board and senior management oversight, along with training and accountability programs, reinforce organizational adaptability, risk mitigation and the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functionality amid adverse conditions.

We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted, and accordingly we attempt to ensure that adequate funds are available by notifying the customer when its estimated costs, including those associated with a possible termination for convenience, approach levels specified as being allotted to its programs, reflecting proactive risk assessment and funding strategies to preserve operational continuity. We depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. government, recognize that appropriations may be constrained and at times may self-fund customer programs pending appropriations, demonstrating financial flexibility and contingency planning under uncertain conditions. Based upon our diverse range of defense, homeland security and IT products and services, we believe that this makes it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business, illustrating portfolio diversification to maintain functioning and performance despite adverse changes. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, it is critical we maintain strong customer relationships and seek to understand the priorities of their requirements in this price‚Äêcompetitive environment, and we continue to invest in technologies and in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed, reflecting ongoing learning, adaptability and human capital development. In an environment characterized by increasing complexity in global security and economic pressures, a significant component of our strategy is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices, demonstrating operational flexibility and continuous improvement. We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio by independent research and development and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities, selectively pursuing acquisitions that expand or complement our offerings and exploring divestitures of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy, signifying dynamic reconfiguration to absorb strain and preserve performance. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our IT infrastructure and other disruptions, and although we work cooperatively with customers, suppliers and partners to minimize impact and rely on safeguards put in place by these entities, we acknowledge that the evolving nature of these security threats means the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted, underscoring our commitment to continuously adapt our resilience strategies and inter-organizational collaboration in response to disruptive events.

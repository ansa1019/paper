Several disclosures address Nike’s capacity to maintain operations and performance amid adverse conditions, reflecting organizational resilience. The risk factors warn that “difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining Nike’s increasingly complex information systems and controls, including … demand and supply planning and inventory control,” and “interruptions in data and information technology systems” could disrupt business continuity, while the Company cautions that its distribution facilities “could be interrupted by … disasters such as earthquakes or fires,” prompting maintenance of “business interruption insurance” to guard against “extreme weather conditions and natural disasters” and other disruptions. To mitigate supply chain shocks, Nike “makes substantial use of its futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance … to minimize the amount of products held in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery,” and has adopted “faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight” in response to port congestion. Financial resilience is supported by hedging initiatives as the Company “may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results.” Strategic investments “in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market” and “infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations” illustrate proactive resource deployment and systemic capacity building. Acknowledging supply chain and compliance risks—such as the potential “failure of our contractors … to comply with … standards” leading to “product recalls”—Nike underscores supplier resilience and contingency. The criticality of digital platforms is highlighted as “any failure, inadequacy or interruption of [technology-based] systems” or inability “to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms” could materially harm direct-to-consumer performance, underscoring the need for digital continuity. Lastly, the firm recognizes that “slower consumer spending … order cancellations … and reduced orders” under adverse economic and competitive pressures require dynamic operational flexibility and risk mitigation strategies to preserve organizational integrity and functioning amid internal and external disturbances.

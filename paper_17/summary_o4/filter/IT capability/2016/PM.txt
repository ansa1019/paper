The Company acknowledges that achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions, and that actual results could vary materially from forward‐looking statements identified by words such as “strategy,” “anticipates,” “plans” and “goals,” underscoring the importance of scenario forecasting, risk assessment and proactive measures. It faces economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters, conflicts and civil unrest that could disrupt its supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities, result in loss of property or equipment critical to the business, and create staffing and management challenges that may reduce volumes, revenues and net earnings. To mitigate these risks, the Company has established high ethical standards, rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, though it acknowledges potential limitations in fully detecting all improper conduct. The Company uses information systems to manage business processes, collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally, and maintains backup systems and business continuity plans designed to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access, recognizing that system failures or security breaches could disrupt operations, result in litigation and regulatory action, damage its reputation and incur significant remediation costs. In response to changes in consumer preferences and economic downturns, the Company aims to anticipate and respond to new trends, develop new products and markets, broaden brand portfolios, improve productivity and ensure adequate production capacity, while acknowledging that down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulations limiting branding and product differentiation. The Company’s key strategic priorities include the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products (“RRPs”) that present less harm to adult smokers, supported by rigorous scientific studies to substantiate reduced exposure to harmful constituents and advocacy for science-based regulatory frameworks, thereby allocating resources toward innovation, future orientation and systemic adaptation. It must also adapt to significant governmental actions under the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, including outlet restrictions, advertising and packaging bans, performance standards for smoke constituents and expanded smoking prohibitions, which could commoditize tobacco products and increase compliance costs. The Company manages the disproportionate effects of excise and sales taxes, import duties and currency translation by adjusting pricing strategies, geographic mix and cost structures, and provides earnings guidance that, at prevailing exchange rates and excluding unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, share repurchases and unusual events, reflects net revenue growth targets and the need for prudent assumptions. Its ability to grow through acquisitions and strategic business relationships is subject to integration risks and efficiency challenges, while government-mandated pricing, production control programs and climate-driven agricultural variations require flexible resource reconfiguration and supply management. The Company is further exposed to currency exchange controls that may restrict dividend repatriation, subjecting it to local currency devaluation and business disruption. Finally, operating in markets where social acceptance of smoking is decreasing, the Company competes for global talent and must attract and retain skilled personnel to maintain organizational health, operational flexibility and future adaptability under varying internal or external pressures.

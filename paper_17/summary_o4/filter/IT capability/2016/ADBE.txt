Our risk factors emphasize that our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external variations may be impaired if we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements that meet customer requirements, fail to anticipate changing needs and emerging technological trends or adapt our products to new platforms, any of which could cause customer attrition, impede our growth and weaken our competitive position. We must commit significant resources and make long-term investments in intellectual property and core technologies before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect demand, and delays in development, marketing or launch of new offerings may materially harm our operations, performance or financial condition. Our reliance on strategic relationships, third-party hosting and content delivery services creates exposure to interruptions, security or privacy breaches, failures in data collection and potential termination of agreements, any of which could disrupt service delivery, damage our reputation and cause loss of customers and revenue. Maintaining the security of our products, systems and networks is a critical operational and financial priority, as security vulnerabilities, cyber-attacks or unauthorized disclosures could lead to interruptions, delays or cessation of service, prompt extraordinary responsive and preventative measures, reduce operating margins and require investments to reinforce our cyber-defenses and disaster recovery planning, which may not account for all eventualities. We face complex global risks—including economic, political and regulatory shifts, foreign currency fluctuations, evolving privacy and data protection laws, natural disasters, climate change, pandemics, terrorism and geopolitical instability—that affect our supply chain, facilities, network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and compliance with these changing requirements may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices. Successful organizational resilience further depends on our capacity to manage transitions to new business models and markets, integrate acquisitions without disrupting operations, retain key personnel and corporate culture, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, adapt our sales and distribution channels, and maintain effective governance, risk management and strategic agility to foresee, confront and recover from sudden disruptive change.

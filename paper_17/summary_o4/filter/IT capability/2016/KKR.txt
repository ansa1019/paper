While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful; difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital; any disaster or disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, including information systems failures, cybersecurity incidents or other emergencies, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption, and our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption; our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks, and any inability of these systems to accommodate growth, new products or regulatory changes may expose us to financial loss, liability, regulatory intervention or reputational damage; entering new lines of business, expanding into new strategies and geographies demands greater management attention and resource allocation to manage increasing complexity of operations, compliance requirements and organizational change processes, and if we are unable to efficiently integrate and manage such expansions or adapt to evolving laws, our operational flexibility and long- term performance under pressure may be impaired; our capital markets, credit and private equity businesses face volatility and systemic risk in stressed market environments and, while we employ hedging and other risk-management strategies to address changes in interest rates, currency rates, commodity prices and credit spreads, these strategies may limit our upside or prove ineffective; the failure to maintain the structure and tax attributes of our group partnerships or to manage international tax and regulatory regimes in a timely manner could threaten our system integrity and our ability to generate or deploy financial resources; and in the event our liquidity needs exceed available cash and financing sources, we could be forced to sell assets, reduce commitments or seek capital on unfavorable terms, any of which could erode our organizational resilience and our capacity to sustain performance through adverse conditions.

NVIDIA’s disclosures describe numerous policies and operational practices that collectively support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions and thus reflect elements of organizational resilience as defined by Vogus and Sutcliffe. The company emphasizes its need to “adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner” to meet the evolving needs of its markets and to develop innovative products, services and technologies, noting that failure to do so “will harm our business.” Its reliance on third‐party foundries, subcontractors and software development tools is acknowledged as a significant risk that “reduces our control over product quantity and quality” and may require “cooperat[ion] to resolve” manufacturing yield or capacity issues and “allocat[ion] of our available product supply among our customers and partners.” System security and data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and other disruptions “may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns,” and any such business disruptions—from natural disasters, pandemics or geopolitical events—“could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses,” requiring “substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.” The concentration of operations in certain geographies and dependencies on limited customer relationships further heighten the need for business continuity and operational flexibility. Inventory management is governed by forecasts of customer demand, and the company notes that “failure to estimate customer demand properly” can lead to excess or obsolete inventory or shortages that “could adversely affect our gross margins” and “impair order fulfillment,” demonstrating a systemic perspective on resource deployment and risk mitigation. The company also maintains allowances for doubtful accounts, accrues rebates and marketing development funds as revenue reductions, and recognizes liabilities for income tax contingencies, all of which reflect proactive risk assessment and financial resilience. NVIDIA manages liquidity through a diversified portfolio of high-grade cash equivalents and marketable securities, a $575 million revolving credit facility, and strategic capital return programs of share repurchases and dividends, ensuring ongoing access to financial resources. The build-to-suit operating lease financing arrangement for its new headquarters includes options to renew or purchase and limits the company’s guarantee to 87.5% of construction costs, illustrating strategic tools for mitigating long-term facility risks. Regular impairment testing of goodwill and marketable securities using discounted cash flow models and market comparables enables the company to monitor its capital structure under various scenarios. Collaborative initiatives and acquisitions in AI, autonomous vehicles, mapping platforms and cloud services demonstrate inter-organizational collaboration and systemic reconfiguration of capabilities, enhancing the company’s dynamic capabilities to respond to disruptive events, reconfigure trajectories toward future objectives and “emerge stronger from a challenging situation,” consistent with the multifaceted concept of resilience.

The Company’s risk disclosures and management’s discussion describe an integrated approach to absorb strain and sustain performance under challenging conditions by continuously monitoring fluctuations in demand, sales and implementation cycles, and customer spending plans; by maintaining appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers; and by realigning and dedicating resources—headcount, capital, and operational capacity—into priority growth areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next‐generation data center, cloud, and software. Management emphasizes operational flexibility and cost discipline through targeted restructuring actions, the ability to cancel or adjust purchase commitments, the use of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and allowances for credit losses, and the deferral and ratable recognition of revenue from multi‐element arrangements, subscriptions, and financed service contracts. The 10-K further details risk mitigation and business continuity measures to manage supply chain challenges, diversify component sourcing, hedge currency exposures, secure manufacturing and distribution capacity, and maintain liquidity via operating cash flow, cash equivalents, fixed-income investments, committed credit facilities, and disciplined capital allocation—including returning a portion of free cash flow to shareholders. Ongoing goodwill and intangible‐asset impairment testing, dynamic forecasting, contingency planning for natural disasters, cyber-security incidents, geopolitical and regulatory disruptions, and litigation exposures, as well as emergency management and disaster recovery processes, collectively reflect a systemic resilience strategy designed to preserve organizational integrity, enable rapid recovery, and transform in the face of internal and external disturbances.

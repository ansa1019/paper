AbbVie’s disclosures emphasize its systematic identification and management of risks that could materially disrupt operations, including complex, highly exacting manufacturing processes vulnerable to equipment malfunctions, raw-material constraints, regulatory delays, natural or man-made disasters and single-source supplier interruptions, for which the company maintains business interruption insurance and quality assurance procedures to preserve product continuity. The company records estimates for rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and product returns based on historical experience and channel inventory levels, monitors evolving government cost-containment and pricing pressures, and carries adequate reserves to mitigate financial strain. To support business continuity and financial flexibility, AbbVie utilizes a $3 billion revolving credit facility, issues commercial paper and a range of senior notes, maintains sufficient liquidity from operations and access to capital markets, and routinely evaluates covenant compliance, debt maturities and credit ratings to ensure resource availability under adverse conditions. AbbVie also allocates substantial resources to research and development, strategic licensing, acquisitions and integration of pipeline assets to adapt to competitive and regulatory disruptions, invests in information technology systems with ongoing security monitoring to guard against breaches or breakdowns, and closely assesses customer credit risk—particularly in government-funded health systems subject to economic volatility—to uphold its ability to absorb strain and sustain or improve performance despite internal or external disturbances.

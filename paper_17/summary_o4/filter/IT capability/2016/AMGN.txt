Amgen has undertaken comprehensive transformation and process‐improvement initiatives designed to establish a more agile and efficient operating model, reallocate resources toward innovative pipelines and growth opportunities, and achieve approximately $1.2 billion in savings to support future product launches and clinical programs. The company maintains a vertically integrated manufacturing and distribution network—with major facilities in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Ireland and Thousand Oaks—supplemented by qualified third‐party contract manufacturers and clinical investigators, to mitigate the impact of potential disruptions, limit supply constraints, and preserve continuity of operations under internal or external stresses. Its financial resilience is underpinned by a significant portfolio of liquid, investment‐grade securities managed for prudent liquidity and risk exposure, diversified access to commercial paper, revolving credit facilities and capital markets, and strategic use of interest‐rate and cross‐currency hedges to stabilize costs and earnings against market volatility. Amgen also invests continuously in information technology systems and cyber‐security measures to protect critical data and network‐connected control systems, while its robust risk management framework, compliance programs and quality controls are designed to address regulatory uncertainties, supplier risks and geopolitical challenges, thereby preserving the company’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt to changing conditions, and maintain core performance even in adverse or exceptional circumstances.

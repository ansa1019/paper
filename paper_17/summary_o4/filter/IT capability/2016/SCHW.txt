Charles Schwabâ€™s disclosures describe a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework approved by the board of directors and supported by executive management that defines risk appetite, establishes governance through a global risk committee and functional sub-committees, and assigns business and control units responsibility for identifying, measuring, and controlling credit, market, operational, liquidity, and compliance risks, all of which is designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. The company maintains systems and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, overseen by a disclosure committee and subject to routine testing, and relies on internal controls, model governance, and fiduciary procedures to mitigate the potential for errors, failures, or legal breaches. To minimize business interruptions and preserve integrity and performance during internal or external variations and disturbances, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure with geographically dispersed facilities, routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and information security monitoring against cyber attacks. It has established liquidity policies and contingency funding scenarios, conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity exposures, and maintains diversified funding sources, while capital management includes monthly capital planning and asset-liability management reviews, regular capital stress testing to explore rare and extreme events, and a capital contingency plan providing action plans for low probability/high impact capital events, together serving to restore financial health and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

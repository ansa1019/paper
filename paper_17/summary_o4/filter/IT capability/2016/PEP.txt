PepsiCo’s annual report describes a comprehensive risk management framework and related practices that support organizational resilience through structured identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of strategic, operational, financial, compliance and reputational risks.  In Item 1A and elsewhere, the company details its efforts to maintain business continuity and operational flexibility in the face of internal and external variations such as natural disasters, supply chain disruptions, health epidemics and cyber incidents by leveraging diversified sourcing strategies, disaster-recovery and backup plans for information systems, multi-geography manufacturing and distribution networks, and productivity initiatives that yielded over $1 billion in cost savings and streamlined processes.  Governance and oversight are coordinated across the board of directors, a cross-functional PepsiCo Risk Committee and division-level risk committees, all supported by internal audit and compliance functions, ensuring systematic risk assessment and resource allocation to strengthen crisis preparedness and recovery capabilities.  The report also highlights adaptive strategies for responding to shifting consumer preferences—ranging from health-and-wellness product innovation and sustainability commitments under the “Performance with Purpose” platform to investments in e-commerce and digital capabilities—as well as the integration of acquisitions and joint ventures to bolster competitive advantage, extend product pipelines and preserve organizational health under adverse market, regulatory and geopolitical conditions.  Climate-related risks such as water scarcity and greenhouse-gas regulation are addressed through environmental performance targets and efficiency programs that both reduce costs and reinforce long-term resilience, while shared-services and global operating model initiatives promote agility and reinforce the firm’s capacity to absorb shocks, reconfigure resources and maintain core functioning despite extreme or exceptional disruptions.

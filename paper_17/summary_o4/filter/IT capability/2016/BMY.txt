In October 2016, the Company announced an evolution to its operating model to drive continued success through more focused investments in key brands and markets, accelerating its pipeline with a more agile R&D organization, streamlining operations and realigning manufacturing capabilities for expanded biologics capacity, thereby enhancing strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in its highest priorities. The Company continuously evaluates its capital structure and maintains revolving credit facilities to ensure efficient financing and sufficient liquidity to support dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments and working capital requirements, believing its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with operational cash flows, are sufficient to meet its needs for the foreseeable future. The Company maintains business continuity programs in collaboration with its third‐party suppliers and vendors, requiring them to deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis and to resolve significant disagreements, and has established governance processes to monitor and escalate potential compliance issues, including under an SEC consent order limiting sales to direct customers based on expected demand. In the U.S. distribution channel, the Company employs inventory management agreements with its three largest wholesalers—accounting for approximately 95% of U.S. gross sales—and third‐party market research data to estimate product‐level inventory months on hand and extrapolates these estimates to other wholesalers; internationally, where direct customer data are more limited, it uses historical sales, shelf‐life considerations and market‐specific ordering patterns to estimate inventory and ensure appropriate supply levels. The Company has invested in industry-appropriate protections and ongoing monitoring practices for its IT systems to reduce cyber-risks, recognizing that a significant breakdown or breach could interrupt operations and harm its reputation. It also acknowledges that loss of key molecules and intermediates due to natural or man-made disasters or sabotage could disrupt the product development cycle and has integrated such scenarios into its supply chain risk management and emergency response planning. The Company manages environmental and geopolitical risks—including currency fluctuations, pension funding volatility and the potential effects of the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union—and believes these conditions will not materially impair its financial position, liquidity or consolidated results of operations. It employs detailed gross-to-net revenue adjustments—such as charge-backs, rebates, returns and discounts—based on contractual and legislative requirements, historical experience, payer mix and product life cycle, demonstrating adaptive pricing and inventory resilience. Finally, through a disciplined approach to capital allocation that includes strategic licensing, acquisitions, divestitures and collaborative partnerships, the Company sustains resource reconfiguration and organizational adaptability to preserve integrity and performance under internal or external variations or disruptions.

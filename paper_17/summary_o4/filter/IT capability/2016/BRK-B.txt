Berkshire and its subsidiaries employ comprehensive business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analyses to mitigate cyber security and other operational risks and maintain service integrity under adverse conditions. The board’s succession planning for key personnel, combined with an unusually decentralized governance model that empowers subsidiary managers to make underwriting, capital allocation and day-to-day operating decisions, enhances organizational flexibility and continuity. Our insurance operations utilize actuarial loss development techniques—such as incurred and paid bornhuetter-ferguson methods, expected loss ratios and case development analyses—to absorb claim-tail variability and preserve underwriting performance despite internal or external disturbances, while retroactive reinsurance contracts reconfigure exposures to latent asbestos, environmental and casualty liabilities. Investment policies prioritize safety over yield, maintaining ample liquidity in cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills to absorb market volatility without compromising financial condition. Operating businesses facing intense competitive, technological and regulatory pressures—exemplified by BNSF’s capacity adjustments, fuel-price-driven cost management and capital investments, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s implementation of mandated technologies and rate filings—adapt through strategic capital deployments and regulated rate mechanisms to sustain reliable service and financial performance. Manufacturing and service subsidiaries respond to demand shifts via cost containment initiatives, restructuring and selective acquisitions (including Precision Castparts and Duracell) to reconfigure resources and safeguard long-term growth. Finance and financial product units manage credit, delinquency and asset-valuation risks and monitor large customer exposures to preserve liquidity and solvency. A strong consolidated balance sheet, disciplined capital expenditure forecasts and a minimum liquidity threshold further reinforce our ability to maintain positive adjustment, operational continuity and competitive advantage under challenging and unforeseen conditions.

The 10-K discloses a range of organizational practices and strategic initiatives intended to enhance the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under adverse conditions.  In its risk factors, the company describes exposures to foreign currency fluctuations, exchange and pricing controls and localized volatility in some operating regions, and it notes the actions taken to manage such controls, maintain local operations and repatriate earnings.  Supply chain continuity is highlighted as a potential point of failure—from labor disputes, loss of manufacturing sites, raw‐material shortages, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism—and the company emphasizes its execution of supply chain simplifications, sole‐supplier arrangements and productivity and cost‐savings projects to preserve functioning under internal and external pressures.  Commodity price volatility is managed through pricing actions, cost‐saving projects and sourcing decisions, reflecting adaptive resource allocation and operational flexibility.  The report further acknowledges the potential impact of information security incidents or failures of key IT systems and describes investments in network monitoring, employee training, security policies and business continuity plans designed to recover critical operations and maintain system integrity.  Portfolio optimization efforts—divesting, discontinuing or consolidating non-strategic brands and managing acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures—are presented as means of reconfiguring resources toward core strengths and sustaining competitive advantage.  A multi-year productivity and cost-savings initiative is described as streamlining management decision making, restructuring organizational layers, optimizing manufacturing and reducing overhead to fund growth while maintaining agility.  The company also underscores the importance of talent retention, leadership succession and the development of organizational capabilities in key growth markets to ensure continuity of strategic initiatives.  Its global organizational structure—comprising global business units, selling and market operations and global business services—demonstrates a systemic perspective designed to coordinate resources across geographies, absorb external pressures and protect performance under market perturbations.  Liquidity-management strategies, including extended supplier payment terms and diversified debt facilities, illustrate risk mitigation measures to sustain cash flow under stress.  Compliance programs and adaptability to rapidly changing legal and regulatory environments further evidence mechanisms for resilience, as does specific mention of planning for potential trade, labor and legal disruptions arising from events such as Brexit.  Finally, the forward-looking statements and associated scenario analyses in the MD&A reflect the company’s recognition of economic, political and competitive uncertainties and its reliance on stress testing, flexible planning and resource reconfiguration to preserve organizational integrity and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

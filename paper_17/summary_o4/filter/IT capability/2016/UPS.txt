In the course of managing cyclical changes and external pressures beyond its control, the company has repeatedly adjusted its business model, air capacity and cost structure to better match prevailing volume levels, and has leveraged the flexibilities inherent in its broad portfolio of services and integrated transportation network to adapt to evolving economic and competitive landscapes. It has undertaken strategic initiatives to improve network flexibility and capacity, enhance yield management, and increase operational efficiency while containing costs, including the deployment of facility automation projects and the accelerated rollout of its on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“ORION”) to improve capacity, efficiency, flexibility and reliability. The firm monitors and manages its exposures to fuel price volatility, currency exchange rates and interest rate fluctuations, making use of derivative instruments to mitigate financial impacts, and maintains hybrid self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs for workers’ compensation, automotive liability, property damage, business interruption and other risks, supported by actuarially determined reserves that are continually reviewed. It commits significant capital to aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and sorting equipment to replace existing capacity and support anticipated growth, yet recognizes that forecasting projected volume under uncertainty may yield excess or insufficient capacity and has accordingly adjusted operational and cost structures in response to adverse conditions, even as such measures may not fully preserve margins in a weak economy. The company’s reliance on complex information technology networks to support critical business processes is underpinned by ongoing investments in data and system security, yet it acknowledges that failures, cyber-attacks or evolving security requirements could disrupt operations or harm its reputation. It maintains emergency management and business continuity planning to address severe weather, natural or manmade disasters, global terrorism threats and pandemic risks that could interrupt facility operations or supply chains. Compliance with stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor and trade regulations worldwide, including potential capital expenditures to meet new requirements, and the establishment of health and welfare benefit arrangements through multiemployer funds to contain postretirement healthcare and pension costs, further reflect its efforts to absorb strain, mitigate hazards and preserve or improve functioning under challenging, nominal or exceptional conditions.

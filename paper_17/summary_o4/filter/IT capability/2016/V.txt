Regulatory developments and evolving market conditions require us to adapt our policies and operational practices to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including maintaining sufficient capital and financial resources locally, while innovations in payment technology have broadened our product and service scope and expanded potential regulatory influence, necessitating continuous enhancement of our systems and compliance programs.  We rely on strategic collaboration with financial institution clients, acquirers, merchants and processors—through incentives, co-branding efforts and routing-preference discussions—to preserve transaction volumes, acceptance growth and competitive positioning under changing conditions.  Our treasury policies provide guidelines for managing liquidity risk via cash‐flow forecasting, settlement completion, collateral management and investment of excess cash in available-for-sale securities, and we supplement these measures with a commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and multi-year debt issuances to ensure timely access to funding.  We anticipate and manage resource deployment through long-term marketing and sponsorship commitments, operating leases, purchase agreements and client incentive contracts that are tied to performance metrics and can be adjusted based on actual outcomes.  Recognizing the threats of cyber-attacks, system errors, natural disasters and other disruptions, we devote significant resources to our information security and business continuity programs, with the aim of rapidly recovering critical functions, assets and data.  We continually invest in technology assets, payments-system infrastructure and digital solutions, reconfigure our systems in response to environmental disturbances, and enhance compliance and risk-management controls to sustain functioning, preserve performance under pressure and support future growth.

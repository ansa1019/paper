Marsh & McLennan’s Form 10-K articulates the company’s imperative to maintain operational continuity and preserve integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances by implementing, assessing and enhancing business continuity plans and key management succession protocols to respond to disasters or continuity events—such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terrorist attacks, pandemics, security breaches, cyber-attacks or system failures—and mitigate the risk of operational challenges, data loss, extended outages, reputational harm or legal liability. The filing acknowledges that its ability to operate depends on the continued availability of qualified personnel, office facilities and properly functioning information technology, telecommunications and related systems and warns that inadequate business disruption insurance, in conjunction with complex and growing infrastructure—including mobile technologies, cloud services, social media, Internet-connected devices and third-party vendors—heightens its vulnerability to advanced persistent threats and internal misuse, which could impede its recovery and service delivery. In addition, the Risk and Insurance Services segment describes its provision of risk management advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions and the regulated investment of fiduciary funds, reflecting a systemic, integrated approach to absorbing strain and preserving organizational functioning during challenging conditions.

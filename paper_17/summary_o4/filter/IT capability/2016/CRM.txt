The Company discloses that it has established disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements by replicating its production environment and all customer data in near real time at separate facilities, yet acknowledges it does not control these third-party sites and that they may be vulnerable to earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, sabotage, vandalism, legal or permitting changes or terrorist acts, any of which could cause lengthy service interruptions. It further warns that security breaches—whether through third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud-platform providers, partners or customer-authorized technology vendors—could expose proprietary and sensitive information, disrupt service delivery, erode customer confidence and subject the Company to significant legal and financial liabilities. The Company notes that defects or disruptions in its complex mix of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, unsuccessful data transfers when adding capacity or data centers, strains on data center capacity and fragmentation or outages in the underlying Internet infrastructure may degrade performance, trigger credits or penalties, drive customer attrition and impair new customer acquisition. It acknowledges that evolving domestic and foreign privacy and industry-specific regulations, including cross-border data transfer restrictions, may limit service adoption, impose burdensome compliance costs and require resource reallocation, which could restrict global growth and flexibility. The report highlights the operational strain posed by rapid expansion of its customer base and personnel, emphasizing that failure to scale internal infrastructure, increase data center capacity, maintain high-quality technical support and integrate acquired technologies to consistent quality and security standards could impede the execution of its strategic initiatives. Finally, the Company recognizes its exposure to natural disasters, pandemics and geopolitical developments, notes that its headquarters and critical operations are located in seismically active regions without earthquake insurance and affirms that, despite crisis management and disaster response plans, extreme events could materially impair financial condition and operating results.

Consistent with the concept of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, the Company discloses that exposure to litigation, government investigations or regulatory proceedings may impose additional expenses and divert senior management’s attention from core operations, undermining business continuity; that disruptions from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terrorist attacks, pandemics, cybersecurity breaches, power or telecommunications failures or other natural or man-made disasters could materially interrupt operations, inflict financial or human capital losses, precipitate reputational harm or regulatory actions, and that the Company regularly assesses and enhances its business continuity plans, disaster recovery capabilities and key management succession to mitigate such risks; that reliance on third-party suppliers and outsourced services for critical data, software, systems and support functions introduces the risk of non-performance, delays, errors or security breaches, any of which could impair operational flexibility and require resource reallocation for recovery; that unanticipated legislative, regulatory or market changes—including evolving global financial regulations, increased regulation of credit ratings and benchmarks, Brexit and tax reform—as well as volatility in the capital, commodities and commercial markets may constrain resources, affect competitive advantage and force the Company to reconfigure strategic response trajectories; that acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions are pursued to strengthen core capabilities and focus on scalable markets but demand significant integration resources and may not yield the anticipated synergies, affecting organizational strength; that substantial investments in information technology, data centers and digital transformation initiatives aim to bolster system resilience but cannot guarantee full protection against data corruption, system failures or unauthorized intrusions; and that the Company’s strategic priorities of growth and excellence—emphasizing operational excellence, future orientation, digital innovation and international expansion—reflect a systemic perspective and resource reconfiguration trajectory model designed to absorb strain, adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain or improve functioning under adversity.

Apple’s 10-K discloses that its business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected by a wide range of internal and external pressures—from global and regional economic uncertainty, currency fluctuations and rapid technological change to supply-chain disruptions caused by natural or man-made disasters, information-technology failures, pandemics, political or regulatory actions, labor disputes and other events beyond its control—and describes a spectrum of continuity and mitigation measures designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.  The company maintains system redundancy and disaster recovery plans for its IT platforms, deploys diversified sourcing strategies and long-term supply agreements with prepayments, accrues cancellation-fee reserves and reviews inventories and manufacturing-related assets for obsolescence or impairment, and invests in manufacturing process equipment held at outsourcing partners to secure supply.  Apple also implements compliance policies, quality-control procedures and insurance programs, hedges foreign-currency and interest-rate exposures, monitors and protects customer and corporate data, and devotes significant resources to research and development, talent retention and reseller support initiatives—all of which enable rapid reconfiguration of resources, operational flexibility, risk assessment and recovery in response to disruptive events.  Together with its dynamic capital return program funded through operating cash flow and debt issuances, these strategic actions embody the company’s capacity for positive adjustment and performance maintenance under challenging or extraordinary conditions.

The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize its capacity for positive adjustment and continuity under challenging conditions by continuously adapting and expanding its services and solutions in response to ongoing technological change, economic volatility and evolving client needs, and by driving innovation to expand into new growth areas. To preserve operational integrity and performance despite external perturbations, the Company “proactively plan[s] and manage[s] the size and composition of our workforce and take[s] actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions,” including redeploying existing personnel or increasing reliance on subcontractors, engaging in actions to rebalance resources through reduced new hiring and involuntary terminations, and adjusting compensation practices to attract and retain talent. The Company further invests in business continuity and disaster recovery plans designed to mitigate the impact of natural disasters, political instability, strikes, civil unrest, hostilities, pandemics and extended disruptions of utilities or network services, while acknowledging that these plans “may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.” It also maintains cost-management actions—such as realignment of its workforce to lower-cost locations—and currency hedging programs and committed and uncommitted revolving credit facilities to manage liquidity, offset foreign exchange fluctuations and sustain its financial resilience. Finally, the Company recognizes the inherent limitations of its internal control over financial reporting and the risks posed by cybersecurity breaches and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data, noting that failures in these areas could materially disrupt its operations and its ability to deliver services under pressure.

Microsoft acknowledges that our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including rapid evolution of disruptive technologies, competition across platforms, ecosystems and devices, shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services, requiring us to reconfigure resources, innovate services and adjust strategic initiatives in response to environmental perturbations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud places a premium on the resilience of our systems and the strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation, and our increasing reliance on data-driven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality and operational efficiency. We devote significant resources to developing and deploying our cloud-based strategies, with success contingent on our ability to bring compelling cloud-based experiences to market, maintain the utility, compatibility and performance of those services across a growing array of devices, enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers, meet our customersâ€™ reliability and security expectations, and provide platform-agnostic availability across competing ecosystems; failure to execute these organizational and technical changes effectively may negatively impact revenue and operating margins. Maintaining, securing and expanding our infrastructure is expensive and complex, requiring us to uphold a robust and reliable internet connectivity architecture within evolving competitive and regulatory constraints; inefficiencies or operational failures could impair our ability to provide services, diminish customer experience and harm our financial condition. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services or performing other critical functions. As we grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information in an external environment hostile to information security, and despite our efforts to improve security controls both internally and for our customers, improper disclosure of customer data may harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure or subject us to liability, and perceptions of inadequate data protection could inhibit sales or cloud adoption and increase operating expenses. We also continue to make significant investments in new products, services and infrastructure, pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances and optimize our first-party device portfolio, with the success of these transactions and resource reconfigurations depending on our ability to integrate new businesses, leverage synergies and emerge stronger under competitive, regulatory and technological pressures.

The Company discloses that its multi‐year, fixed‐cost content commitments, while securing future streaming inventory, may constrain operating flexibility and adversely affect liquidity and results if membership acquisition and retention do not meet expectations. It emphasizes efforts to manage change and growth by expanding operations internationally, scaling its streaming service to accommodate anticipated increases in members and features, and building expertise across creative, marketing, legal, finance and other disciplines to address complex content offerings, varied consumer customs and evolving legal and regulatory environments. The Company has invested in a proprietary global content delivery network and utilizes third‐party cloud computing services, notably AWS, and acknowledges that any significant service disruption, technological failure or unauthorized access—due to natural disasters, cyber‐attacks or network operator practices—could degrade service, impede content delivery or compromise member data, requiring costly risk mitigation measures that may limit system functionality. It also identifies payment processing risks, changing privacy and data protection laws, net neutrality uncertainties and other regulatory or competitive pressures as factors that may necessitate alterations to its business model, incur additional expenses or hinder revenue growth. Liquidity management relies on free cash flow, although increased upfront investments in original programming may lead to negative cash flows despite overall profitability, potentially forcing the Company to delay investments, divest assets, restructure or refinance debt under adverse market conditions. Critical accounting judgments, such as estimating viewing patterns for content amortization, are subject to periodic reevaluation and can materially impact reported results, reflecting the Company’s ongoing efforts to allocate resources, reconfigure operations and enhance technical and organizational capabilities to preserve service integrity and adapt to internal and external disturbances in order to maintain functioning and performance under challenging conditions.

The Company acknowledges that it operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment in which new factors emerge unpredictably and could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations, and accordingly discloses and periodically updates a suite of strategies, processes and capabilities designed to absorb strain, mitigate risk and preserve or improve functioning under diverse internal and external pressures.  These include monitoring macro-economic conditions and adjusting resource allocation to address declines in consumer discretionary spending, investing in partner training, support and operational oversight of licensees and joint ventures to maintain product quality, service consistency and brand value, and maintaining incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans that are regularly tested and refined.  The Company continues to make significant investments in information technology security measures, third-party services and personnel to anticipate, prevent or minimize cyber-attacks, data breaches and system failures, and employs a market price risk management policy—using embedded supply-contract pricing features and financial derivatives—to hedge commodity price volatility and foreign currency exchange fluctuations.  Liquidity is managed through a diversified portfolio of cash and highly liquid securities, an unsecured revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program to ensure availability of working capital, funding for strategic growth initiatives, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions, while its disciplined capital allocation framework governs planned investment in new and remodeled stores, digital platforms and employee wages and benefits to reinforce operational flexibility, adaptability and future orientation.  Further, the Company articulates strategic initiatives such as expanding its store footprint, creating new customer occasions, extending digital engagement and deepening international presence to build dynamic capabilities, reconfigure operations in response to disruption, and transform the business so as to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

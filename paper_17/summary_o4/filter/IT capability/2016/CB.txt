In our risk management framework, we recognize that our organizationâ€™s ability to maintain the positive adjustment under challenging conditions depends on its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid both nominal and exceptional pressure from catastrophic events, regulatory changes, market volatility, and geopolitical disruptions. We have substantial exposure to losses from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, and cyber-attacks, which are inherently unpredictable and potentially severe, yet we endeavor to manage this exposure through disciplined underwriting processes, the use of underwriting controls, risk models, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance, including per-occurrence limitations, loss and loss expense ratio caps, geographic diversification, and collateral arrangements. Our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to accurately assess the potential losses we insure and reinsure, establish reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses through informed estimates and judgments underpinned by statistical and actuarial methods, and adjust reserves upward or downward as additional facts and trends become known over time. To mitigate operational risks, we implement contingency and business continuity plans to address disruptions to electrical, communications, transportation, or information systems infrastructure, continuously upgrade security measures against cyber incidents, and maintain crisis response procedures across hierarchical levels. We also use advanced analytical and modeling techniques to estimate exposures, loss trends, and other risks for underwriting, pricing, claims, reserving, and catastrophe risk, acknowledging that such models are subject to assumptions, uncertainties, and inherent limitations, and we hedge derivative-linked product exposures accordingly. To support our strategic resilience, we pursue capital and financing arrangements, maintain a high-quality investment portfolio, and access short-term liquidity sources such as repurchase agreements and syndicated credit facilities to fund unforeseen claim demands. We further recognize that sustaining performance under pressure requires adaptation to evolving legal, regulatory, and competitive landscapes, retention of critical personnel, integration of acquired businesses, and the ongoing refinement of our risk mitigation strategies to ensure organizational continuity and resilience in a turbulent business environment.

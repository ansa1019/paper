Despite system redundancy, security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for its internal and hosted information technology systems, the company acknowledges that “any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business” and that its systems remain “vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks.” To mitigate these operational risks, it “generally carry[s] earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity,” “evaluate[s] our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice” and in some cases “have elected to self-insure our earthquake exposure,” and likewise “carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity,” subject to coverage limitations and deductibles. The 10-K further recognizes exposure to climate change by noting that “if the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase.” Financial and strategic resilience is supported by geographic diversification of the property portfolio, hedging foreign currency and interest rate risk, maintenance of credit facilities with $3.2 billion available at year end, and the capacity to “find alternative ways to increase our liquidity, such as divesting ourselves of properties, incurring debt, entering into leases with new customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms.” Management underscores that “we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements,” and points to technology investments that “allow us to achieve efficiencies and increase our investments in real estate with minimal increases to general and administrative expenses” and “advanced data analysis to enhance decision making.” Ongoing compliance efforts—“establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different regions and to monitor compliance with applicable regulations”—and the focus on retaining “the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees” further reflect a systemic approach to absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning under challenging conditions.

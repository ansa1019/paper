Blackstone’s annual report emphasizes the firm’s focus on maintaining operations under adverse conditions by investing in disaster recovery and business continuity programs designed to support its New York headquarters and critical financial, accounting, communications and data processing systems in the event of infrastructure disruptions, service outages, natural disasters or security incidents. It notes that despite measures intended to ensure system integrity and guard against tampering, viruses, cyberattacks and other breaches, a successful attack or system failure could disable or degrade its systems, leading to financial loss, operational disruption, regulatory intervention or reputational harm. To address the challenge of volatile markets and revenue swings, the firm highlights its ability to scale back or eliminate services, adjust expense levels and reallocate resources quickly to align costs with lower revenues. In managing exposure to market and credit risks, Blackstone employs hedging strategies, derivative instruments and counterparty diversification to limit losses from changes in interest rates, currency exchange, commodity prices or market stress, while continuously reviewing and refining risk limits and controls. The report also recognizes its dependency on third-party service providers for fund administration and technology and underscores the importance of contingency planning to mitigate vendor interruptions. Overall, Blackstone presents a systemic perspective on resilience that combines business continuity planning, operational flexibility, resource reallocation and ongoing risk management to preserve its functioning and performance in the face of unexpected disruptions.

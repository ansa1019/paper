If we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients, and our ability to grow may be limited; our operations depend on receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information, and any unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service or similar act by a malevolent party could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or data, which could require us to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities; an operational failure in our transaction processing businesses, including our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, could harm our business or cause us to lose clients; we may experience software defects, development delays or installation difficulties, which could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims; a heightened regulatory environment may slow our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry, require us to make compliance investments and/or limit our fees or other revenue sources; we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives, including active portfolio management of our businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital and differentiating our products and services through innovation; we expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment; we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace; and our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends, ensuring liquidity and resource availability under adverse economic or market conditions.

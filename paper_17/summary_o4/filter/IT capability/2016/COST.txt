We believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to changes beyond our control—such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates, competitive conditions and rapidly changing gasoline prices—by adjusting our pricing and merchandise mix to maintain profitability and leverage selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales; our membership format, which is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue, materially influences our ability to absorb external pressures and preserve operating continuity; we achieve sales growth and resource deployment through the opening and relocation of new warehouses, both domestically and internationally, while managing the adverse effects of lower initial operating profitability, cannibalization and site-acquisition constraints; our investments in modernizing information systems, including the acceleration of vendor payments in advance of implementing a modernized accounting system, reflect a strategic initiative to increase operational flexibility and system resilience, even as these projects negatively impact near-term SG&A expenses; we maintain cost‐control discipline—particularly in merchandise costs, healthcare and utility expenses—and adopt a compensation philosophy that supports employee satisfaction and turnover reduction as a risk-mitigation measure; we manage inventory under LIFO in the U.S. and FIFO elsewhere to align current cost recognition with revenues and to preserve financial integrity during price deflation or inflation; our use of forward foreign‐exchange contracts and the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities provides a mechanism for mitigating currency volatility; we believe our cash position, operating cash flows, bank credit facilities, strategic repatriation of non-U.S. earnings and disciplined capital expenditure plans—including requirements for land, buildings and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses—will be sufficient to meet liquidity and capital requirements under both nominal and extreme conditions; and our critical accounting estimates for revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, insurance/self-insurance liabilities and uncertain tax positions are designed to ensure that our consolidated financial statements continue to reflect the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and support the preservation of organizational functioning and performance despite internal or external disturbances.

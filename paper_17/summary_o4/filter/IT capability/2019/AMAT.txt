Appliedâ€™s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by accurately forecasting demand and effectively managing resources, production capacity and costs across its cyclical semiconductor and display markets; during periods of increasing demand Applied must ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory, manage its supply chain, attract and retain qualified employees and control costs, while in downturns it must reduce costs, realign its cost structure, retain key personnel and absorb the strain of lower fab utilization without impairing its gross margins or net income. Its global operations expose it to external pressures such as uncertain economic and political conditions, trade policy changes, regulatory variations, supply chain and service interruptions from natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism and geopolitical instability, all of which require risk mitigation, business continuity measures, financial liquidity through cash reserves, credit facilities and investment portfolio management, and the flexibility to reconfigure operations rapidly in response to disruptions. Even during economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied continues to invest in research and development and maintain its global infrastructure to preserve or improve functioning and competitive advantage, illustrating its capacity to adapt, absorb external disturbances and sustain performance, integrity and recovery in the face of adversity.

Our filings note that volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and global macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics can undermine business confidence, cause clients to reduce or defer spending and disrupt our ability to accurately forecast demand and build revenue and resource plans, highlighting the need to maintain operational flexibility and positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We stress our reliance on driving innovation and adapting and expanding our services and solutions—particularly in digital, cloud and security offerings—to serve evolving client needs and transform our capabilities toward new growth areas, while recognizing that delays in client technology adoption can negatively impact our results of operations. To preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances, we proactively plan, recruit, reskill, retain and, when necessary, rebalance our workforce—including through redeployment or involuntary terminations—to keep our supply of market-leading skills in balance with client demand, thereby sustaining our competitive advantage. Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and alliance relationships to augment our organizational capabilities, absorb strain during disruptive change and reconfigure our capacity for the ensuing future. We maintain comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans to mitigate risks from terrorist activity, hostilities, natural disasters, pandemics, infrastructure failures or cyberattacks, acknowledging that shutdowns, unauthorized disclosures or system disruptions could damage our systems, reputation and client relationships. We are subject to evolving and sometimes conflicting legal, regulatory and cybersecurity requirements across jurisdictions, necessitating robust risk assessment, compliance programs and internal controls to protect client and company data, enforce intellectual property rights and sustain system integrity. These combined measures reflect our systemic perspective on resilience—foreseeing and confronting disturbances, preserving partial maintenance of performance under pressure and configuring strategic response mechanisms to emerge stronger from exceptional conditions.

We have established an integrated risk management framework, overseen by the board of directors and its committees, a cross-functional senior management risk committee and division and country risk committees, together with a dedicated risk management office, to identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety and reputational risks and to report progress on our risk mitigation efforts, thereby supporting business continuity and preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We maintain and update contingency plans across our global operations to address natural disasters, pandemics, supply-chain disruptions, geopolitical and regulatory changes, water scarcity, climate-related impacts and cybersecurity threats, and we devote significant resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery to ensure operational resilience. We deploy productivity initiatives designed to simplify, harmonize and automate processes, re-engineer go-to-market and information systems, optimize manufacturing and supply-chain footprints and transform our shared services and organizational structures through acquisitions, refranchisings and joint ventures, enabling us to absorb strain, reconfigure operating models and redeploy resources toward sustainable growth. We manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate volatility through centrally managed global purchasing programs and derivative hedges, and we continuously monitor consumer trends, competitive pressures, retail landscape shifts including accelerated e-commerce, and evolving packaging, labeling and tax policies to adjust our strategic response, resource allocation and product innovation, thereby maintaining system integrity and enhancing our ability to respond effectively to disruptive events.

UPS recognizes that its operations are exposed to a wide range of internal and external pressures—from adverse general economic conditions, evolving regulatory requirements in aviation, transportation, environmental and security domains, to intense competitive forces and fluctuations in customer demand—that may require significant capital expenditures and complex adjustments to its business model in order to maintain continuity of service and protect its reputation. The company warns that failure to adapt its integrated air and ground network capacity to match volume changes, to manage labor disruptions such as strikes or work stoppages, or to reconcile shifting trade agreements and customer relationships, could materially impair its ability to provide uninterrupted service. To preserve operational integrity under fuel price volatility, UPS applies indexed fuel surcharges and employs hedging transactions, while also monitoring and mitigating exposures to currency and interest rate movements through derivative instruments, albeit acknowledging that not all risks can be fully hedged. The firm has invested continuously in automated sorting facilities, technology-enabled solutions and expanded fleet and facility capacity to enhance delivery productivity and network flexibility, and it maintains robust information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to guard against cyber-attacks, natural disasters, pandemics and other disruptions. Liquidity and resource allocation are supported by sustained cash reserves, access to commercial paper and debt capital markets, strategic share repurchases, dividend programs and discretionary pension funding, all designed to bolster the organization’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and sustain performance in the face of adversity.

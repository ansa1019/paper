In item 1A, the company discloses that its business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competitive pressures, evolving consumer preferences and trends, disruptions in the supply chain, information technology and real estate operations, and external shocks such as pandemics, natural disasters, geopolitical events and regulatory changes. The report describes strategic initiatives such as substantial investments to create an interconnected retail and supply chain network, the “one home depot experience,” the implementation of new processes and technology systems, and the development of strategic alliances with suppliers to differentiate product offerings and drive efficiency and flexibility. The company highlights its reliance on the integrity, security and consistent operation of information technology systems for sales, inventory replenishment, demand forecasting and order fulfillment, and acknowledges potential failures arising from cyber-attacks, design errors and catastrophic events, while noting ongoing efforts to maintain, update and secure these systems. The pandemic response includes canceling or shifting events and support operations to virtual formats, reducing store hours, managing foot traffic, shifting store support to remote work, and expanding paid time off policies to protect associates and maintain operational continuity. The company emphasizes its need to attract, develop and retain skilled associates, control labor costs, manage aging store infrastructure and maintain safety to ensure consistent service and mitigate shrink, while also adjusting marketing, advertising and promotional programs to address changes in the competitive landscape and customer expectations. Further disclosures identify risks to liquidity and capital resources, including reliance on cash flow from operations, commercial paper programs and credit facilities, and note that the company may adjust capital expenditures and suspend share repurchases in response to market turbulence. Supply chain and vendor management risks are also detailed, including dependencies on qualified suppliers, trade policy changes, logistical constraints and the need to maintain responsible sourcing audits. Across these disclosures, the company articulates processes and resource allocations—ranging from real estate projects and IT infrastructure upgrades to human capital investments and crisis management protocols—aimed at preserving or restoring operations under adverse conditions and maintaining performance, illustrating an implicit system resilience through investments in adaptability, risk mitigation, operational flexibility and organizational continuity.

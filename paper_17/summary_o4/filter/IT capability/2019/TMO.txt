We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive, emphasizing significant investment in and expenditures for product development and the need to anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customersâ€™ products. To support internal growth and preserve organizational continuity under challenging conditions, we are pursuing strategies including strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets, allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects, developing new applications for our technologies, continuing key customer initiatives, combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets, finding new markets for our products and enhancing commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties that may reduce demand for our products, increase price pressure or cause supply interruptions which could disrupt our ability to produce, and we seek to mitigate such external pressures through productivity improvements, global sourcing initiatives and strategic growth investments. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection and on executing and, when necessary, improving our quality management strategy and systems, including effective training and facility controls, to prevent errors or failures that could halt production or require destruction of products. Our strategy also includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing offerings to reconfigure resources and capabilities, and we manage operational risks related to third-party package-delivery providers, natural disasters, public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events that could disrupt our facilities or those of our suppliers, customers or service providers, maintaining disaster recovery planning and insurance programs to preserve functioning under adverse conditions. Financial resilience is reflected in our liquidity and capital resources, with consolidated working capital of $5.70 billion at December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents of $2.40 billion, access to a $2.50 billion revolving credit facility, net proceeds from divestitures and available borrowing capacity, alongside letters of credit, bank guarantees, residual value guarantees and indemnification liabilities to address contingent obligations and ensure continued performance under internal or external variations.

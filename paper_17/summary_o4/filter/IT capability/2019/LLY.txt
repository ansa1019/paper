We manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules so that a delay in, or termination of, any single project will not materially change our total investment, employ a controlled enterprise risk-management program using derivative instruments—including interest rate swaps and foreign-currency forward and option contracts—to limit the impact of market fluctuations on earnings and cash flows, and maintain and continuously enhance the resiliency of our IT systems by implementing measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize cyber-security risks and to uphold the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data—supplemented by cyber liability insurance—to preserve operational continuity and system performance under adverse or disruptive conditions.

The Company discloses that its operations depend on the continuous receipt, storage, processing and transmission of sensitive business and consumer information and that any unauthorized access, network intrusion, system failure or similar incident could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of its systems or the systems of its clients, partners or vendors, potentially resulting in costly litigation, financial liability, increased regulatory scrutiny and loss of client confidence. It expects to continue investing significant resources to maintain and enhance information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. The Company further acknowledges that its business depends heavily on the reliability of its processing platforms and that operational failures—arising from hardware or software defects, cyberattacks, human error, natural disasters or other external events—could delay implementations, interrupt service availability, cause data loss, damage its reputation, erode client relationships and reduce revenue. It also emphasizes that the interconnected nature of the global financial system means that disruptions affecting other participants may prevent it from delivering products and services, and that dependence on third-party vendors for key products and services exposes it to information security, financial, compliance and reputational risks if those vendors fail to perform. In its merchant acquiring business, the Company is subject to the risk of merchant insolvency or fraud, which could increase its chargeback liability and require active risk management. The Company’s international operations are exposed to natural disasters, public health crises, political instability, terrorism, war and regulatory changes such as Brexit that could disrupt the free movement of goods, services, data and people, create legal uncertainty and currency fluctuations, and adversely affect its relationships with clients and vendors. Together, these disclosures describe the Company’s reliance on resilience strategies—such as risk mitigation, system redundancy, security investments and operational continuity planning—to absorb strain, adapt to adversity and preserve or restore critical functions under challenging conditions.

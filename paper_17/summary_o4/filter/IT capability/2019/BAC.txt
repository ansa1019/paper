The annual report describes the corporation’s efforts to maintain operational continuity under challenging conditions by deploying “backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience,” while acknowledging that “in the event that backup systems are available and utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems” and that the “ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited.” It outlines a comprehensive contingency planning framework—including a “financial contingency and recovery plan,” a “contingency funding plan” and a preferred “single point of entry” resolution strategy—designed to ensure access to diverse funding sources, preserve liquidity through “global liquidity sources” of cash and high-quality unencumbered securities, and, where necessary, “borrow against eligible assets” at the Federal Reserve or Federal Home Loan Banks to sustain performance under market stress, natural disasters, health emergencies, pandemics or other “unexpected circumstances.” The report further emphasizes the importance of business continuity in the face of “failures in or breaches of our operational or security systems or infrastructure,” “electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages,” and cyber-attack or systemic “technology failure,” all of which “could disrupt our critical business operations and customer services, result in regulatory, market, privacy, liquidity and operational risk exposures, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.” These initiatives reflect the firm’s focus on risk mitigation, strategic resource allocation and robust response mechanisms to preserve functioning, support rapid recovery and sustain firm performance under pressure.

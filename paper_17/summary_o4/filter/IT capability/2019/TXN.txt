TI acknowledges that its susceptibility to macroeconomic weakness and volatility in general market conditions—including protectionist trade barriers, currency fluctuations and rapid technological change—may adversely affect its performance and that of its customers, potentially disrupting product delivery, manufacturing operations and production processes. The company is exposed to a range of internal and external pressures—political, social, economic and security risks; transportation, communications and IT network disruptions; severe weather, geological events and health epidemics—that could interrupt operations and threaten business continuity. To mitigate these risks and preserve performance, TI makes significant investments in research and development, advanced manufacturing technologies and in-house production capacity, undertakes strategic business and organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, and maintains diversified global supply chains while securing critical raw materials, natural resources and utilities. Ongoing efforts to defend against IT breaches, system failures or unauthorized access in its own networks and those of partners support operational flexibility and information integrity. Liquidity and financial resilience are sustained primarily through cash flow from operations, supplemented by cash, short-term investments and a revolving credit facility, providing resources to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and debt obligations for at least the next 12 months. Supply-chain consignment arrangements, inventory-to-demand matching processes and structured allowances for returns, obsolescence and quality issues further bolster adaptability. Management’s critical accounting judgments—on revenue recognition, income taxes and inventory valuation—reflect continuous risk assessment and system integrity, enabling TI to absorb strain, maintain functionality and reconfigure strategic trajectories when faced with nominal, extreme or exceptional disturbances.

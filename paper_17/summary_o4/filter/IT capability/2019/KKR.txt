KKR seeks to maintain business continuity and operational flexibility under challenging conditions by employing extensive risk mitigation strategies, including disaster recovery and business continuation programs, although it acknowledges these may not be sufficient if data processing systems or third-party infrastructure are disabled, disrupted or compromised. The firm attempts to mitigate known economic, market and operational risks to the extent practicable, including reliance on diversified funding sources, credit facilities and liquidity management to ensure access to capital, but makes no assurance this will always safeguard its ability to absorb strain or preserve functioning in extreme market downturns or funding stresses. KKR’s operations depend on secure information systems and the management of ongoing cyber-security threats, with investments in technology controls and contingency plans for potential execution, confirmation or settlement errors. In response to fluctuating interest rates, market volatility, credit spread widening, regulatory changes and geopolitical events, KKR actively monitors and adapts its investment strategies, reconfigures balance sheet deployments and co-investment vehicles, and recalibrates resource allocation across public and private markets. The firm’s capital allocation and carried-interest recognition frameworks incorporate assessments of preferred return thresholds and netting-hole provisions to balance performance and partner proceeds, while tax receivable, clawback and preferred stock arrangements create mechanisms that reinforce the integrity and resilience of its financial structure. Through rigorous governance, compliance and contractual indemnification provisions, KKR addresses operational, legal, regulatory and liquidity contingencies, reflecting a systemic perspective on maintaining organizational strength, adaptability and continuity in the face of internal or external pressures.

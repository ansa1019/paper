The company’s disclosures describe a broad set of structures, processes and resource allocations designed to preserve or restore its functioning under stress: its risk factors emphasize the need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements through supply-chain optimization, sole-supplier strategies and business continuity plans to address disruptions from natural disasters, extreme weather, trade-policy changes, political volatility or credit-market crises; the information and operational technology risk management program, overseen by cross-functional stakeholders, the audit committee and the board, includes analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats, ongoing monitoring and updates to networks and systems, investment in specialized security skills, employee training, updated security policies and remediation measures to protect system integrity and ensure operational continuity in the event of cyber-attacks or IT/OT failures; global currency and interest-rate hedging, access to committed bank credit facilities and disciplined liquidity management support its ability to absorb strain from foreign exchange fluctuations, credit-market disruptions and Brexit-related uncertainty; ongoing multi-year productivity and cost-savings initiatives, including supply-chain, marketing and overhead efficiency programs, staffing adjustments and organizational redesign into sector business units, reflect its capacity to reconfigure trajectories of responses, redeploy resources and sustain performance under challenging conditions; its management of acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, together with integration and dissolution activities, illustrates dynamic capability to realign the business portfolio and capture growth synergies; and its strategic focus on disciplined investing, compliance and ethics programs, forward-looking planning and defined priorities for dividends, share repurchases and discretionary investments further demonstrate the firm’s systemic orientation toward maintaining integrity, mitigating risks and emerging stronger from both internal and external disturbances.

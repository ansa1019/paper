Prologis maintains comprehensive measures to preserve its operational integrity and adapt to disturbances by implementing system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan for its internal and hosted information technology systems to mitigate the impact of energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber-security attacks, while acknowledging that any system failure could materially disrupt its business and incur additional recovery costs. The Company continuously reviews and enhances its disclosure controls, internal control over financial reporting and risk assessment procedures, including annual evaluations of property damage, hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorism and environmental insurance coverage (and self-insurance where commercially reasonable), to absorb strain from hazards and preserve functioning under exceptional conditions. To manage financial and market perturbations, it employs geographic diversification of real estate investments, co-investment ventures to share liquidity and capital deployment risks, natural hedges through borrowing in currencies matching its international investments, designated derivative instruments for net investment hedges, and active debt-maturity management—up-sizing credit facilities, extending weighted-average maturities and opportunistically refinancing—to maintain access to capital even amid global credit market turmoil. Prologis reserves the flexibility to reconfigure its portfolio by divesting or contributing properties to co-investment ventures, adjusting development or leasing strategies, incurring short-term borrowings as required by REIT distribution rules, or modifying lease terms and capital expenditures to respond to economic downturns, customer defaults or regulatory shifts, thereby allocating resources and reconfiguring trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events. Its strategic planning and budgeting processes incorporate systemic analyses of portfolio-level operating performance, occupancy, rental rate growth and development pipelines under variable market and environmental conditions, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation of integrity and performance in the face of internal or external variations.

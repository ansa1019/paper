The annual report outlines a comprehensive set of practices and structures designed to preserve the organization’s integrity and functional performance under challenging and rapidly changing conditions, beginning with forward‐looking risk management and extensive scenario planning that anticipate disruptions ranging from regulatory reforms and pricing pressures to natural disasters, public health crises and cybersecurity breaches. It emphasizes the allocation of financial and human resources to continuous research and development, patent protection, process improvement programs and supply chain network optimization through its global restructuring initiatives, notably the 2019 restructuring plan, while maintaining dedicated response teams and mitigation protocols for Brexit and other geopolitical uncertainties. The company describes its use of diversified financing arrangements, including credit facilities, commercial paper programs and hedging strategies, to safeguard liquidity and absorb currency fluctuations, and highlights rigorous controls over manufacturing, clinical trials and regulatory compliance to prevent operational breakdowns. Governance mechanisms, including a crisis committee and board‐level oversight of escalating enterprise‐level issues, support rapid decision making and crisis response, while structured integration processes for acquisitions—spanning IT, R&D, supply chain, quality systems and organizational realignment—demonstrate its capability to reconfigure and adapt its operations in the face of adversity. Continuous evaluation of legal, tax and competitive risks, maintenance of inventory and receivable provisions, and efforts to preserve relationships with diverse suppliers and customers collectively reflect an operational flexibility and resilience strategy aimed at sustaining performance and competitive advantage despite internal and external disturbances.

Our 10-K discloses that “despite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located,” and further warns that “despite our efforts to maintain business continuity” at key locations such as our New York headquarters, a catastrophic event—terrorist attack, extreme weather or other hostile event—could impair our ability to service clients and execute contingency plans. We maintain a contingency funding plan “to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis … including potential risk factors, key reports and metrics, mitigants, and actions to meet potential cash and collateral needs,” and a contingency capital plan “to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency … identifying drivers of a capital deficiency, mitigants, potential actions, and communication procedures during a crisis period.” In support of our preferred resolution strategy, we have established a resolution capital adequacy and positioning framework and a triggers and alerts framework “designed to provide the board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings.” Governance for resilience includes a firmwide resilience and operational risk committee, “globally responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience,” in conjunction with the firmwide enterprise risk committee’s oversight of our enterprise risk management framework and the risk governance committee’s approval of related policies, limits and stress-test results. This integrated approach to business continuity, stress testing, contingency planning and governance reflects an emphasis on preserving operational functionality and financial integrity under a range of internal and external adverse conditions.

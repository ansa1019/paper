Our 2019 Form 10-K discloses that our operations and financial results “are subject to various risks and uncertainties … which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results,” and emphasizes that to preserve or improve functioning despite such pressures we “must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner” and “continue to invest significant resources in research and development … in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.” We recognize that external disturbances—from cyclical advertising expenditures and shifting device, geographic, product and policy mixes to supply shortages driven by natural disasters, climate change and geopolitical trade barriers—require us to maintain operational flexibility and business continuity through significant investments in data centers, information technology infrastructure, disaster recovery planning, and a new global ERP system whose “failure to successfully design and implement … as planned could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.” Our risk mitigation mechanisms include hedging programs for foreign currency volatility, strategic collaborations with distribution partners and network members, and ongoing reinforcement of intellectual property rights and strong brands to support competitive advantage. We further commit to resilience through diversification of revenue streams—such as Google Cloud and Google Play—and through acquisitions, while acknowledging that these “inherently risky” endeavors may “disrupt our current operations” and require reconfiguration of resources and management focus. In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we note that as user behaviors and advertising “continue to shift online” and “users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities,” we “seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of these trends,” devote “significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices,” and rely on our employees—“among our best assets”—to hire, develop and retain talent critical to sustaining organizational health and adaptive capacity in the face of evolving regulatory, technological, security, and market challenges.

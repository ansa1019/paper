NVIDIA’s disclosures emphasize that business disruptions—from earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, cyber-attacks, pandemics or other natural or man-made disasters—could interrupt critical functions, require substantial expenditures and recovery time to resume operations, and harm revenues, margins and reputation, underscoring the need for business continuity planning and operational flexibility. The company acknowledges its dependence on third-party foundries and subcontractors located in earthquake-prone regions and on a limited number of suppliers, highlighting supply chain vulnerability and the importance of diversifying suppliers and maintaining adequate manufacturing capacity to absorb strain and adapt to component shortages or delays. NVIDIA devotes significant technical, financial and compliance resources to research and development, infrastructure, security and reliability engineering to anticipate rapid technological change, evolving customer requirements and emerging industry standards, and to continuously enhance product functionality and security features—measures that preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions. Its inventory management processes, which include writing down excess or obsolete inventory based on forecasts of customer demand, market conditions and competitor pricing actions, reflect a system’s ability to maintain integrity and performance in the face of internal variations. The firm’s strategic direction relies on anticipating market opportunities, timely adaptation of product and service offerings, and the allocation of resources to scale customer service and support, thereby supporting competitive advantage and resilience to external pressures. NVIDIA maintains diversified cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, credit facilities and a commercial paper program to ensure liquidity and fund strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, while mitigating financial risks. It also emphasizes legal, regulatory and intellectual property protections, governance structures and compliance programs to manage litigation, tax, trade and security risks, thereby supporting continuity and performance maintenance under challenging conditions. Finally, its global operations and partner networks expose it to geopolitical, economic and regulatory changes, requiring ongoing adaptation, risk assessment and resource reconfiguration to preserve organizational health and emerge stronger from disruptions.

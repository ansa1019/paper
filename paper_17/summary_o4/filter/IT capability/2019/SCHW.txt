The Charles Schwab Corporation’s disclosures describe an “enterprise risk management (ERM) framework” approved by the Board of Directors that incorporates the firm’s purpose, vision, and values to set the tone for the organization and enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. Senior management, through the Global Risk Committee and functional risk sub-committees (covering operational, financial, compliance, model, incentive compensation, and new products risk), actively oversees risk appetite, establishes risk metrics, limits, and tolerance levels, and reports to the Board. Operational risk is mitigated through systems and procedures “designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the company’s risk appetite,” including a “backup and recovery infrastructure” with geographically dispersed facilities, routine testing of “business continuity and disaster recovery plans,” and a well-established “incident management program.” Information security is addressed via a program that “knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data,” deploying advanced monitoring, collaboration with external authorities, and employee training to deter and respond to cyber threats. Schwab manages fraud, third-party, conduct, compliance, and fiduciary risks through policies, procedures, internal controls, periodic self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews. Credit risk is controlled by setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of counterparty quality, and adjusting margin, pledged-asset, option, and futures requirements. Liquidity and capital resilience are supported by policies and procedures ensuring sufficient funding under “normal and stressed conditions,” regular “liquidity stress testing,” early warning indicators, diversified funding sources, and a capital contingency plan to maintain regulatory capital requirements, including the liquidity coverage ratio. The firm also emphasizes the importance of maintaining reliable, scalable technology systems for high-volume transaction processing, making timely enhancements, and restoring functionality after “system interruptions, errors or downtime,” recognizing that “despite our efforts to identify areas of risk…there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses,” thus requiring ongoing investments in resilience strategies. This integrated governance and control structure underpins Schwab’s ability to preserve “operational continuity,” adapt to disruptions, and maintain performance under adverse conditions, aligning with the concept of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

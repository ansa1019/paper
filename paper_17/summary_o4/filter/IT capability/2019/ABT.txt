Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, monitoring its IT infrastructure on an ongoing basis for current or potential threats and regulatory changes. The company regularly analyzes historical rebate and allowance trends, adjusts reserves for changes in program terms, monitors customer creditworthiness, establishes allowances for doubtful receivables, communicates on payment plans, and, where appropriate, employs receivables factoring to mitigate credit risk. Management leverages large customersâ€™ inventory management data to make reliable estimates of distribution channel inventory and ensure operational continuity. Abbott expects annual operating cash flow to exceed capital expenditures and dividends, maintains unused unsecured credit lines supporting up to $5 billion of borrowings, and sustains an investment-grade credit rating to preserve financial flexibility. Over the last several years, Abbott proactively reshaped its portfolio through the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere and the divestiture of Abbott Medical Optics, approving integration and cost-reduction restructuring plans, managing early redemptions and repayments of several billion dollars of debt, and realigning its reporting segments to support sustainable growth. The company commits substantial resources to research and development, immediately expensing acquired R&D assets and targeting approximately 7 percent of sales for competitive R&D spending, while adapting to evolving regulatory and accounting frameworks (including adoption of ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-02, ASU 2016-01, ASU 2018-02 and ASU 2019-12), ensuring compliance with FDA, EU and international medical device, in vitro diagnostics and nutritional product requirements to mitigate potential operational disruptions. Abbott funds defined benefit pension and post-employment benefits based on actuarial assumptions, amortizes actuarial gains and losses over service periods, and expects $387 million of pension contributions in 2020. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaling over $40 billion are reviewed annually or upon triggering events using undiscounted cash flows and quantitative fair-value assessments to safeguard asset integrity and detect impairment risks under varying market conditions.

NEE and FPL disclose a range of operational and financial measures designed to absorb strain and preserve or restore functioning under adverse conditions, including extensive reliance on regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms, reserve amortizations and insurance programs to fund storm restoration and nuclear decommissioning, the maintenance of revolving and bilateral credit facilities and liquidity reserves to ensure timely access to capital, and the use of derivative instruments for fuel, power, interest rate and foreign exchange hedges under formal exposure-management policies.  In addition, they describe governance structures such as an exposure management committee and capital covenant requirements that facilitate rapid reconfiguration of financial and project resources in response to regulatory, market or legislative changes, as well as contractual collateral and master netting arrangements to mitigate counterparty performance risk.  The companies further emphasize planning, permitting and construction processes, contingency reserves for project delays and cost overruns, and cybersecurity and information-systems security measures to manage operational continuity risks arising from natural disasters, cyberattacks, infrastructure outages or other unexpected events, thereby reflecting a systemic approach to maintaining integrity and service delivery under internal and external pressures.

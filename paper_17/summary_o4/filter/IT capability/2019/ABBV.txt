AbbVie’s 2019 Form 10-K repeatedly emphasizes the company’s need to anticipate and manage internal and external variations that could adversely affect its operations, noting that “any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie’s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows,” which underscores the allocation of resources to risk mitigation, business continuity and operational flexibility. Management describes how “problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons” – including equipment malfunction, regulatory requirements or natural disasters – that “could lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations” and product shortages, and details its reliance on single-source suppliers while carrying “business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier.” The report further notes that its information technology systems “are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown,” prompting investments in protection and ongoing monitoring to avoid “legal, financial, reputational or business harm.” AbbVie also recognizes that its “success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel” even as it faces intense competition for talent, and that dependence on three wholesale distributors could “adversely affect AbbVie’s business” if those partners encounter financial difficulties. Liquidity and access to capital are managed through an amended five-year revolving credit facility, commercial paper borrowings and the issuance of long-term debt “to meet liquidity requirements,” while dividend policy and share repurchases reflect strategic allocation of financial resources to sustain growth. In response to regulatory pressures, AbbVie observes that “delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products … could disrupt AbbVie’s business,” and it commits “substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development” amid global legislative and pricing pressures that may erode revenues and require adaptation of business practices. Finally, the company outlines its 2020 strategic objectives to “diversify revenue streams, ensure strong commercial execution, drive late-stage pipeline assets to the market, expand operating margins, return cash to shareholders” and to complete and integrate the proposed Allergan acquisition, demonstrating a structured reconfiguration of resources and capabilities to maintain performance and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

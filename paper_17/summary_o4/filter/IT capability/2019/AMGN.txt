During the year, we highlighted our reliance on uninterrupted operation of our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and in Thousand Oaks, California, noting our installation of backup diesel-powered generators following Hurricane Maria and the early 2020 earthquakes and our ongoing contingency planning to mitigate power failures, transportation disruptions and natural disasters, reflecting business continuity and emergency management practices. We also described our dependence on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, components and drug delivery devices sourced from sole sources, stressing that unexpected demand, quality issues or supplier failures could lead to clinical trial delays, production failures, supply constraints, stock-outs or recalls of our products, underscoring our emphasis on risk assessment, supply-chain resilience and operational flexibility. Similarly, we noted that our distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky, and Breda, Netherlands, and our reliance on commercial transportation expose us to natural disasters or security threats that could materially impair our ability to deliver products. We discussed concentration of sales through major wholesaler distributors and free-standing dialysis partners and the impact of payer consolidation as external pressures requiring strategic response and resource allocation. Our disclosures further addressed the potential for extended government shutdowns to delay FDA activities, health emergencies such as novel viruses to disrupt clinical trial timing, and the need for enhanced compliance programs following anti-corruption settlement obligations, demonstrating resilience strategies in regulatory and legal environments. In addition, we emphasized our use of interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts to manage financial risks, our revolving credit and commercial paper programs to safeguard liquidity, and the importance of internal controls over cyber-attacks and information security breaches, thereby preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems and network-connected control systems. Finally, we recognized the risks from global economic conditions, currency fluctuations, evolving tax regimes and legislative and regulatory reforms on pricing and reimbursement and described our collaborations and acquisitions designed to reconfigure the organizationâ€™s resources, adapt to market volatility and preserve functioning under adverse conditions, illustrating our commitment to systemic resilience, adaptation strategies and maintenance of performance under pressure.

Starbucks describes its incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans as central to resolving operational disruptions—from power outages to system failures—and to mitigating risks posed by natural disasters, supply chain interruptions or security breaches. The company continues to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent or minimize breaches or data loss, while training, supporting and monitoring a diverse network of licensees, joint ventures and suppliers to preserve product quality and service consistency under varying market conditions. To manage commodity price volatility for coffee, dairy and other inputs, Starbucks uses pricing features embedded in supply contracts alongside financial derivatives governed by a formal commodity price risk management policy, and to reduce foreign-currency cash flow volatility it employs derivative instruments. Its unsecured revolving credit and commercial paper programs, complemented by disciplined capital allocation of operating cash flows—funding store openings, strategic initiatives, partner investments and shareholder returns—provide liquidity and financial flexibility. Operational safeguards, debt covenants and ongoing reassessment of tax and regulatory exposures support a systemic enterprise risk management framework that underpins the company’s ability to absorb strain, maintain performance and adapt to evolving economic, regulatory and competitive pressures.

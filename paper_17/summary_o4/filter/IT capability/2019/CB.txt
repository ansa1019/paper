We disclose substantial exposure to losses from natural and man-made catastrophes and describe our multi-layered strategy to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, including disciplined underwriting controls, advanced risk models, establishment and ongoing actuarial evaluation of reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses, and purchase of third-party reinsurance, excess-of-loss treaties, catastrophe bonds, retrocessional protection and aggregate stop-loss programs to mitigate volatility and reconstitute capacity following disruptive events. We employ analytical modeling—scenario, predictive, stochastic and forecasting techniques—to set probable maximum loss limits, conduct stress tests, assist decision making in underwriting, claims, reserving and catastrophe risk management, and reconfigure portfolios through geographic diversification, risk transfer assessments and structured transactions. Our investment strategy emphasizes liquidity, principal conservation and duration matching of assets with insurance liabilities, supplemented by repurchase agreements, syndicated credit facilities and notional cash-pooling to maintain operational flexibility and business continuity under extreme conditions. We manage variable annuity guarantee risks by applying risk transfer analyses at inception, capping accumulations, limiting exposures, and hedging derivative positions, while collateral arrangements protect our statutory and financial strength. We maintain contingency plans and technical, administrative and contractual controls to address operational disruptions—including cyber-attacks, pandemics and infrastructure failures—to ensure critical business functions can continue, recover, and emerge stronger, thereby demonstrating our capacity for positive adjustment, adaptation, and resilience under challenging and unexpected circumstances.

Issues such as global market and economic volatility, geopolitical events including pandemics and governmental shutdowns, and rapidly evolving public health crises like the novel coronavirus outbreak have created disruption in global supply chains, imposed quarantines and travel restrictions, and contributed to sustained market uncertainty that could materially impair our ability to raise or deploy capital, sustain portfolio company operations and preserve financial performance. Our business continuity depends on complex information systems and technology infrastructure, and a disaster, cybersecurity incident or other disruption—such as the disabling of electronic communications, failure of third-party services or an attack on our networks—could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations without interruption, even though we maintain disaster recovery and business continuity programs designed to mitigate such harm and leverage forward contracts, derivatives and liquidity facilities to manage market and credit risk. In challenging environments, we may be forced to reduce fixed costs, reallocate resources, adjust underwriting standards and leverage arrangements, or alter financing and investment strategies to preserve functioning under pressure, yet there is no assurance that these measures, or our capacity to absorb strain under extreme or exceptional conditions, will fully offset adverse impacts or prevent significant losses. Periods of sustained economic slowdown, reduced market liquidity or heightened regulatory and cyber risks may require accelerated cost containment or asset realizations at depressed values, expose us to losses on matured debt and equity positions, and increase the risk of operational, financing and reputational strains despite our ongoing efforts to monitor, adapt, recover and reconfigure both organizational practices and portfolio exposures across multiple industries and geographies.

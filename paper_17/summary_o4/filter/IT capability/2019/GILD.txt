If we are unable to maintain or increase our HIV product sales, our results of operations would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development efforts, while unpredictable shifts in patient demand, wholesaler inventories and reimbursement levels make it difficult to forecast sales and may cause fluctuations in revenue and earnings that require operational flexibility and rapid resource reconfiguration. Manufacturing problems at our own facilities or those of third-party manufacturers, inventory management issues and supply-chain bottlenecks could cause inventory shortages, delayed product shipments and regulatory approval setbacks, underscoring the need for continuity planning, risk mitigation measures and adaptability under internal or external disturbances. Disruptions from natural or man-made disasters—such as earthquakes, public health emergencies, climate-related events or terrorist attacks—could materially impair our research, manufacturing and commercial functions, highlighting our exposure to extreme or exceptional conditions and the importance of emergency management and resilience strategies. Our reliance on complex FDA and international regulatory frameworks, evolving legislative and pricing pressures, ongoing litigation and government investigations, and potential safety issues all represent hazards that demand systematic risk assessment, crisis response mechanisms and dynamic capabilities to preserve organizational integrity and performance. We depend on inter-organizational collaboration with contract research organizations, distributors, apheresis centers and corporate partners for clinical trials, logistics and commercialization, and a failure by any of these parties to perform or comply can require rapid reconfiguration of relationships, processes and resources. Our information technology systems and data—including platforms critical to chain of identity and custody for cell therapies—are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and data-privacy requirements, which could disrupt operations and require robust prevention, detection and recovery protocols. Human capital remains a critical organizational capability, and challenges in attracting, developing and retaining qualified personnel can impair our ability to respond to unexpected situations, reallocate resources and sustain organizational health. Finally, competitive dynamics, generic competition, counterfeits, imports from lower-price markets and changes in reimbursement create external pressures that demand foresight, strategic adaptation and resourcefulness to preserve functioning and emerge stronger from adversity.

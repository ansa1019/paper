The Company routinely identifies, assesses and addresses a wide range of risks and has implemented comprehensive risk‐management and continuity programs—including disaster recovery, business continuity, crisis management and compliance procedures—to protect its operations against natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, regulatory changes, cyber‐attacks, data breaches, service interruptions and other unexpected events. It maintains risk-based anti-money-laundering, anti-corruption and trade-sanctions controls, privacy and cyber‐security protocols, and continuously reviews, upgrades and enhances related policies and procedures, even as it secures insurance coverage and standby letters of credit to mitigate residual exposures. The Company has established liquidity and funding strategies—utilizing client funds impoundment, short-term financing through commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements, multi-year committed credit facilities and corporate cash balances—and an investment portfolio laddered out to five and ten-year maturities to absorb interest-rate volatility while preserving the ability to satisfy obligations. It monitors and manages its critical systems, applications and data centers through ongoing enhancements, operational efficiencies, automation and strategic capital expenditures, and executes broad corporate transformation initiatives—such as voluntary early retirement, service-alignment and workforce-optimization programs—to streamline organizational structure, reconfigure resources, strengthen talent and culture, and support continuous revenue growth, margin improvement and resilience in the face of legal, regulatory, economic and technological pressures.

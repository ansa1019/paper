The Company acknowledges that its operations and financial results are subject to a broad array of internal and external pressures—ranging from evolving healthcare, tax and anti-corruption regulations, data privacy requirements such as the EU’s GDPR, and extensive medical device rules to intense competitive dynamics, currency fluctuations, trade disputes, geopolitical instability and natural hazards—and has established a multifaceted set of resilience strategies and mechanisms to maintain system integrity and performance under disturbance.  These include comprehensive compliance and monitoring programs to mitigate legal and regulatory risks and associated costs, proactive cybersecurity measures and business continuity plans to address threats to key information technology systems, networks and third-party service providers, and a disciplined global enterprise resource planning implementation process with contingency arrangements to ensure operational flexibility and continuity.  The Company’s diversified manufacturing footprint, alternate sourcing protocols for sole-source components and centralized distribution centers are designed to absorb strain from site-specific disruptions, environmental hazards or supplier failures and to resume production rapidly while preserving product availability and customer service.  In its liquidity and capital allocation framework, the Company leverages substantial cash generation, credit facilities and commercial paper programs to maintain financial flexibility, fund strategic investments and acquisitions, support ongoing operations and respond to adverse conditions without compromising long-term objectives.  Prospective acquisitions and integrations—such as the planned Wright Medical transaction—are managed through detailed integration and reconfiguration roadmaps that anticipate potential delays, system challenges and personnel transitions, with ongoing assessment of synergies, restructuring charges and impairment indicators to preserve strategic agility.  The Company also maintains reserves for product liability, recall matters and uncertain tax positions, conducts regular impairment testing of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets when market or operational conditions change, and adjusts assumptions on cash flows, discount rates and growth projections as necessary.  Through these coordinated efforts—encompassing risk assessment, resource deployment, crisis response, adaptation strategies and continuous monitoring—the Company seeks to absorb strain, reconstitute and reconfigure its operational trajectories, and preserve or improve functioning in nominal, extreme or exceptional circumstances so as to survive, grow and flourish.

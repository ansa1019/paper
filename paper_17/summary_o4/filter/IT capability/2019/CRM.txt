Salesforce has adopted and continuously refines a suite of policies, processes and technical controls—including business and data governance policies, enhanced internal security controls, escalation procedures, board-level oversight and periodic briefings to executive management—to mitigate cyber-security threats, prevent, detect and remediate vulnerabilities and preserve the integrity of its cloud infrastructure and customer data.  To maintain operational flexibility and business continuity under nominal, extreme or exceptional internal and external disturbances—ranging from cyber-attacks, third-party service interruptions, hardware supply-chain constraints and evolving regulatory requirements to natural disasters, seismic events, climate-related risks and pandemics—the company replicates production environments and customer data in near real-time at geographically separate facilities, serves certain offerings through alternate sites, maintains disaster recovery and crisis management plans and allocates additional infrastructure capacity and professional services resources as needed.  Salesforce regularly invests in expanding data center capacity, scaling its headcount across development, operations and customer success, integrating acquired technologies, adapting to new accounting and reporting standards and evolving its regulatory and privacy compliance posture (including GDPR and CCPA readiness) to absorb strain, reconfigure its trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events and preserve or improve functioning and performance under challenging conditions, while acknowledging that no set of controls can provide absolute security or guarantee uninterrupted service.

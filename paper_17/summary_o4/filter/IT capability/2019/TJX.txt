The company’s opportunistic buying strategy, operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns, places significant discretion with merchants who are expected to effectively react to frequently changing market opportunities and trends, assess desirability and value, and determine how, when and from where to source merchandise in order to maintain customer traffic, sales and margins. To respond to customer demand and manage pricing and markdowns, the company must appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to individual stores, maintain the right mix and level of inventory in each store and flexibly allocate store space among product categories. The flexible off-price model is designed to help the company react to changing consumer trends and spending patterns. The company’s growth strategy, whether through expansion into new markets, product lines, channels or acquisitions, requires effective management of size and scale, appropriate internal resources and third-party providers across administration, merchandising, store operations, distribution, logistics and compliance, along with consistent implementation of systems, controls, practices and policies and effective information sharing across geographic regions. The company maintains policies, procedures and controls intended to safeguard its information technology systems—critical for planning, purchasing, sales, supply chain management, inventory management, e-commerce and other key operations—and invests in ongoing integrity, security, back-up systems and risk-mitigation measures, including data privacy and cybersecurity protections, to reduce the risk of disruptions, compromises or failures. In light of natural disasters, pandemics such as COVID-19, geopolitical or regulatory changes—such as Brexit, new tariffs or evolving trade policies—the company continues to monitor developments, evaluate possible extensions of operating restrictions, temporarily close and subsequently reopen stores, adjust staffing and supply chain strategies, realign its European division’s supply chain to reduce cross-border flows, draw down credit facilities, suspend share repurchases, reduce capital expenditures, and reconsider dividend programs, reflecting a dynamic focus on cash preservation, capital allocation and financial flexibility. The company routinely enters into inventory-related and fuel hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, commodity price changes and transportation costs on merchandise margins and operating results, and maintains a forecasting process to plan sales, align expenses, and adjust costs to actual results. The company evaluates long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when conditions indicate potential recoverability issues, and it assesses uncertain tax positions, contingent liabilities, legal and regulatory developments to ensure that reserves and compliance measures remain appropriate. Through these initiatives—ranging from opportunistic sourcing and inventory management to risk identification, resource generation, reconfiguration of operations and strategic foresight—the company seeks to maintain business continuity, preserve functioning under adverse conditions and position itself to emerge resiliently from disruptive events.

Our operating environment is subject to significant external pressures – including economic downturns, political unrest, extreme weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics such as COVID-19, and sudden travel restrictions – which can unpredictably disrupt consumer demand, partner relationships and cash flows, and require us to reconfigure operational resources, working arrangements (such as remote work in high-risk areas) and customer support processes for cancellations, refunds and rebookings. We have experienced capacity constraints, system failures and denial-of-service attacks that necessitate redundant hosting, data center expansion and contingency planning, although our business interruption coverage is limited. We have adapted our payment model by expanding merchant transactions to facilitate payments on behalf of customers, at the cost of increased payment processing, fraud prevention and customer relations expenses. Marketing efficiency and profitability trends have driven us to calibrate performance and brand marketing spend based on return-on-investment, channel mix shifts and cancellation rates. Rapid geographic expansion and acquisitions, including the integration of new brands, have required more inter-brand cooperation, shared systems investments and compliance with diverse regulatory regimes (such as GDPR, CCPA, digital services taxes, price parity and consumer protection commitments), as well as adaptation to local market conditions, tax policies and legal requirements. Our ongoing investments in technology (such as mobile platforms, enterprise resource planning, cloud computing and payment solutions), expansion of our property base (including alternative accommodations) and efforts to build an integrated “connected trip” offering are intended to enhance organizational flexibility, maintain customer satisfaction and preserve firm performance under challenging conditions.

Nike’s Form 10-K discloses an extensive array of internal and external pressures demanding organizational resilience, including “business disruptions” such as interruptions in data and information technology systems and “extreme weather conditions and natural disasters,” the risk of supply chain and manufacturing delays if major independent contract manufacturers sever or alter relationships, and the constant challenge of “difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining Nike’s increasingly complex information technology systems” required for demand and supply planning, inventory control and digital commerce. The company underscores its need for operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation through technical innovation, research and development and significant investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and new enterprise resource planning tools to adjust product offerings, preserve or improve inventory and respond effectively to environmental disruptions and fluctuations in consumer demand. Nike describes its centrally managed foreign currency hedging and cash flow hedges as resilience mechanisms for transactional and translational exposures, maintains business interruption insurance for its global distribution facilities and relies on crisis management and contingency planning to ensure operational continuity. Recognizing that “new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks,” Nike frames its resilience approach around proactive risk assessment, strategic initiatives, organizational change processes and crisis response planning to maintain performance, preserve competitive advantage and sustain growth under challenging conditions.

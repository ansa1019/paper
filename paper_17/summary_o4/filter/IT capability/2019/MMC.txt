The company emphasizes that its “business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner,” noting strategic initiatives with technology partners and infrastructure investments to support growth, even as such investments may require significant capital, resource allocation and carry execution risks. It recognizes the critical need for the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store sensitive data, yet acknowledges vulnerabilities in its own and third-party control systems to unauthorized access, damage or interruption from external and internal threats, including increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, computer viruses, ransomware, social engineering and advanced persistent threats. Measures to enhance security—such as data encryption, heightened monitoring and multi-factor authentication—are noted as time- and resource-intensive, potentially untimely or ineffective, and may not fully protect data across diverse systems, underscoring the latency and detection challenges of breaches. The company details business continuity risks—earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, pandemics, security breaches, power or telecommunications failures—and warns that local or regional disasters or cyber events could cause operational challenges, data loss or interruption of client services, requiring the availability of personnel, facilities and properly functioning systems for recovery. Although it “regularly assess[es] and take[s] steps to improve our existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession,” it concedes that a significant event or failure to recover could materially interrupt operations, result in financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability, and that business disruption insurance may not fully cover recovery costs. In the context of acquisitions, it highlights the complexity and risks of integrating acquired entities’ information systems, potential unidentified vulnerabilities that could expose its own systems to cyberattack, and ongoing exposure until integration is complete. It further identifies the necessity of attracting, developing and retaining talent capable of detecting, mitigating and remediating these risks, fostering a culture of integrity and responsiveness, and devoting time and resources to training, professional development and non-billable activities, while contending with intense competition for talent. The company also underscores that extensive and evolving regulatory obligations—data privacy, cybersecurity, reporting and other legal requirements—demand significant resources, time and adaptation, and that failure to comply or to respond effectively to legislative and regulatory developments may impair its ability to offer products and services, increase costs and expose it to enforcement actions. Finally, it affirms that its ability to compete, sustain growth and maintain functioning under challenging conditions hinges on its capacity to respond effectively to digital disruption, technological change, market volatility and external pressures, to forecast demand, transition resources efficiently, preserve operational flexibility and implement resilience strategies that support continuity, adaptability and recovery.

In 2017, the company experienced a network cyber-attack that led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations, and in response it implemented a variety of measures to further enhance and modernize its systems to guard against similar attacks in the future and is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to enhance the company’s resiliency against future cyber-attacks, including incidents similar to the 2017 attack, with the objective not only to protect against future cyber-attacks, but also to improve the speed of the company’s recovery from such attacks and enable continued business operations to the greatest extent possible during any recovery period; it monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of company IT systems to reduce these risks on an ongoing basis, but acknowledges that such protections may not prevent disruptions that could result in loss of revenue, loss of critical or sensitive information and substantial remediation costs. The company manages foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through financial instruments—including purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, purchased collar options, currency-denominated debt designated as net-investment hedges and pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts—to reduce the variability of future cash flows and mitigate balance-sheet exposures, and it maintains investment guidelines that limit credit exposure and ensure diversification. In early 2019, the company approved a new global restructuring program designed to optimize its manufacturing and supply network and reduce its global real estate footprint, expecting to incur approximately $2.5 billion of pretax costs by 2023 and to realize annual net cost savings of approximately $900 million thereafter through workforce reductions, accelerated depreciation and facility closures. The company also maintains contingency plans and accrued reserves for risks arising from global economic and geopolitical uncertainties—including Brexit scenarios, natural or man-made disasters and environmental liabilities under superfund regulations—believing its accruals and remediation plans are adequate to support business continuity and preserve its performance under adverse internal or external conditions.

We operate globally in highly interdependent capital and commodities markets where general economic conditions and volatility—driven by negative or uncertain political conditions, natural and man-made disasters, or outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases—introduce volatility and uncertainty into our markets and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to continue to operate depends in part on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunications and other related systems and operations, and should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, our inability to successfully recover could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability. We rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors and on network systems and the Internet to deliver many of our products and services electronically; breaches of our or our vendors’ systems—whether from cyber attacks, hacking, malware, employee error or malfeasance—may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors’ websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of information, which could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation and regulatory actions, and lead to loss of customer confidence. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our technology assets and to improve our disaster recovery plans and key management succession, there is no assurance that these measures will provide absolute security or full resilience. Outsourcing certain aspects of our business to third-party service providers and cloud infrastructure increases the risk that these providers may not perform to our standards, may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards, or may fail to perform at all, which could result in disruptions, increased costs, regulatory penalties and reputational harm. Moreover, evolving legislative, regulatory and commercial environments—including expanding privacy, cybersecurity and data protection requirements—along with rapid technological change, competitive pressures, and the challenges of integrating acquisitions and new strategic initiatives underscore the importance of our capacity to absorb strain, adapt processes and reallocate resources to maintain system integrity, preserve performance, and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

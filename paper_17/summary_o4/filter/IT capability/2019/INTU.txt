The company acknowledges that its ability to maintain operations and positive adjustment under challenging conditions depends upon investments in business continuity and risk mitigation across its systems and processes. In its Risk Factors, it discloses that “business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services,” that it does not have redundancy for all of its systems, and that its “disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities.” It further notes that its operations, data centers, networks and third-party service providers are vulnerable to natural disasters, cyberattacks, human error and other disruptions, and that such failures could lead to “lost revenues and increased expenses,” reputational harm, customer loss and operational setbacks. The company describes continuous investments to “update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms,” to develop “skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies,” and to enhance “network security and high-availability capabilities,” while acknowledging that “prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture” could impair service delivery and its competitive position. It highlights the seasonality of its tax business, which “must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods,” and the risk that it may be “unable to maintain adequate service levels during these peak periods,” potentially harming financial results. The firm also details its reliance on internal review and approval processes, supply-chain partners and third-party relationships to manage risks related to cybersecurity, data privacy and intellectual property, yet concedes that technological change, evolving regulations and the need for continual innovation may strain its resource allocation, expose it to integration challenges, and require adaptive organizational practices. Finally, in discussing acquisitions and divestitures, it stresses the importance of its ability to “integrate the acquired technology, data assets and operations,” “realize synergies,” maintain uniform standards and controls, and reconfigure its resource deployment and organizational practices to preserve performance and resilience in a dynamic business environment.

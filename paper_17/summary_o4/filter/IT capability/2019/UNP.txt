In managing fluctuations in demand for our services and network capacity, we continuously enhance our transportation plan, add capacity, improve yard and facility operations, and maintain adequate resources to address surges and potential service shortcomings. Our implementation of Unified Plan 2020 exemplifies a systemic approach to reconfigure network operations by consolidating terminals, reducing variability, optimizing asset utilization and workforce productivity, and improving service reliability under both nominal and severe weather conditions. Despite significant weather events, cybersecurity incidents, regulatory and labor uncertainties, and environmental challenges, we remain focused on risk assessment, multi-faceted safety programs, data-driven detection and mitigation of rail defects, and targeted capital investments—including track infrastructure renewal, facility expansions, and technology modernization—to preserve operational continuity and performance. We have established an operating practices command center to identify causes of service interruptions and develop solutions, and we allocate resources toward longer train lengths, fewer “car touches,” and strategic facility rationalization to improve agility and responsiveness. Our capital and liquidity plans leverage internal cash flow, receivables securitization, credit facilities, and disciplined debt management to maintain financial flexibility, while ongoing investments in fuel-efficiency training, environmental remediation, and alternative energy initiatives reflect our commitment to sustainability. These measures collectively strengthen our ability to absorb strain, adapt to external pressures such as market volatility, regulatory change, and extreme conditions, and maintain positive adjustment and long-term organizational health.

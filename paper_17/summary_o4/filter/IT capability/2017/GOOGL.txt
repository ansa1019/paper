The Company discloses that its “operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties,” including intense competition and rapidly evolving technologies and user needs, which require it to “continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use,” and to “accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner.” It further warns that failures in innovation responsiveness, timing, or effective market launches “could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock.” In managing its supply chain and ensuring operational continuity, the Company notes reliance on third-party manufacturers and limited‐source components “which could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions” and acknowledges that “some of our data centers are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities.” On information security, it recognizes that its IT and communications systems are “vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the effects of climate change, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems” and commits that “we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain state-of-the-art security protections that shield against theft and security breaches,” while admitting that “we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.” The report also acknowledges regulatory and legal pressures requiring “changes to our business practices,” emphasizes the need to maintain its corporate culture and “retain highly skilled personnel” to support continued “innovation, creativity, and teamwork,” and describes its liquidity and capital structure—comprising cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, a commercial paper program, and a revolving credit facility—as critical to preserving “business continuity,” absorbing strain, reallocating resources, and preserving or improving functioning amid internal or external disturbances.

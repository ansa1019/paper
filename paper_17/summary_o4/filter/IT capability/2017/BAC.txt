Bank of America has established an enterprise‐wide risk framework and risk appetite statement, approved by its Board and overseen by management committees, which guide resource allocation and strategic decision‐making to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions. The organization employs detailed contingency plans—including a capital contingency plan, a contingency funding plan and a recovery plan—and its Single Point of Entry resolution strategy to ensure operating continuity or an orderly wind‐down of subsidiaries under severe stress. These plans define monitoring, escalation and response routines to increase capital, secure diverse funding sources, de-risk portfolios and reconfigure the balance sheet as needed, supported by a substantial pool of Global Liquidity Sources and a stable deposit franchise. Operational resilience is further reinforced by redundant backup systems, safeguards to support third‐party dependencies, cybersecurity and business continuity programs, robust compliance, operational and reputational risk governance, regular stress testing, and post‐stress recovery exercises. Within the banking book, derivatives are used to hedge the variability in cash flows and fair values arising from interest rate and foreign currency risk, and in mortgage banking the firm hedges interest rate lock commitments, loans held for sale and mortgage servicing rights to mitigate prepayment and spread risk. Through these integrated measures—and periodic capital scenario management, stress forecasting, and ongoing enhancements to systems and controls—the firm continuously adapts to unexpected situations and maintains performance and system integrity under challenging conditions.

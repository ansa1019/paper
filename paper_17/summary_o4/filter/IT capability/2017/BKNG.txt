The company recognizes that macro-economic downturns, political uncertainties such as Brexit or sovereign-debt crises, and unforeseen events—including oil-price shocks, stock-market volatility, natural disasters, pandemics, terrorist attacks and regulatory restrictions—can unpredictably disrupt travel demand and dramatically affect its operations, and it therefore maintains redundant systems and hosting services, allocates resources to expand data-center capacity, invests in disaster recovery planning (noting that recovery plans and business-interruption insurance may be inadequate in some regions) and secures contingency arrangements with third-party distribution and payment partners. It acknowledges that system capacity constraints, “denial-of-service” attacks, phishing, SQL injection and other security breaches pose risks of service interruptions, reputational harm and potential liabilities, and accordingly expends significant resources on information-security measures, backup systems and allowances for customer chargebacks and tax exposures. Expansion into multiple jurisdictions has increased operational complexity, placing additional strain on management, technical performance, financial resources and internal controls, and the company therefore continues to invest in personnel recruitment, training and retention, in adapting its services and platforms to rapidly changing technologies and mobile-commerce trends, and in performance and brand advertising to sustain consumer demand. The firm further notes that its future success depends on ongoing innovation and improvement of its technologies and processes, effective inter-organizational collaboration with travel-service and restaurant partners, adjustments to evolving regulatory and competitive landscapes, and the ability to reconfigure resources and organizational structures to preserve performance, continuity and growth under varying internal and external pressures.

In its Risk Factors discussion, the company acknowledges that its business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by internal or external pressures, underscoring the need to maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and brand extensions sufficient to cover substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues lost upon expiration of intellectual property protection; accordingly, it manages R&D spending across its portfolio so that delays or terminations of individual projects will not materially alter total investment, preserving operational flexibility and enabling resource reconfiguration in response to project‐level uncertainties. Outsourcing of product development, manufacturing, and distribution to third parties introduces performance and confidentiality risks, for which the company retains oversight and contractual safeguards to preserve manufacturing and service continuity. The firm employs a controlled risk‐management program, including interest rate and foreign currency hedging, to limit the impact of market rate fluctuations on earnings, cash flows, and financial position, and maintains access to commercial paper markets and committed credit facilities to ensure business continuity. It establishes provisions for sales returns, rebates, and discounts at the time of sale based on historical return rates and channel inventories to absorb stocking and destocking variability; regularly reviews long‐lived asset carrying values for impairment when circumstances change; and accrues reserves for product liability and other contingencies using probability‐weighted assessments to mitigate legal and regulatory hazards. Recognizing the criticality of IT systems and confidential information, the company has implemented measures to prevent, detect, respond to, and minimize cyber‐attack and system failure risks. In response to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it recorded provisional deferred tax adjustments and a one‐time toll tax payable over eight years, and intends to deploy the resulting liquidity across capital investments, business development, debt reduction, and shareholder returns, thereby strengthening its financial resilience. The firm continues to monitor economic conditions, customer creditworthiness, health care legislation, and international funding levels to anticipate potential disruptions and maintain organizational adaptability, resource sufficiency, and continuity under challenging conditions.

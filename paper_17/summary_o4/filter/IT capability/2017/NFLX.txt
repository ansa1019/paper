Netflix has implemented systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect its data and systems, recognizing that any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to its computer systems or those of third parties could result in a loss or degradation of service and thereby harm its business; it has built its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) alongside third-party cloud computing services to efficiently stream high volumes of content and continually refines and revises its systems and operational practices to manage the growing complexity and scale of its streaming service and original content production, adapting to varied content offerings, consumer customs and legal and regulatory environments across domestic and international markets; it enters into multi-year fixed-cost streaming content commitments, which, while largely fixed in nature, require careful resource allocation, forecasting and liquidity management—including analysis of free cash flow, use of debt financing and a revolving credit facility—to absorb financial strain and preserve operational functionality in the face of membership growth rate fluctuations; it continually adds new memberships to replace cancellations and invests in marketing and partnership diversity to sustain competitive advantage and business continuity; it monitors and adjusts its technology, development and general corporate infrastructure to support strategic initiatives and risk mitigation, including disaster recovery measures for natural disasters, power loss, cybersecurity risks and regulatory changes; and it undertakes cross-jurisdictional tax planning, deferred tax asset valuation and provisional accounting under new legislation to reconfigure its financial resources, all reflecting an organizational capability to adapt trajectories toward disruptive events, reconstitute operations in immediate response to adversity and reconfigure resources for future resilience, thereby maintaining service integrity, performance and growth under challenging conditions.

Our annual report discloses that our cybersecurity and processing systems, as well as those of our financial institution clients, merchants and third-party service providers, may experience damage or disruption from causes ranging from power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, viruses, malware and manual errors to cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, and that errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in our information technology infrastructure and processing systems could significantly disrupt our operations, impact our clients and consumers, damage our reputation, give rise to litigation, result in violations of privacy or other laws, and prove costly, time-consuming and difficult to remedy. We caution that, in the event of damage or disruption to our business, we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets and data through our business continuity program. To mitigate these risks, we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity programs, have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, and maintain insurance and controls designed to manage settlement, credit and liquidity risks. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, maintain committed sources of funding including a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $3.0 billion commercial paper program, and adhere to policies limiting our credit exposure to any one financial institution or investment type. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with evolving regulations and laws, and we continually enhance these programs, although we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all regulatory authorities. We also highlight that failures to anticipate, adapt to or keep pace with rapid technological changes in the payments industry, or to integrate acquired systems seamlessly—such as during the migration of Visa Europe activity onto VisaNet’s systems—could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services, and impair the experience of consumers using our products globally.

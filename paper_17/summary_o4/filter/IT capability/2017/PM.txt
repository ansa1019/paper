Philip Morris International discloses that it maintains backup systems and business-continuity plans to protect its information systems and data, recognizing that system failures or cyber intrusions could disrupt operations, impair competitiveness and require significant remediation, litigation or regulatory actions. The company acknowledges that its global footprint exposes it to economic, political, regulatory and natural‐disaster risks that can interrupt its supply chain, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, lead to loss of critical assets and personnel, and necessitate replacing third-party contract manufacturers with internal resources. It further identifies that adverse currency movements, tax law changes and evolving regulatory requirements—particularly those affecting reduced-risk products—could materially impact profitability and market position, and thus it pursues strategic initiatives such as product innovation, brand portfolio diversification through selective acquisitions and business partnerships, targeted resource allocation toward smoke-free technologies, and engagement in science-based regulatory frameworks. These forward-looking plans and assumptions, including tax-planning measures under the 2017 U.S. tax reform and currency hedging consideration, are designed to absorb financial and market strains, preserve performance and reconfigure operations in response to external pressures, thereby supporting the maintenance of organizational functioning and competitive advantage under challenging conditions.

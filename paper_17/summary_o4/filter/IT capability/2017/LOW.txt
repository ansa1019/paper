We have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business, and our risk management framework, administered by our chief financial officer, includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify. We recognize that adapting our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address changing shopping habits, demands and demographics is critical to our future success and that failure to identify such trends, adapt our business concept, and implement change, growth and productivity initiatives could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, our market share and results of operations. Our strategic initiatives focused on omni-channel sales and marketing presence require us to deliver large, complex programs requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing, and demand new competencies in many positions so that our management, employees and contractors can adapt and learn new skills and capabilities; to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access. We invest in customer-facing technology systems and disaster recovery plans but acknowledge that performance issues, temporary outages caused by cyber-attacks or complete system failures without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide and negatively affect perceptions of Loweâ€™s as a reliable online vendor. We rely on our domestic and international supply chain, fulfillment network and third-party service providers, and any disruptions in fulfillment operations, trade policy changes, vendor failures, political or labor unrest, natural disasters or pandemics could negatively impact our business by causing delays in inventory, increased delivery costs or out-of-stocks. Our cybersecurity programs and investments in information security are designed to protect customer, employee, vendor and company information and to comply with evolving data privacy and cybersecurity laws, yet we cannot guarantee prevention of breaches that could result in unauthorized access, data unavailability, business interruptions and material adverse effects on our reputation, financial condition and business continuity. We also recognize that our ability to hire, train, manage and retain qualified sales associates, specialists and corporate staff with expanded skill sets is essential to executing our strategic initiatives and adapting our business concept; failure to do so could lead to loss of sales and increased costs. Strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and integrations, involve risks of disruption of our ongoing business, complexity in financial systems and internal controls and diversion of management attention, and we have committed resources to integrate personnel, processes and systems to secure the benefits of these transactions. Our continued focus on leveraging analytics to know the customer better, expanding fulfillment options, delivering compelling product experiences, improving pro and DIFM offerings, and empowering associates through enhanced tools and training reflects our commitment to build the capabilities required to deliver simple and seamless omni-channel experiences for DIY, DIFM and pro customers, ensure operational flexibility, and preserve or improve functioning despite external pressures, environmental turbulence and other unexpected challenges.

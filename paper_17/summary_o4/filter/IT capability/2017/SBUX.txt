We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment where new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, and if any of the risks and uncertainties described actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  Our success depends substantially on preserving the value of our brands and business continuity through consistent product quality, service innovation and monitoring of licensee and joint-venture operations, with failure to respond appropriately to incidents such as breaches of privacy, contamination, recalls or negative publicity capable of significantly reducing brand value and impairing firm performance.  We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, and if our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability, operational flexibility and financial results.  Any material interruption in our supply chain—for example, due to casualty loss at roasting plants, interruptions in service by logistics providers, trade restrictions, natural disasters or reliance on suppliers in regions with diminished infrastructure—could negatively impact our ability to produce or deliver products and our profitability, requiring adaptive resource allocation and risk mitigation strategies.  We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or managing growth—including disciplined global expansion, supply chain scaling, digital and loyalty platform development, new store formats, channel development and a shift between company-owned and licensed stores—which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results if unexpected market conditions, construction delays, supply constraints, licensee capital limitations or customer acceptance issues arise.  We face intense competition and external pressures in each of our channels and markets, and our performance under pressure is sensitive to economic conditions, currency fluctuations, regulatory changes, geopolitical events, natural or man-made disasters and health pandemics that may lead to reduced customer traffic or temporary closures, requiring ongoing adaptability and operational continuity measures.  In response to underperforming assets or shifts in consumer demand, we record restructuring and impairment charges, as in our Teavana and Switzerland businesses, to reconfigure resources, preserve system integrity and maintain performance under challenging conditions.  We manage commodity price risk—particularly for high-quality Arabica coffee and dairy products—through pricing features embedded in supply contracts and the use of financial derivatives, and we hedge foreign currency and interest rate exposures to reduce volatility in cash flows and maintain investment capacity for long-term resilience.  Our capital deployment strategy, including disciplined investments in new and existing stores, supply chain and corporate facilities, share repurchases, dividends and joint-venture acquisitions such as the pending full ownership of our East China partner, reflects our ability to reconstitute trajectories toward future growth, sustain operational strength and emerge stronger from adversity.

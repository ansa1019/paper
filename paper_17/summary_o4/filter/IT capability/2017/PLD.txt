Our risk disclosures emphasize measures designed to preserve functioning and maintain integrity under adverse conditions, including “system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan” for our information technology systems to guard against energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks. To absorb strain from currency volatility and financing disruptions, we “attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts,” recognizing that such efforts may not always succeed. We pursue geographic diversification, rigorous market research and asset management capabilities to adapt to local economic perturbations and maintain business continuity, and we carry earthquake, hurricane and flood hazard insurance—subject to coverage limitations and deductibles—that is evaluated annually in light of current industry practice. Acknowledging that “real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets,” we plan for constrained access to capital markets and potential disruptions in financing by considering alternative liquidity sources—such as property dispositions, adjusted leasing strategies and debt funding—to preserve operational flexibility and sustain performance under pressure. We also continually review the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting to mitigate errors and support positive adjustment across our global operations.

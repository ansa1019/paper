Amgen’s 2017 Form 10-K discloses multiple resilience-related practices that underscore its ability to maintain operations and preserve performance under adverse conditions. The company acknowledges that “a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities” are concentrated at its Puerto Rico facility and that “significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products,” yet reports that when Hurricane Maria struck in September 2017 “the critical manufacturing areas of our…facility were not significantly impacted by the storm, and we have now resumed our full manufacturing operations,” initially relying on “back-up diesel-powered generators” and arranging “deliveries of both gases from the U.S. mainland and other countries” to address shortages of medical-grade oxygen and nitrogen. Despite hardships faced by staff, some of whom were “forced or elect[ed] to temporarily or permanently relocate,” the site’s rapid recovery demonstrates organizational flexibility and resource reconfiguration in response to extreme conditions. Since 2014, Amgen has executed “transformation and process improvement efforts across the company,” reallocating resources toward innovation and realizing approximately $1.5 billion in savings while investing in “next-generation biomanufacturing” that “dramatically reduces the scale and costs of making biologics while retaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines.” Financial risk mitigation is addressed through an investment portfolio structured to “enhance overall returns…while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk,” foreign currency hedging to offset exchange-rate fluctuations, interest rate swaps for debt mix optimization and cross-currency swaps on foreign-denominated obligations. The report further highlights supply-chain risk management, noting reliance on “unaffiliated third-party suppliers” for proprietary raw materials and the essential role of “our distribution and logistics centers,” and cautions that “manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.” These disclosures collectively reflect Amgen’s systemic perspective on resilience, encompassing disruption prevention, rapid recovery processes and strategic resource deployment to preserve organizational functioning under pressure.

Lockheed Martin underscores in its risk factors that it “seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted,” recognizing that costs in excess of contract‐funding obligations may place it at risk for reimbursement delays or shortfalls and that U.S. government appropriations on a fiscal‐year basis require ongoing funding reviews and mitigation strategies. To preserve its stability under program cuts or budget shifts, the company relies on a diverse portfolio of defense, homeland security and IT products and services to reduce the likelihood that reductions in any single program will have a long‐term effect on its operations. It proactively notifies customers when estimated costs approach authorized levels to sustain contract continuity and employs continuous oversight of complex programs such as the F-35 to address performance, schedule and cost challenges. Lockheed Martin also manages legal and regulatory pressures through robust compliance programs in government contracting and industrial cooperation (“offset”) agreements, and it maintains a balanced cash deployment strategy—supporting operations, capital expenditures, debt service, postretirement benefit contributions and share repurchases—to sustain financial flexibility under uncertain conditions. Its enterprise risk management framework includes threat detection, cyber‐security mitigation plans and oversight of information‐technology systems to defend against evolving cyber and other security threats, while its use of foreign‐currency and interest‐rate derivatives hedges market fluctuations. Supply‐chain resilience is emphasized through active management of over 16,000 direct suppliers, transition planning for subcontractor deficiencies and contracting safeguards to address performance shortfalls. Finally, the company forecasts and funds postretirement benefit plan obligations under cost accounting standards, manages environmental remediation liabilities through regulatory agreements and recovery receivables, and continually evaluates contingent liabilities to ensure its ability to absorb external disturbances and maintain essential operations under adverse or unexpected circumstances.

We maintain a comprehensive risk management and business continuity framework designed to support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including a corporate compliance program to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of policies, systems and a culture of compliance; ongoing monitoring of payor mix, rebate, chargeback and discount estimates, inventory levels in the distribution channel and reserves for returns to adapt revenue recognition and cost of goods sold as market and reimbursement conditions evolve; diversification of our research and development pipeline through strategic collaborations, in-licensing and targeted asset acquisitions to balance the risks inherent in drug discovery across multiple therapeutic areas; allocation of substantial financial resources to support research, development and commercial infrastructure while maintaining a revolving credit facility and forecasting cash flows from product sales to ensure funding for at least the next twelve months; reliance on a global network of third-party manufacturers with contractual arrangements and contingency planning to mitigate supply chain disruptions; routine reassessment of intangible assets and contingent payment liabilities based on clinical and nonclinical program data to reconfigure development priorities; and implementation of disaster recovery plans, information technology security measures and insurance programs to safeguard our facilities, data and operations against internal or external variations and disturbances.

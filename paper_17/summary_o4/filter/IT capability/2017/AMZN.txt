Our disclosures acknowledge that our rapid global expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions “places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions,” and that we “may not be able to manage growth effectively,” which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. We face intense competitive and environmental pressures, including supply‐chain disruptions due to inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, and acts of God, as well as risks of system interruptions arising from inadequate software and hardware capacity, insufficient redundancy, and potentially inadequate disaster recovery planning. Our dependence on a limited number of shipping carriers, third‐party fulfillment and customer‐service providers, and external technology vendors increases our exposure to unexpected disruptions and may impede our business continuity. Seasonality, inventory forecasting uncertainties, and the growing complexity of our fulfillment networks may further impair our operational flexibility and performance under pressure. In our management’s discussion and analysis, we describe ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, fulfillment capabilities, internal‐use software and website development, and process improvements intended to improve efficiency, reduce variable and fixed costs, and achieve high inventory velocity so that we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We emphasize our focus on generating long‐term, sustainable free cash flows by efficiently managing working capital and cash capital expenditures, optimizing resource allocation through commercial partnerships and acquisitions, and maintaining adequate liquidity and debt capacity to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under adversity, and maintain system integrity and performance amid internal or external disturbances, while noting that our forward‐looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to fluctuations in global economic conditions, customer demand, foreign exchange rates, and the timing and success of our strategic initiatives.

The report describes an enterprise risk management framework designed to support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by defining risk appetite, assigning clear accountability and governance through a Global Risk Committee and specialized sub-committees for compliance, financial, operational and model risk, and embedding policies and procedures for risk identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting and mitigation. Operational resilience is reinforced through backup and recovery infrastructure, geographically dispersed workforces, routine business continuity and disaster-recovery testing, robust information-security controls, third-party risk management protocols and fiduciary safeguards. Credit, market and liquidity risks are managed via collateral requirements, credit limits, net interest revenue simulation and sensitivity analyses, maturity and repricing guidelines, high-quality liquid asset buffers, committed funding lines, stress testing and contingency funding and capital plans to ensure ongoing capital adequacy, including well-capitalized regulatory ratios, dividend continuity and access to diversified external financing. Capital management includes regular stress testing of balance-sheet and capital positions, internal capital contingency frameworks, and proactive transfers of excess subsidiary capital. Collectively, these integrated strategies, controls and planning processes aim to preserve system integrity, operational continuity and financial strength—and to reconfigure trajectories in response to external disturbances—thereby sustaining the organization’s functioning and performance under a wide range of adverse scenarios.

The semiconductor capital equipment industry’s inherent variability and periods of rapid growth or decline require us to continuously reassess strategic resource allocation decisions, adjust spending and infrastructure, and timely size our supply chain, workforce, financial and business controls, and information systems to preserve operational continuity under changing business environments. During fluctuations in demand we deploy cost management programs to align expenditures with anticipated revenue streams while still investing in research and development and maintaining extensive global customer service and support capabilities, recognizing that failure to adapt appropriately can result in excess fixed costs or impaired gross margins. We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves and monitor cash flows to support anticipated operations, investments, debt service, capital expenditures, and dividends, yet acknowledge that future revenues and our ability to manage costs will critically affect our capacity to sustain performance under uncertainty. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly due to factors beyond our control—including supply disruptions, regulatory changes, economic or political conditions, and natural or man-made disasters—and we have established emergency recovery processes and hedging strategies to mitigate such interruptions. We rely on ISO 27001-compliant security procedures, intrusion prevention systems, and access controls to protect our critical information systems from cybersecurity threats and ensure business continuity. With over 90% of revenue generated internationally, we face unpredictable global economic, political, and trade disruptions and therefore invest in local supplier relationships, compliance measures, and foreign currency hedges to maintain service continuity and adapt to regional requirements. We periodically evaluate acquisitions, dispositions, and outsourcing arrangements, manage integration and supplier concentration risks, and, where feasible, establish alternative sources to avoid operational disruptions. Through these measures—ranging from risk mitigation and contingency planning to ongoing investments in people, processes, and technology—we strive to preserve our organizational capabilities, adaptability, and performance despite external pressures and environmental turbulence.

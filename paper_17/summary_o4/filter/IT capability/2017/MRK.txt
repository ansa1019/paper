Merck’s disclosures describe how the company has responded to extreme disruptions—including the June 2017 global cyber-attack that halted research, manufacturing and sales operations and Hurricane Maria’s landfall on its Puerto Rico plant—by implementing enterprise-wide measures to enhance its cyber defenses, monitor and remediate IT threats, secure insurance coverage, diversify power and water sources, and deploy alternative manufacturing arrangements to enable continued order fulfillment and rapid operational recovery. In the wake of these events, the company borrowed vaccine doses from the U.S. strategic stockpile and later replenished them, invested in capital projects and a $6 billion credit facility for liquidity support, and employs revenue and balance-sheet hedging programs to protect foreign-currency cash flows, thereby preserving business continuity under adverse conditions. Recognizing ongoing global economic, regulatory and supply-chain pressures, Merck has pursued restructuring and consolidation of facilities, optimized its manufacturing and distribution network, reallocated resources into strategic R&D collaborations and external innovation alliances, and instituted dynamic risk-mitigation tactics—ranging from inventory buffering to contingent consideration arrangements—to absorb strain, maintain critical processes, and sustain firm performance when confronted with unexpected events such as natural disasters, cyber intrusions, pricing reforms and political instability.

The company acknowledges that “system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities,” recognizing the potential for its manufacturing and logistics operations to be “disrupted for a variety of reasons including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.” It notes that “should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company’s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers,” and that “in the event of a natural disaster, the company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.” The company describes its reliance on outsourcing partners and acknowledges that diminished control “reduces the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions,” while rapid technology and market volatility create “a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products,” requiring estimation of “necessary cancellation fee reserves.” It further highlights that “the company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data,” but that “these measures cannot provide absolute security” and that “losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur.” The company also recognizes that “war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions” can “cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy,” that “an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company’s business and harm to the company’s reputation,” and that it “has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations,” while recording “write-downs for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand,” reflecting its efforts to mitigate risks and preserve operational integrity.

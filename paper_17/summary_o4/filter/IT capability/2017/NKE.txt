Nike’s annual report contains numerous disclosures reflecting its capacity to absorb strain and maintain functioning under adverse conditions, in line with the notion of organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.” The Company highlights its futures ordering program, which “allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price,” thereby minimizing inventory risk and “the risk of non-delivery.” It also underscores the central management of foreign exchange risk through hedging activities that “lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations,” as well as currency-neutral reporting to enhance visibility of business trends excluding translation impacts. The report identifies “business disruptions” from natural disasters, “interruptions in data and information technology systems” and cybersecurity threats as material risks to operational continuity, and notes that “if the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results … could be materially adversely affected.” To address such disruptions, Nike maintains business interruption insurance, invests in business continuity plans and robust internal controls, and commits to ongoing investments in advanced information technology systems across its supply chain to “increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market.” Liquidity resilience is supported by diversified cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a $2 billion credit facility, a commercial paper program and proactive tax planning and financing strategies, reflecting an adaptive resource-allocation framework intended to preserve financial integrity and performance under unexpected market volatility and external perturbations.

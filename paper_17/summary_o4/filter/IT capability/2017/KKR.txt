KKR discloses that it “relies heavily on its financial, accounting and other data processing systems and on the systems of third parties,” acknowledging that “if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, the firm could suffer financial loss, a disruption of its businesses, liability to its funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage,” and that its “business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption.” It describes its operational controls and risk management in trade execution, confirmation and settlement, its ongoing review of information systems and technology to support growth and new products, and efforts to address security threats including cyber-attacks and data privacy requirements. KKR further details risk assessment and mitigation strategies for its credit, hedging and financing activities to manage market stress while maintaining liquidity from committed capital facilities and a diversified funding base, and it highlights governance and compliance structures designed to enforce confidentiality, restrictive covenants and indemnifications, and to adapt to evolving regulatory demands. These measures, together with cross-functional collaboration across investment, legal, compliance and operations teams and targeted resource allocation, constitute its structured approach to contingency planning and organizational flexibility, aiming to preserve critical functions, maintain continuity and reconfigure operations under challenging economic, market or regulatory conditions.

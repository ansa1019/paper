Our annual report describes the company’s efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by devoting continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. We recognize that our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by intense competition, rapid technological change, consolidation among competitors, reimbursement pressures, political and economic uncertainties (including Brexit), regulatory unpredictability, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and disruptions in the supply of critical materials and contract sterilization services. To mitigate these risks, we have implemented resilience strategies such as restructuring and optimization initiatives—including strengthening global infrastructure, evolving real estate assets, simplifying plant structures, transferring production lines and expanding operational efficiencies—to enhance our growth potential and long-term success. We maintain diversified liquidity sources through cash and equivalents, commercial paper and credit facilities, accounts receivable factoring programs and prudent treasury management to preserve operational continuity under adverse economic conditions. Our growth and adaptation also rely on successful integration of acquisitions, coordination of manufacturing, research and development, sales and marketing across geographies, cultures and languages, and proactive risk assessment of legal, product liability, cybersecurity and intellectual property contingencies. We continuously monitor financial, legal and regulatory developments to reconfigure resource allocation, adjust strategic initiatives and preserve organizational health and system integrity, thereby enabling the company to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and emerge stronger in an environment of ongoing external pressures, environmental turbulence and business disruptions.

The Company recognizes that “the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters” and other catastrophic events are “inherently unpredictable” and could “adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition,” yet it “attempts to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls, risk models, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance.”  It further “seeks to manage our loss exposure by maintaining a disciplined underwriting process,” including writing contracts “on an excess of loss basis,” limiting program size, acquiring “third-party reinsurance,” and employing “geographic diversification” to preserve performance under varying pressures.  Acknowledging that “our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address” every unexpected outcome, the Company maintains liquidity via its “cash balance, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection” to “meet unforeseen claim demands,” supplementing cash flow through “repurchase agreements” and “notional cash pooling,” and preserving long-term flexibility by retaining the “ability to issue” debt or equity under an SEC shelf registration.  The firm’s product and geographic diversification “has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility,” and its profit-center structure grants management teams the autonomy “to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base,” thereby enabling the organization to “absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.”  To manage operational and cyber risks, Chubb “implements new security measures and systems,” continuously upgrades protections, and “endeavors to modify such procedures as circumstances warrant,” while establishing reserves based on “informed estimates and judgments” and adapting to evolving “legal, regulatory and/or social responses” to maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

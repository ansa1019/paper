Abbott’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through investments in its information systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of a cyber attack or other significant disruption, with ongoing monitoring for emerging threats, technological changes, and evolving regulatory requirements.  The company recognizes that business continuity and operational flexibility require significant expense and effort to ensure compliance with complex regulations, and accordingly enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate foreign-currency exposure, periodically utilizes factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, establishes allowances for doubtful trade receivables, and monitors economic conditions to preserve liquidity.  In response to internal and external disturbances—such as FDA observations following its acquisition of a manufacturing facility—Abbott has prepared comprehensive corrective-action plans and recorded restructuring charges to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs.  To support resilience strategies and resource reconfiguration after major acquisitions, Abbott maintains readily available financial resources, including $5 billion of unsecured credit lines and a commitment to redeem up to $5 billion of long-term notes, expects operating cash flows to exceed capital expenditures and dividends, and plans targeted debt repayments.  Quarterly impairment reviews of intangible assets, regular adjustments to rebate reserves based on historical trends, and substantial, ongoing research and development investments further illustrate the company’s systemic perspective, dynamic capabilities, and orientation toward preserving or improving functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances.

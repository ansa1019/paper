Our risk factors disclosure highlights that our business continuity plans are intended to address potential IT system failures, network outages and service provider disruptions; failure of these plans could result in reputational, competitive and business harm and legal or regulatory action. We are implementing a new global ERP system to replace existing operating and financial platforms, a major undertaking that could disrupt order processing, product shipment, service delivery, invoicing and contractual obligations if not effectively managed. We operate and rely upon manufacturing sites worldwide and recognize that natural disasters, equipment breakdowns, compliance concerns and supplier issues may interrupt production, and our ability to move to alternate production means and obtain regulatory approvals is critical to mitigate delays, loss of market share and reputational harm. Our reliance on sole-source and specialty suppliers for raw materials and components exposes us to shortages and price increases, and FDA and other regulatory validations constrain our capacity to qualify additional sources. We maintain a proactive global cash management strategy, generating substantial operational cash flow and supplementing it as needed with debt and commercial paper, with significant cash held outside the United States to fund organic growth, acquisitions and strategic initiatives. We record reserves for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical experience and future trends, and establish liabilities for product liability, legal, tax and recall contingencies based on actuarial and legal assessments, acknowledging that actual outcomes may differ and materially affect financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We invest in monitoring, expert personnel, employee training and security policies to address evolving cybersecurity threats to our IT systems, networks and data. We initiated a voluntary recall of specific Sage oral care products in response to FDA concerns, discontinued external manufacturing and resumed in-house production under revised testing methods. We announced and closed significant acquisitions—Entellus Medical and NovaDAQ Technologies—to reconfigure our product portfolio and strengthen our capacity for innovation and market responsiveness.

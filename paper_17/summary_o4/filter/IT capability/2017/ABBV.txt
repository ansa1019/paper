AbbVie’s periodic 10-K disclosures identify internal and external pressures—including supply chain interruptions from single-source suppliers, manufacturing disruptions caused by equipment malfunctions, protocol deviations, environmental or geopolitical events, cybersecurity breaches and regulatory actions—that could materially impair its ability to preserve operational continuity and system integrity. The company maintains business interruption insurance, credit and foreign exchange monitoring, hedging strategies, and proactively records rebate, chargeback and allowance reserves, while regularly monitoring its information technology systems, compliance programs and customer creditworthiness to mitigate risk. In response to intellectual property and competitive threats, AbbVie vigorously defends its patents through litigation and administrative proceedings, and allocates significant financial and human resources to research, development, strategic alliances, acquisitions, product launches and productivity initiatives, thereby reconfiguring its resource base to sustain performance and adapt to evolving market conditions. Its governance measures, including a revolving credit facility, strategic planning processes, takeover defenses and share repurchase and dividend policies, are designed to enhance financial and organizational resilience by safeguarding stakeholder interests and facilitating strategic agility. AbbVie’s articulated strategic objectives—revenue diversification through core product growth, late-stage pipeline advancement, margin expansion and shareholder returns—demonstrate its ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, consistent with the concept of organizational resilience as the maintenance of performance despite adversity.

The company employs a multifaceted approach to maintain performance and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continually forecasting and managing cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, including access to commercial paper supported by revolving credit facilities and adherence to statutory capital requirements in regulated subsidiaries. It allocates resources to manage medical cost risks through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs, employing “completion factors” and per-member-per-month medical cost trend analyses informed by utilization data, benefit design and macroeconomic indicators to estimate reserves and adjust for adverse developments. To mitigate external pressures and ensure operational continuity, the company obtains and maintains regulatory approvals, adjusts provider networks, benefit designs and member premiums in response to funding shortfalls or regulatory changes, and implements programs to detect, contain and respond to cyber-attacks and data security incidents. It pursues strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, integration of information-technology platforms and alliances, to reconfigure resources, leverage core competencies and support future planning, and monitors risk adjustment models, quality star ratings, capitation arrangements and credit ratings to anticipate and adapt to environmental disruptions. Surplus cash flows are reinvested in business expansion, capital expenditures, technology enhancements, share repurchases and dividend increases to reinforce long-term organizational strength, flexibility and resilience.

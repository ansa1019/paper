Qualcomm discloses that key strategic initiatives and disruptive events—including its pending NXP acquisition—pose integration risks and uncertainties that could jeopardize expected benefits, require substantial management time and resource allocation, and impair its ability to retain, recruit or motivate key personnel, while regulatory conditions or delays may further jeopardize or delay completion of transactions. The company acknowledges that reliance on a limited number of third-party suppliers and manufacturing facilities—subject to environmental, health and safety regulations, natural disasters, supply interruptions, capacity constraints and high fixed costs—could reduce yields or interrupt production, delay shipments or require costly facility, process or sourcing adjustments to maintain operational continuity. It highlights debt financing undertaken to fund acquisitions and the related use of significant cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which may reduce liquidity, limit flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. Qualcomm also emphasizes its need to sustain research and development investments and cost-reduction initiatives, improve facilities and process technologies, qualify alternate suppliers and enforce intellectual property rights to preserve performance, product lead, competitive positioning and firm resilience in the face of market volatility, environmental perturbations and rapid technological change.

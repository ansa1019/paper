Accenture’s operations are subject to “volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions” and changing demand patterns that require the company to adapt its services and solutions, forecast client demand, build revenue and resource plans, and respond effectively to environmental disruptions by driving innovation in digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings and deploying skilled teams of professionals on a global basis. To preserve functioning under internal or external variations and constraints, it maintains “appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and our resource capacity,” rebalance resources “through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations,” re-alignment of workforce to lower-cost locations, redeployment of existing personnel and increased reliance on subcontractors, and implements cost-management strategies and currency hedging programs to offset the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. The company’s global delivery capability and business continuity and disaster recovery plans are designed to mitigate hazards, absorb strain and maintain operational continuity, while its pursuit of strategic and targeted acquisitions, investments and joint ventures seeks to enhance or add to its capabilities, expand its offerings and reconstitute trajectories toward future objectives—acknowledging the risks of integration and potential disruptions to organizational health. It also employs compliance and risk mitigation mechanisms—ranging from cybersecurity defenses to internal controls, legal and tax processes and contractual safeguards—to manage security breaches, regulatory changes, litigation and other internal or external disturbances. Finally, Accenture’s emphasis on talent acquisition, retention and leadership development, including equity-based incentive compensation plans and the global deployment of personnel, underpins its ability to sustain performance under pressure, reinforce its dynamic capabilities and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet, transportation or other services facilities used by us, our employees or third parties, and, if a disruption occurs in one location and our employees are unable to occupy our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.  We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress, and that plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation.  Our global core liquid assets (gcla) represent liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment, and our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress, by conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements and holding cash balances and securities in entities and jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.  In parallel, we conduct dynamic stress testing and scenario analyses to quantify potential losses across market, credit and operational dimensions under moderate to extreme moves, and these insights inform our capital planning, risk limits and resolution strategies, thereby reinforcing the firmâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning while under pressure.

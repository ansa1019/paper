Mastercard’s filings describe a multifaceted approach to preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions by maintaining robust business continuity and risk mitigation programs across its global payments network.  The company relies on secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential data in its computer systems and networks, underpinned by an information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage reviewed by its board and audit committee, and continuously tests its systems to discover and address vulnerabilities.  It likewise maintains a commercial paper program and a committed $3.75 billion revolving credit facility to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes and to address potential settlement failures, ensuring access to cash generated from operations, investment securities and borrowing capacity sufficient to fund capital expenditures, credit and settlement exposure and other obligations.  In the event of transactional settlement defaults by issuers or acquirers, Mastercard may bear losses if customers fail to fund obligations, and recognizes that concurrent settlement failures could exceed available resources and materially impact its liquidity.  The firm also highlights service disruption risks—from technology malfunctions, infrastructure failures and extended outages of its real-time account-based payments network acquired through Vocalink—to underline the critical need for operational flexibility, integrated technology platforms, tight working relationships and cultural alignment in order to embed new capabilities, reconfigure processes and minimize the impact of disruptions on its brand, reputation and financial performance.  Throughout, Mastercard emphasizes its ongoing enhancement of controls, processes and practices designed to protect system integrity, support rapid recovery, adapt to evolving cyber-threats and ensure the continuity and resilience of its global payments operations.

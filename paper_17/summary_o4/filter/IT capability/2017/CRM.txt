In its risk factors section, the company acknowledges that unanticipated events or those currently deemed immaterial may nonetheless disrupt operations, cash flows and financial condition; discloses that breaches of its security measures—whether by external attackers, employee error or compromised third-party systems—could compromise data integrity, interrupt authorized access and expose the firm to significant legal, financial and reputational harm, and emphasizes these risks are mitigated by ongoing maintenance and improvement of business and data governance policies, internal security controls and escalation processes. The company states that it uses a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, including near real-time replication of production environments and customer data in separate facilities and alternate sites for certain offerings, while acknowledging such facilities remain vulnerable to earthquakes, floods, fires, power or telecommunications failures, sabotage, legal or permitting changes and other unanticipated problems that could result in extended service interruptions. It further notes that inadequate planning for infrastructure capacity, strains on data center resources or unsuccessful data transfers during growth initiatives could lead to performance degradation or outages, harm customer retention and subject the company to liability. The risk factors also describe crisis management and disaster response plans to address natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events, and warn that the company's headquarters in a seismically active region lacks earthquake insurance and that recovery time could be significant. Additionally, the company recognizes that climate-related events—including water and energy supply disruptions at primary locations—may impose losses and recovery costs. Internally, the company anticipates that rapidly growing customer demand and ongoing acquisitions impose strains on personnel resources and infrastructure, requiring continued investments in internal systems, data center capacity, research and development, customer support and real estate to scale operations, increase productivity and maintain service continuity, and cautions that failures to scale effectively or execute necessary operational and organizational controls could impair its business plan and long-term performance.

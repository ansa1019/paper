The annual report repeatedly underscores the importance of business continuity and the capacity to adapt to “natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions,” economic, political and regulatory changes, and competitive pressures by diversifying operations and mitigating risks.  Management highlights its ability to “access the commercial paper and other capital markets,” manage interest rate and currency translation risks, and “limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country” through geographic and industry diversity.  The company pursues “continuing productivity improvement initiatives,” cost‐containment efforts, and investments in sales, marketing and new product development to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning, while reconfiguring its business through “acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or strategic relationships” to generate resources and sustain operational flexibility.  Extensive internal controls and compliance systems, supplier standards of conduct, quality systems and regulatory compliance serve as mechanisms to protect against failures, errors, hazards and disruptions, and the firm deploys working capital management, restructuring actions and debt management to maintain performance and facilitate recovery in turbulent markets.

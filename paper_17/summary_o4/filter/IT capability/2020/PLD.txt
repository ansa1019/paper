Our disclosures emphasize a range of strategies and operational capabilities that support our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. We note that our business continuity, communication plans and technology are allowing all functions of our business to work smoothly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with employees continuing to work remotely or in office locations under protocols designed to keep a safe working environment, while local property and leasing teams maintain facilities and collaborate with customers to help them navigate the new environment safely. We have implemented flexible resource allocation measures such as deferring rental payments—amounting to less than 1% of our annualized rental revenue in 2020—and providing rent concessions that defer cash flow without impairing revenue recognition, reflecting our ability to absorb strain and reconfigure trajectories in response to customer needs. Our risk mitigation actions include natural hedging of foreign exchange exposure by borrowing in local currencies, the use of derivative contracts to limit market risks, and diversification through co-investment ventures, all intended to maintain system integrity and operational flexibility under internal or external variations. We routinely assess and seek to manage a broad spectrum of risks—from disruptions in global capital and credit markets to political instability, regulatory changes and environmental hazards—through geographic diversification, development of contingency financing sources, stringent compliance programs and insurance coverage against perils such as fire, flood, earthquake and terrorism. Our governance and management oversight, including deep industry knowledge and structured equity-based compensation awards, support organizational health and systemic perspectives, while our proactive capital deployment decisions—ranging from speculative development suspensions and restarts to selective property acquisitions, dispositions and co-investment contributions—demonstrate adaptability and a future orientation designed to sustain performance, preserve liquidity and emerge stronger from extreme conditions.

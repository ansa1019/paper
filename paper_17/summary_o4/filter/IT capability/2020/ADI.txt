The company’s risk disclosures describe circumstances that may test its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including the proposed acquisition of Maxim, which is subject to governmental approvals and closing conditions that may be delayed or impose adverse restrictions, potentially diverting significant management resources, delaying realization of expected benefits, constraining operational flexibility, and requiring reconfiguration of trajectories to achieve future performance targets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has modified its business practices—restricting travel, shifting employees to remote work, canceling events, and adjusting manufacturing operations—yet still faces supply chain disruptions, transportation limitations, workforce constraints, and heightened economic and demand uncertainty that may impair its capacity to perform critical functions and meet customer needs. The report further highlights organizational initiatives to realign global workforce structures and consolidate manufacturing facilities, reflecting resource reallocation and cost management strategies intended to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. It outlines the firm’s reliance on third-party suppliers, internal manufacturing capacity in geologically unstable regions, and critical information technology systems, where prolonged disruptions could necessitate rapid recovery efforts, risk mitigation, and mechanisms to preserve system integrity. The maintenance of substantial cash and cash equivalents, a committed revolving credit facility, and contingency planning for capital expenditures, acquisitions, and liquidity needs reflect a systemic perspective on business continuity and resilience. Finally, the company’s discussion of exposure to geopolitical, regulatory, currency and market volatility, and the use of hedging strategies, covenants and insurance to manage such external disturbances, underscores its focus on sustaining performance and partial integrity under both nominal and extreme conditions.

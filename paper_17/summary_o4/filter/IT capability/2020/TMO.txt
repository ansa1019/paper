The company’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to sustaining its integrity and performance under adverse conditions, including mobilizing in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 response with diagnostic and therapeutic products, taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize employee safety, maintaining close communication with sites, employees, customers and suppliers to mitigate a dynamic and evolving situation, and acknowledging that continued travel restrictions, quarantines and border closures could significantly impede its ability to support customers and maintain manufacturing continuity. It details business continuity and risk mitigation strategies through diversified supply chain management—identifying sole or limited sources of supply, assessing potential capacity constraints, bankruptcy or natural disasters—and through productivity improvements via its Practical Process Improvement system, global sourcing initiatives and restructuring actions expected to yield annual cost savings. The company reinforces adaptability by combining organic growth with complementary acquisitions to reconfigure capabilities, allocating research and development funding to high-growth products, expanding geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, and developing cross-selling commercial tools and infrastructure. Financial resilience is underpinned by substantial cash and cash equivalents, a $3 billion revolving credit facility, disciplined working capital management and planned capital expenditures of $2.2–$2.4 billion in 2021, all intended to ensure sufficient liquidity for at least the next 24 months. Continuous investment in research and development to adapt to rapid technological change, combined with robust information technology controls, disaster recovery planning, compliance systems and intellectual property protection, further demonstrate the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning, and emerge stronger from internal and external variations, whether nominal, extreme or exceptional.

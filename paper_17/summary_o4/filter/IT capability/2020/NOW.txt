The report describes a range of operational and strategic measures intended to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity, including temporarily closing most offices worldwide, encouraging employees to work remotely, implementing travel restrictions and shifting customer, industry and employee events to virtual-only experiences to maintain business continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic; it notes that this approach may continue, with variations by geography based on health protocols, and acknowledges potential costs, liabilities and health risks in re-opening offices. It highlights the development and release of four emergency response applications and a safe-workplace dashboard to help customers manage pandemic response and safe return–to–work processes, illustrating an investment in crisis management tools and service innovation. The company affirms the existence of crisis management and disaster response plans to address natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, geopolitical instability and other catastrophic events, while recognizing that such disruptions could make it difficult or impossible to deliver services, impair data-center operations and supply chains, and require significant further investments to maintain system integrity and security. Across risk factors, it emphasizes ongoing efforts to assess and mitigate external pressures—from regulatory changes and foreign currency fluctuations to cybersecurity threats and supply-chain dependencies—as well as internal initiatives in digital transformation, infrastructure capacity, remote-working support and control over financial reporting, all reflecting a systemic perspective on resilience, adaptability and the long-term maintenance of organizational performance and continuity.

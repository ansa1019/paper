We maintain a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies whose principal objective is to ensure that we can fund ourselves and enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues even under adverse circumstances, and our contingency funding plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to liquidity crises or market‐wide stress by outlining potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed continuously, delineating pre‐funding of estimated cash and collateral needs and secondary liquidity sources, and defining detailed response options in the event that we determine we have entered a liquidity crisis.  We hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of global core liquid assets across our parent company, intermediate holding company and principal regulated subsidiaries to enable timely settlement in all major markets even when funding markets experience persistent stress, and we dynamically manage our asset and liability mix, tenor and diversity of funding to match the liquidity characteristics of our assets and to allow for longer tenors where market dislocations may impair secured financing.  We regularly perform firmwide stress tests and a 30-day modeled liquidity outflow (including a two-notch ratings downgrade scenario, constrained funding markets and no government backstop) as well as intraday liquidity modeling to quantify tail risks, identify potential loss concentrations and ensure sufficient resilience capital and funding buffers.  As part of our operational risk and resilience framework, the firmwide operational risk and resilience committee oversees business continuity planning through the lens of business and operational resilience, defining principles for crisis management and ensuring that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption.  Our business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent firmwide and up-to-date, incorporating new information, techniques and technologies as they become available, and our resilience recovery plans incorporate and test specific, measurable recovery time objectives under various scenarios aligned with local market best practices and regulatory requirements.  Since deploying our business continuity planning strategy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have safeguarded our employees and maintained continuity of operations through disciplined work-from-home arrangements, staged reoccupancy protocols that account for the readiness of people, communities and facilities, robust safety measures such as building access controls, physical distancing, enhanced cleaning and on-site testing, and ongoing dialogue with key stakeholders to assess health and safety conditions, while our systems and infrastructure have proven robust and our decision-making processes disciplined and rigorous, enabling us to continue serving clients worldwide without disruption.  We also maintain an information and cyber security program that continuously monitors and adapts our technology infrastructure, systems and controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data in the face of evolving threats.  In addition, as part of our resolution planning we have developed a triggers and alerts framework and resolution liquidity adequacy models to estimate the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries and to support wind-down and stabilization in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy, ensuring we maintain sufficient excess loss-absorbing capacity and liquidity to absorb shocks under a broad range of severe stress scenarios.  Our model risk management function ensures that the quantitative models used to measure and manage our market, credit, liquidity and capital risks are subject to independent review, validation and governance, and our firmwide conduct and reputational risk committees oversee conduct standards and reputational considerations as integral components of our resilience strategies.  Through these integrated risk and resilience frameworks, we seek to maintain our integrity and performance, at least partially, when faced with internal or external variations, disturbances or unexpected conditions in the markets and the broader environment.

Starbucks discloses that the COVID-19 pandemic represented an external disturbance that “has been and will continue to be disrupted to varying degrees,” triggering mitigation measures such as drive-thru and delivery operations, temporary store closures and modified hours, and the qualification for CARES Act and other government payroll tax credits, which are treated “as offsets to the related operating expenses.” Management emphasizes active liquidity management, stating it “actively manage[s] [its] cash and investments to internally fund operating needs” and may leverage its balance sheet through debt issuance and suspended share repurchases to reinforce near-term liquidity. The gradual reopening of stores under enhanced health protocols and evolving customer behaviors has led to “sequential improvements in comparable store sales … reflecting the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand.” Protecting human capital has involved incremental labor costs, including “catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs” and support for furloughed partners, while substantial investments in information technology, disaster recovery and business continuity plans are designed “to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches.” In its supply chain Starbucks uses fixed-price commodity contracts and derivatives to manage price volatility, monitors key suppliers despite concentration risks, and supports licensees through fee waivers and flexible financial terms. Strategic initiatives to enhance adaptability include optimizing the North America store portfolio by “blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences,” accelerating alternative formats such as curbside pickup, and conducting impairment testing of store and intangible assets using discounted cash flow models, which in fiscal 2020 resulted in restructuring charges and projected exit costs for planned closures. Governance mechanisms cover market risks—commodity, currency, interest rate and cybersecurity—while deferred tax asset valuations and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assessments are maintained under scenarios that assume recovery to pre-pandemic cash flow levels, affirming that the carrying values of long-lived assets and deferred tax assets remain supportable absent a sustained multi-year global decline.

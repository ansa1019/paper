The filing describes the company’s efforts to build, maintain, and scale its technical infrastructure to support increased demands—particularly those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic—and acknowledges risks associated with service disruptions, interruptions, natural disasters, capacity constraints, and the potential inability to recover infrastructure and user data in a timely manner. It details dependencies on third-party mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, and browser providers, noting that changes, bugs, or policy actions outside the company’s control could degrade product functionality, reduce advertising targeting and measurement capabilities, and impair monetization. The report highlights extensive privacy, safety, security, and content review programs—such as investigations and audits of platform applications—and compliance with evolving legal and regulatory requirements (including the FTC consent order, GDPR, CCPA, and ePrivacy Directive), which demand significant operational resources, process modifications, and ongoing investments. The company explains its capital spending on data centers, servers, network capacity, and office facilities and its strategic decision-making approach that may prioritize long-term user experience, security, and resilience over short-term financial results. Supply chain and logistics risks for consumer hardware products—quality issues, component shortages, and reliance on third-party manufacturers—are also discussed, underscoring efforts to manage resource constraints and maintain operational continuity. These descriptions collectively illustrate resilience strategies aimed at absorbing strain, mitigating hazards, reconfiguring resource deployment, and preserving system integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

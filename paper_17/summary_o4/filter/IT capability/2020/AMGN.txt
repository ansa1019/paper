Throughout the report the company underscores its resilience capabilities by activating comprehensive business continuity plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including suspending U.S. in-person meetings, transitioning the majority of its workforce to remote work, implementing supplier and patient support programs, and increasing investments to ensure uninterrupted critical functions and operations despite workforce restrictions and transportation disruptions. It details a structured risk management framework that identifies and quantifies forward-looking risks and uncertainties, continually adjusts accruals for rebates, chargebacks and returns based on evolving market conditions, and monitors distributor and payer financial health to anticipate liquidity constraints. The company emphasizes the resilience of its information technology by describing sophisticated, integrated systems and network-connected control infrastructures, acknowledging their vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and breakdowns, and committing to ongoing monitoring, protection and recovery measures to preserve confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. Supply-chain resilience is addressed through diversification of third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers, hedging strategies to mitigate foreign-exchange exposures, and contingency plans such as operating Puerto Rico manufacturing facilities on backup diesel generators following natural disasters, thereby safeguarding product supply and production continuity. Further, adaptive capital-allocation decisions—including debt refinancing, cross-currency and interest-rate hedges, and flexible stock repurchase and dividend programs—alongside collaboration with external partners and regulatory agencies, support the company’s ability to maintain performance and system integrity under challenging and unpredictable conditions.

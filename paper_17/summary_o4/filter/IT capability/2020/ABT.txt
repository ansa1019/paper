Abbott invests in systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of cyber attacks or other significant disruptions, monitoring its infrastructure on an ongoing basis for potential threats and regulatory changes. The company continually implements business continuity plans; during the COVID-19 pandemic Abbott was generally exempt from shutdown orders, shifted the majority of its office-based functions to remote work, imposed strict travel restrictions, and later organized a rotational return to offices, while taking aggressive measures to limit exposure and enhance facility safety. Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to accelerate the development, regulatory authorization, and manufacturing scale-up of numerous diagnostic tests for COVID-19 and continues to invest in product development areas that provide opportunities for strong sustainable growth. Abbott’s diversified portfolio, spanning medical devices, diagnostics, nutritionals, and pharmaceuticals, supports adaptability to changing demand, as evidenced by rapid growth in COVID-19 related testing alongside mitigation of routine procedure declines. The company’s financial resilience is underpinned by robust cash flows from operating activities that exceed capital expenditures and dividends, substantial liquidity including unused credit facilities supporting up to $5 billion of unsecured borrowing, commitment to maintain investment grade ratings, active debt management through timely redemptions of long-term notes and disciplined share repurchase programs, and hedging strategies to mitigate foreign currency and other market risks. Abbott monitors customer credit risk, maintains allowances reflecting expected credit losses, and applies agile resource allocation to fund pension obligations, research and development portfolios targeting key therapeutic and platform opportunities, and strategic initiatives to streamline operations, leverage economies of scale, and manage uncertainties. Regular reviews of goodwill and intangible assets and impairment assessments further ensure the preservation of performance and integrity under varying internal or external pressures. Such measures illustrate Abbott’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning under adversity, and emerge with strengthened operational flexibility and competitive positioning.

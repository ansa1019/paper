In response to unprecedented travel restrictions, demand shocks and partner closures triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company undertook a series of actions to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions: it raised $4.1 billion in debt and amended its $2 billion revolving credit facility—suspending leverage covenants and imposing minimum liquidity requirements—to preserve operational flexibility and access to capital; it reduced recurrent operating costs by eliminating non-essential travel, canceling company events, imposing a temporary global hiring freeze, cutting marketing spend worldwide and restructuring its workforce (with related charges of $149 million) to optimize efficiency and safeguard organizational health; it participated in wage-subsidy and stimulus programs in multiple jurisdictions while raising provisions for expected credit losses on receivables to mitigate credit risk and preserve cash flow; it accelerated its transition to a merchant payment model to enhance payment options and bear direct transaction and fraud risk on behalf of customers and partners; it tightened cybersecurity, data-privacy and system-redundancy measures to uphold system integrity and business continuity; it developed “connected trip” digital and mobile platforms and shared technological and personnel resources across its brands to enhance adaptability, service innovation and competitive advantage; it employed derivative hedges and scenario-based forecasting to manage foreign-currency and liquidity risks and recalibrate cash and capital allocation under prolonged uncertainty; and it reinforced tax, legal and regulatory contingency planning—including managing price-parity and data-protection investigations—to sustain compliance, preserve stakeholder trust and support the firm’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure trajectories of response and preserve functioning despite adversity.

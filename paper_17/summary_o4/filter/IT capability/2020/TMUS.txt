The report discloses that the pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our business, liquidity, financial condition and operating results, impacting the demand for our products and services, the ways in which our customers use them, where and how we work, and our suppliers’ ability to provide products to us. To ensure the safety of both customers and employees, we continue to open, close, and limit capacity of our retail stores in compliance with local and state mandates and orders, noting that even when stores are open, decreased traffic and lower switching activity persist. We expect to continue to work with customers to help them maintain service and become current on their accounts, efforts which may divert resources from our network build-out and put additional strain on our network, potentially affecting customer experience. We have implemented remote working arrangements for many employees, increased cleaning and sanitation in our facilities, supplemented pay and leave benefits, and have offered creative, COVID-safe solutions such as virtual selling and curbside pickup to protect the well-being of our workforce and sustain operations. During the pandemic, we committed to the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected pledge, including pledges not to terminate service for customers who are unable to pay due to the pandemic and to waive late fees, and provided unlimited high-speed smartphone data and additional hotspot allowances to enable remote learning and working. We partnered with spectrum holders and the FCC to deploy additional 600 MHz spectrum on a temporary basis, effectively doubling LTE capacity to help ensure connectivity for first responders and communities, and continue to expand our 5G network while adhering to evolving guidelines. Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and defend against attacks must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever-evolving threat landscape, as system failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use or interference with our network, compromise customer information, and result in significant remediation costs, liability, reputational damage, and regulatory actions. We rely on third parties for network components, software and customer support, and the failure of these suppliers could severely disrupt our operations if they fail to comply with contractual standards or experience natural catastrophic events, highlighting the need for resilient supply-chain practices and risk mitigation. In connection with obtaining regulatory approvals for the Sprint merger, we agreed to numerous government commitments, specifying timeframes for 5G network build-out, delivery of high-speed wireless services, and other obligations, failure of which could result in fines or administrative actions, divert management time and energy from business operations and potentially force business decisions that may not otherwise be made. We are implementing restructuring initiatives to realize cost efficiencies from the merger by eliminating redundancies in network operations, retail, information technology and back-office processes, instituting contract terminations, store rationalization, severance programs and network site decommissioning, and have incurred substantial transaction and integration costs which we expect will be recouped through synergies over the next three years. As a combined company, we expect to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, increase competition and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network and other business processes and operations. We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, which involve risks including diversion of management attention, integration challenges, potential exposure to liabilities, and the possibility that expected benefits or synergies will not be achieved, requiring adaptive strategies and operational flexibility. Moreover, we face industry consolidation, intense competition for customers, evolving consumer demands and macroeconomic pressures that could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, underscoring the importance of business continuity planning, strategic response capabilities and maintenance of positive performance under pressure.

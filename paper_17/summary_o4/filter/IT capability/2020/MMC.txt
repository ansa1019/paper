The Company describes a comprehensive framework of business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession to preserve its integrity and performance under internal or external disturbances, noting that its ability to operate through earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, pandemics, cyberattacks, power or telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks or other continuity events depends on the uninterrupted availability of personnel, office facilities, technology infrastructure and third-party service providers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has modified its operating model by transitioning substantially all colleagues to a remote work environment, restricting travel, implementing social distancing plans and cancelling physical events, while acknowledging that extended remote work arrangements may affect its business continuity plans and its ability to continue providing services to clients. To enhance resilience against evolving cyber threats, the Company has invested in technology and infrastructure, instituted employee training (including phishing prevention), multi-factor authentication, data encryption and heightened monitoring, yet recognizes that its complex information systems and those of its vendors remain vulnerable to unauthorized access, malware, ransomware and advanced persistent threats, any of which could disrupt system integrity, impede recovery efforts or compromise sensitive client or company data. The Company also emphasizes its ongoing assessment and improvement of contingency arrangements—including reliance on diversified vendors, insurance programs, regulatory compliance processes, strategic response capabilities and contingency funding—to mitigate risks of legal liability, reputational harm or material financial loss should it experience a failure in its disaster or data recovery mechanisms or be unable to deploy timely security patches and safeguards under challenging conditions.

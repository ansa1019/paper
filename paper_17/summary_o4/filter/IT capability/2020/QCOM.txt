The company has modified workforce practices—shifting the vast majority of employees to remote work—to preserve operational continuity in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and has so far maintained manufacturing and supply chain operations, while acknowledging that future quarantines or travel restrictions could impair critical functions and performance under adverse conditions. It employs both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models and has established alternate foundry and assembly suppliers, balancing firm and nonbinding purchase commitments to manage raw material procurement, capacity planning and demand shifts, thereby seeking to absorb internal and external variations such as health crises, trade policies, natural disasters and geopolitical events while preventing excess or obsolete inventory. The Company continually monitors and adjusts its supplier network to mitigate risks to product supply and delivery, including interruptions, delays or quality issues, to sustain service levels. In licensing, it negotiates and enters multi-year patent license and settlement agreements with significant customers, estimating and recognizing royalties based on actual quarterly sales to support revenue continuity and financial stability. Research and development investments are focused on 5G and adjacent technologies to adapt to evolving industry standards, secure competitive advantage and maintain technological leadership, while legal and regulatory proceedings are managed proactively to protect contractual and intellectual property positions. Through strategic sourcing, capacity assurance, legal risk mitigation, financial forecasting and ongoing supplier diversification, the Company aims to maintain integrity and performance, reconfigure resources under stress and achieve positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

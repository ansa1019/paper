The risk factors section describes actions taken to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including “temporary closure of Adobe offices globally,” “travel restrictions,” the establishment of a “global work-from-home operating environment” and the shift of all in-person customer, employee and industry events to virtual-only experiences, while cautioning that these “conditions may persist and harm our business”; it acknowledges ongoing business continuity and resilience planning through “disaster recovery planning” for data centers, redundancy in hosted services and disaster recovery plans that “may not account for all eventualities,” and it recognizes that a “disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems … in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other … catastrophic event” could cause severe system interruptions and reputational harm; the filing further details resource-allocation and risk-mitigation measures such as the use of a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, foreign currency hedges, structured stock repurchase agreements and substantial cash and short-term investments to absorb strain, preserve functioning and ensure operational continuity, while also highlighting dependencies on third-party hosting, supply chain resiliency amid climate-related hazards like wildfires and drought, and the need for adaptability in infrastructure capacity planning to meet rapid spikes in customer demand and avoid service outages.

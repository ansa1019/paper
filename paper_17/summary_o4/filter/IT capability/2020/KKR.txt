KKR’s risk disclosures emphasize the firm’s focus on preserving operational integrity under stress through a business continuity plan that includes initiatives such as remote working arrangements, contingency procedures for key employees, and efforts to maintain business continuity where traditional office operations are disrupted, while acknowledging that such plans “cannot anticipate all scenarios.” The firm underscores that difficult market and economic conditions—ranging from reduced credit availability and equity market volatility to widespread disruptions such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic—are beyond its control and may impair its ability to write down investments, raise or deploy capital and scale costs to match decreased net income, despite its mitigation efforts. KKR also highlights its reliance on complex information systems, third-party service providers and distributed global offices—particularly its New York headquarters—each of which may be disrupted by disasters, cyber-security failures or pandemic-related restrictions, and notes that remote working environments in response to COVID-19 have strained technology resources, increased cybersecurity risk, and challenged employee well-being, morale and productivity. These disclosures reflect an implicit resilience strategy that combines preventive measures, such as risk-mitigating controls, disaster recovery programs and enhanced cybersecurity safeguards, with reactive measures, including contingency plans, dynamic reconfiguration of work processes, and ongoing assessment of external pressures to preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

PepsiCo describes a comprehensive approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by deploying health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management measures—such as temporary facility closures, workforce protection (expanded benefits, frontline incentives, personal protective equipment and remote-work support) and contingency funding for its bottling partners—to preserve its supply chain, distribution network and manufacturing operations during the COVID-19 pandemic and other natural or political disruptions. The company has further enhanced operational flexibility by accelerating digital and e-commerce capabilities, reconfiguring its end-to-end value chain through productivity initiatives, shared services, manufacturing automation and simplified organizational structures, and by making targeted capital investments to expand capacity and improve resilience engineering. PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework—overseen by its board and supported by a cross-functional risk committee and division-level risk teams—employs systematic risk assessment, scenario planning, risk‐mitigation tools (including commodity, foreign currency and interest rate derivatives), crisis simulations and stakeholder engagement to monitor and respond to internal or external variations, extreme weather events, political unrest, cyber incidents and other hazards. To ensure system integrity and performance under pressure, the company maintains contingency plans for raw‐material shortages, rigorous quality and traceability controls, information systems redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities, and pursues strategic agility through continuous product innovation, resource reconfiguration and diversification of channels and geographies.

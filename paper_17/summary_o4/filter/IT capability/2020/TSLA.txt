Since the first quarter of 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to government regulations and shifting social behaviors that limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions, and we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of 2020. Some of our suppliers and partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming, including Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada, and we instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations were scaled back. To mitigate these challenges, we suspended non-critical operating spend, opportunistically renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangements, received payroll-related benefits that were netted against our disclosed idle capacity charges, and continued to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate. We emphasize that sustaining our production trajectory will require the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and ongoing government cooperation, including for travel and visa allowances, and that we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. We further acknowledge that global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact us, as pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, and increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall in microchip supply. We note that the contingencies inherent in the construction of and ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges, and if current global market conditions continue or worsen, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with such conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.

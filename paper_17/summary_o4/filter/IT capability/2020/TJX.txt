Following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and facility closures, the temporary closure of all stores, online businesses and distribution centers adversely impacted our operations, financial position and liquidity, yet as stores and facilities reopened we implemented enhanced cleaning protocols, occupancy limitations and health and safety measures, provided discretionary appreciation bonuses and incurred costs for personal protective equipment, and established global task force teams to navigate these challenges. We negotiated rent deferrals for significant lease payments, temporarily extended payment terms on merchandise orders and remeasured lease liabilities to preserve liquidity, while evaluating and adjusting inventory values through permanent markdowns and write-offs to reflect transitional and out-of-season merchandise and recognizing triggering events for asset impairments. We managed our supply chain by monitoring potential disruptions to suppliers and logistics providers, maintaining lean inventory levels, frequent inventory turns and opportunistic buying, and ensuring merchants react effectively to rapidly changing market trends in order to source the right merchandise at the right times, quantities and prices. To support operational flexibility and performance maintenance, we allocated and delivered merchandise with appropriate mix and inventory levels, adjusted store floor space among product categories, refined sales forecasting to align inventory purchases with customer demand and temporarily suspended share repurchases to conserve cash, while qualifying for government programs that reduced related expenses by approximately $0.5 billion. Our reliance on robust IT systems required accurate anticipation of technology needs, implementation of disaster recovery plans, ongoing investments in IT security workforce, technologies and processes, and maintenance of policies and controls to reduce the risk of data security compromises, system damage or business disruptions. We generated $4.6 billion of operating cash flows, increased cash and equivalents to $10.5 billion, expanded revolving credit facilities to $1.5 billion and issued new notes while managing early extinguishments to maintain financial flexibility, and we expect to allocate $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022 for capital expenditures across infrastructure, distribution centers and store expansions. We continue to monitor regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, macroeconomic volatility—including foreign exchange rate fluctuations and credit market conditions—and evolving legal, tax and environmental requirements, in order to bolster our resilience, ensure business continuity and preserve organizational flexibility in the face of unprecedented challenges.

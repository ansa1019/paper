In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has focused on maintaining a reliable supply of its medicines, reducing the strain on the medical system, developing treatments for COVID-19, protecting the health, safety, and well-being of employees, supporting communities, and ensuring affordability of and access to its medicines, particularly insulin.  In certain locations it temporarily halted in-person interactions with healthcare providers and increased virtual interactions, resuming on a safe, compliant basis, and paused new clinical trial starts and enrollment to reduce medical system strain before resuming activity as conditions allowed.  The company acknowledges that the pandemic intensifies risks inherent in drug pricing, clinical trials, workplace safety, supply chain disruptions, manufacturing operations, global distribution systems, third-party dependencies, and adverse economic conditions, and that future impacts depend on highly uncertain developments beyond its control, including virus duration, severity, and vaccine availability.  It continues to implement measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent cybersecurity and other operational risks and to enhance the resiliency of its IT systems, maintains cyber liability insurance, and manages foreign exchange and interest rate exposures through hedging.  The company continuously evaluates its liquidity and capital resources—comprising cash, cash equivalents, operating cash flow, short- and long-term borrowings, committed credit facilities, and commercial paper—and manages research and development spending across a diversified pipeline so that delays or terminations of individual projects do not materially affect total investment.  It relies on third-party relationships and outsourcing for clinical trials, manufacturing, distribution, and IT support, monitors performance and compliance against potential disruptions or failures, and holds itself self-insured for product liability.  Strategic business development, including acquisitions of Loxo, Dermira, and Prevail and collaborations with numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners, exemplifies resource reconfiguration, diversification, and future orientation to bolster the pipeline.  The company also anticipates and plans for patent expiries, generic and biosimilar competition, downward pricing pressures from payers, and trade or regulatory changes, and invests in patient affordability solutions, thereby seeking to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance under challenging and evolving conditions.

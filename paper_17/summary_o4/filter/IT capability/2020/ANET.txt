The Company’s disclosures reflect a multifaceted approach to maintaining operational integrity and performance under adverse conditions, including health epidemics, natural disasters, terrorism and other catastrophic events that may disrupt critical functions such as manufacturing, supply chain, order processing, inventory and quality control, shipping and trade compliance. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic and related shelter-in-place orders, the Company closed offices and shifted the vast majority of its workforce to remote operations, worked closely with contract manufacturers and fulfillment centers experiencing workforce restrictions and government access limitations, and addressed resulting lead-time increases and logistic challenges by purchasing buffer inventories of long-lead-time components, establishing non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with suppliers and recording corresponding excess and obsolete inventory liabilities to ensure adequate supply for long-term customer demand. The Company further manages resilience through multiple sourcing strategies—monitoring sole or limited-source merchant silicon providers, undertaking product redesigns when component shortages occur, enforcing rigorous quality assurance testing and maintaining spare parts inventories—and by closely evaluating its contingency for non-cancelable purchase commitments and freight exposures. Liquidity management is underscored by a substantial portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to meet working capital needs, while regulatory and compliance resilience is supported by regular reviews of export control, data privacy, environmental and tax positions (including allowances for uncertain tax matters) and the agility to adapt internal policies as laws evolve. These measures collectively serve as strategic mechanisms by which the Company absorbs strain, mitigates disruptions and preserves or improves its functioning and financial condition under challenging and unpredictable conditions.

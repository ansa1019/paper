In April 2020 we announced a customer relief program to provide credits against service fees, defer lease payments and extend payment terms, reflecting our commitment to preserve functioning under challenging conditions. We have diversified our acquisition and financing models—through sales-type and operating leases, usage-based arrangements and alternative capital approaches—to enhance operational flexibility and resource allocation in response to shifting customer needs and economic pressures. We support business continuity by maintaining contingency inventory, implementing a foreign currency hedging program, collaborating closely with suppliers and distributors to ensure continuity of supply, and deploying multiple manufacturing sites and automation investments to mitigate production risks. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we prioritized health and safety with continuous policy updates, secured our workforce economically by managing hiring and constraining avoidable spend, and continued investing in our priority development programs while adapting our manufacturing and supply chain processes. Our holistic ecosystem strategy integrates intelligent technology with remote simulation, telepresence, and joint ventures to sustain performance under regulatory delays, facility disruptions and market volatility. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents, and we have optimized our instrument durability through an extended use program to reduce costs for customers. The establishment of an Intuitive Ventures fund and ongoing research and development investments further demonstrate our strategic agility, risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration measures designed to maintain continuity, adapt to disruptions and strengthen our capacity to emerge stronger from adversity.

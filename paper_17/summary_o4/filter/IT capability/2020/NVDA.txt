Our business continuity planning addresses internal and external adversities and ensures the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through risk mitigation, resource allocation, and operational flexibility. We structure our supply chain to scale and adapt as our business grows, recognizing dependence on third-party foundries and subcontractors and cooperating with them to resolve yield and capacity issues. We continuously engineer more secure products, enhance security and reliability features, develop internal and supplier security measures, and invest in recovery mechanisms to defend against evolving cyber threats and data protection breaches that could disrupt critical functions, interrupt order fulfillment, or result in substantial recovery time and expenditures. To mitigate the impact of natural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events, we have implemented work-from-home policies, modified business practices, and adjusted our operational resources, while acknowledging that restrictions on travel, transportation, and supplier operations could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and adversely affect our financial condition. We maintain significant cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, alongside commercial paper and credit facilities, to ensure liquidity for working capital, capital expenditures, and emergency management, and regularly review our liquidity and capital resources to satisfy obligations. During periods of constrained supply, we make advance inventory commitments and forecast demand, but recognize that shortfalls in supply or excess inventory due to demand volatility may damage customer relationships, impair financial results, and require additional resource reconfiguration. Our resilience strategy includes continuous evaluation of emerging risks, strategic foresight in resource deployment, and cross-functional collaboration to preserve our organizational integrity, adapt operating parameters under pressure, and sustain performance under a range of internal variations and external disturbances.

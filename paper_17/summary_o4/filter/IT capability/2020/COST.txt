The risk factors discussion highlights the company’s efforts to manage business continuity and operational flexibility by acknowledging its dependency on regional operations and the potential for external pressures—such as slow growth in comparable sales, regulatory constraints on site development, and competition for suitable locations—to materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations; the company has made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of its supply chains and supply chain resiliency, and to enhance operational flexibility in response to disruptions.  Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities—from fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions and catastrophic events, to labor issues or shipping problems—are identified as hazards that may result in delays in production and delivery of merchandise, underscoring the need for robust risk mitigation, emergency management and reconfiguring of logistics to preserve sales and member satisfaction.  The information technology section describes the critical role of IT systems in processing high volumes of transactions, tracking inventory and supporting e-commerce, and emphasizes initiatives to build strong digital resiliency for business-critical systems—to prevent disruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, viruses, security breaches, employee errors and catastrophic events—and significant investments to enhance digital resiliency, which are essential for maintaining functionality under disruptive conditions.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company implemented precautionary measures—including remote work arrangements, temporary compensation increases and sanitation protocols—to protect employees and members, and adapted its supply chain by finding alternate product sources, adjusting inventory levels and managing higher transportation costs, demonstrating adaptability, resource reconfiguration and continuity of operations under extreme and unpredictable conditions.  Financial and capital resource disclosures describe actions to strengthen liquidity through the issuance and repayment of senior notes, maintenance of bank credit facilities and letter of credit capacity, and self-insurance and reinsurance programs, reflecting the organization’s ability to absorb financial strain, allocate resources for recovery and preserve system integrity and performance despite market volatility and unforeseen contingencies.  The natural disasters and public health emergencies section identifies potential impacts—physical damage to properties, limitations on operations, workforce shortages, IT disruptions and supply chain interruptions—from events such as hurricanes, floods, acts of terrorism, pandemics and quarantines, emphasizing the importance of risk assessment, crisis response strategies and emergency preparedness to sustain organizational health and performance under pressure.  The management’s discussion and analysis further illustrates how the company adapts to economic fluctuations and competitive pressures through adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix, expansion of e-commerce and omnichannel experiences, leveraging comparable sales growth to enhance profitability, and strategic investments in infrastructure and technology, all of which contribute to the maintenance of performance, recovery from disruptive events and the preservation of competitive advantage.

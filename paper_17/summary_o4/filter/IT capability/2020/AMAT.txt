Applied Materials has implemented a series of organizational resilience measures to maintain continuity and positive adjustment during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. The ongoing pandemic and global measures—quarantines, facility closures, travel and logistics restrictions, border controls, shelter-in-place and social distancing orders—have adversely impacted and continue to impact Applied’s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as those of its customers, suppliers and partners. In response, Applied has seen recovery within its supply chain, but continues to face transportation disruptions, production delays and capacity limitations, reduced workforce availability and productivity, and increased data, information and cyber-security risks associated with a remote workforce. To mitigate these pressures, Applied responded quickly to institute precautionary measures to keep workplaces healthy and safe—working remotely where possible, minimizing onsite personnel, enforcing screenings, social distancing and personal protective equipment, and following enhanced safety and health protocols. Applied maintains business continuity by keeping critical labs and operations active, supporting customers with multi-phase return-to-site plans that align business needs, local regulations, community case trends and public health guidance, and by adjusting global operations in collaboration with employees, customers and suppliers to manage fluid and uncertain conditions. The company remains committed to investing in research, development and engineering, maintaining a global business infrastructure, sustaining innovation and competitive advantage, deploying resources to meet rapidly changing demand, effectively managing its diverse, geographically distributed workforce, supply chain and production capacity, and aligning cost structures with prevailing market conditions during periods of decreasing demand. Financially, Applied strengthened its liquidity and flexibility by borrowing $1.5 billion under its revolving credit facility to safeguard its cash position amid market uncertainty, executing accounts receivable financing arrangements, actively monitoring credit risk in its investment portfolio, and balancing capital expenditures on demonstration and testing equipment, property improvement and technology investments with share repurchases, dividends and debt management. These strategies reflect Applied’s systemic perspective on resilience—preserving integrity and performance under internal and external variations and disturbances, adapting processes and resource allocation to evolving challenges, and striving for operational flexibility, risk mitigation, and the capacity to anticipate, confront and benefit from disruptive change.

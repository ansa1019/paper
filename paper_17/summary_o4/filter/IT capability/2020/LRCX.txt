In response to the COVID-19 outbreak and resulting quarantines, travel bans, shutdowns, social distancing measures, facility closures, production delays and capacity limitations, the company has implemented business continuity plans, required modifications to business processes, the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply, changes to existing manufacturing processes, and the implementation of social distancing measures that affect facility staffing and necessitated teleworking by a large proportion of the workforce. The company continuously reassesses its strategic resource allocation choices and, where appropriate, employs cost management programs aimed at aligning expenditures with anticipated revenue streams during periods of variability and periods of rapid growth or decline. Even during periods of reduced revenues, it continues to invest in research and development and maintain extensive worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive. To mitigate risks to critical information systems, the company has implemented ISO 27001-compliant security procedures, virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access control, and emergency recovery processes. While the company’s primary manufacturing facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations subject to natural or man-made disruptions, business continuity plans are maintained to address potential delays in shipping and preserve operations under internal or external variations. The company maintains significant liquidity reserves—drawing on cash, cash equivalents, investments, a commercial paper program, and an unsecured revolving credit facility with backstop provisions—and employs foreign currency hedging strategies to support sustaining levels of investment in capital infrastructure, research and development, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, and operational continuity through at least the next twelve months under current business outlook assumptions.

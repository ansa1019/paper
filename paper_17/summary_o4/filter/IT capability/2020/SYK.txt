The report discloses that the global COVID-19 pandemic has “materially adversely affected” operations, supply chains, manufacturing, product distribution and service networks through travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns, necessitating a “significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations” as market demand shifts, including reallocation of workforce, suspension or delay of manufacturing, research and development, regulatory and clinical programs, and reprioritization of critical personnel functions to preserve continuity. It describes the implementation of operating expense savings actions and workforce measures, the reconfiguration of manufacturing capacity under government directives (such as the U.S. Defense Production Act), and resource deployment to maintain operational flexibility and business continuity. The company highlights adaptations to evolving external pressures—ranging from stringent medical device and healthcare regulations, pricing and reimbursement changes, tax reforms, data protection requirements (HIPAA, GDPR) and anti-corruption statutes—to mitigate risk, avoid operational disruption and preserve organizational health. Reliance on indirect distribution channels and sole-source suppliers has prompted alternative sourcing and emergency management plans to ensure timely product availability, while investments in IT resilience, cybersecurity defenses, remote-work protocols and the rollout of a new global ERP system aim to safeguard order processing, service delivery, information integrity and financial controls. Liquidity and financial resilience are maintained through robust cash-flow generation, debt financing and credit facilities, suspension of share repurchases and disciplined capital allocation, even as the company pursues strategic acquisitions and integration initiatives to bolster competitive advantage, reconstitute capabilities and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

The company’s disclosures describe a comprehensive approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including a long-standing business continuity plan for unforeseeable events and the modification of business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related third-party and governmental actions; investments in building inventory and expanding its global internally-owned manufacturing footprint—enabling the flexibility to build products across multiple sites and thus absorb supply-chain strain; strategic, business and organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring to support objectives and reconfigure resources under pressure; disciplined capital allocation across R&D, new manufacturing capacity and sustaining competitive advantages in analog and embedded processing; ongoing risk assessment and mitigation of geopolitical, macroeconomic, cybersecurity and supplier-related disruptions; and the use of financial resources—free cash flow, cash, short-term investments and revolving credit facilities—to preserve system integrity, reconstitute operations during constraints, and adapt processes so that the organization can continue functioning and emerge stronger from extreme or exceptional conditions.

We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments presenting numerous risks, many of which we cannot control or predict, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its disparate impacts on customer demand, supply chains and employee work practices; in response we have modified employee travel, work locations and marketing events, will continue to actively monitor evolving conditions, and may undertake further actions to alter our operations to protect employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders. We recognize that our ability to maintain business continuity and “positive adjustment under challenging conditions” hinges on our capacity to develop new products and services, to integrate acquired products and services and to enhance existing offerings in a timely manner, to anticipate and address evolving IT trends, disruptive technologies and delivery models, and to position and price our products competitively. We continuously refresh and release new cloud products and services, invest in infrastructure and early adoption of new technologies, and support multiple on-premise, cloud and hybrid deployment models in order to preserve or improve our functioning under internal or external disturbances. We have invested extensively in securing the integrity of our IT systems and data, in risk assessment and mitigation measures, and in monitoring for and responding to cyber-attacks and other security vulnerabilities that may be exacerbated by public health crises or geopolitical instability. We rely on diversified partner and supplier ecosystems but acknowledge that single-source components, third-party manufacturing partners and global logistical networks may be disrupted by natural disasters, regulatory actions, pandemic-related shutdowns or other exceptional conditions, and we maintain contract commitments, hedging strategies and compliance programs to manage these vulnerabilities. We also undertake restructuring and workforce redeployment initiatives to realign resources, streamline operations and enhance operational flexibility, recognizing that fluctuations in customer purchasing behavior, currency exchange rates, and economic or political conditions can affect contract renewals, conversion rates and overall firm performance.

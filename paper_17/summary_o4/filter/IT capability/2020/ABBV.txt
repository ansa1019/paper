AbbVie acknowledges that public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, including the COVID-19 crisis, have had and could in the future have an adverse impact on its operations and financial condition, prompting the company to modify its business practices—such as instituting remote work for employees—and to take further actions as required by government authorities or as deemed in the best interests of its employees, patients, customers and business partners; to mitigate operational disruptions, AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply-chain resources worldwide to help ensure uninterrupted patient access to medicines and monitors clinical trial sites locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees.  Recognizing the risk posed by reliance on single-source suppliers and third-party service providers for critical raw materials and manufacturing, AbbVie maintains business interruption insurance, conducts ongoing oversight of key partners, and factors anticipated credit losses and payment histories into its allowances for receivables, while preserving liquidity through a five-year revolving credit facility and active access to debt and commercial paper markets.  In response to intellectual property and market challenges, AbbVie vigorously defends its patents, allocates significant resources to litigation and administrative proceedings, and invests in continuing regulatory compliance programs to reduce the likelihood of enforcement actions that could substantially modify its manufacturing or marketing practices.  Following its Allergan acquisition, the company implemented an integration plan designed to optimize and reconfigure research­and­development, commercial, manufacturing and support functions to realize annual cost synergies through targeted severance, employee benefit expenses and other integration costs, thereby strengthening its ability to preserve or improve functioning under evolving internal and external pressures.  AbbVie’s strategic use of collaborations and joint ventures in its pipeline, combined with significant investments in employee recruitment and retention, reflects an emphasis on inter­organizational collaboration, human capital development and future orientation as mechanisms for sustaining performance, adaptability and organizational coherence in the face of environmental turbulence, regulatory variability and disruptive events.

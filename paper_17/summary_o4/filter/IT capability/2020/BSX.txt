Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we mobilized a global crisis management team to protect employees and customers, optimize operations and secure our supply chain, successfully implementing business-continuity plans including a medical advisory group, work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing, prioritization of critical sales visits and expanded remote physician support. We temporarily closed or scaled back manufacturing sites and instituted cost-reduction measures—reductions in travel, events, hiring, clinical programs and R&D projects, a temporary four-day workweek and executive pay cuts—to align resources with rapidly changing demand while preserving operational flexibility. In returning personnel to our facilities, we adopted a tiered approach that prioritized essential onsite roles and sustained remote work where feasible, ensuring maximum social distancing. Although low production levels exerted downward pressure on gross margins, we achieved manufacturing cost reductions through process-improvement programs and maintained liquidity by accessing committed credit lines, refinancing debt and slowing capital expenditures. We continue to monitor economic, industry and market dynamics, assessing opportunities to enhance operational effectiveness, align expenses with revenues and reinvest savings in strategic growth initiatives. We regularly evaluate asset recoverability, manage legal and supply-chain risks, uphold stringent quality and IT controls and execute restructuring and optimization actions to maintain stability and adapt performance under challenging internal and external conditions.

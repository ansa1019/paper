Berkshire and its subsidiaries employ comprehensive risk mitigation and organizational resilience measures, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid cyber-attacks, terrorist acts and other internal or external variations. Operating on an unusually decentralized basis, qualified and competent management directs day-to-day activities and adapts resource allocation to changing business or regulatory environments, supported by a board-approved succession plan for critical personnel such as the chairman and chief investment decision-makers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses implemented resilience strategies—temporarily closing retail stores, manufacturing facilities and service centers not subject to mandated closure; instituting work-from-home and staggered work schedules; enhancing cleaning, sanitation and employee health screenings; eliminating non-essential travel; and issuing health reminders—while undertaking employee furloughs, wage and salary reductions, capital spending reductions and restructuring activities to align operations with expected customer demand, mitigate economic losses and preserve liquidity. Essential operations such as the railroad and utilities leveraged productivity improvements, operational flexibility and a $135 billion cash and short-term investment liquidity buffer to maintain service continuity, demonstrating a systemic perspective and adaptive capabilities to sustain performance, manage unforeseen disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

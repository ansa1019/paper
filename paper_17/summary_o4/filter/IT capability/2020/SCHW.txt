Schwab has established a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, approved by its board of directors and grounded in its purpose, vision, and values, that assigns senior management and a global risk committee—and their functional sub-committees—responsibility for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and mitigating a full spectrum of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, liquidity, cybersecurity, fraud, model, conduct, and fiduciary risks, through policies, procedures, periodic self-assessments, control testing, and internal audits.  The firm conducts regular liquidity and capital stress testing, maintains contingency plans for low-probability/high-impact events, and manages diversified funding sources, secured credit facilities, and capital buffers to preserve liquidity and avoid forced asset sales at depressed values under adverse conditions.  Its business continuity and disaster recovery program features backup and recovery infrastructure, redundant communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, routine testing of recovery plans, and a formal incident management process to sustain critical operations regardless of incident duration.  Schwab also continuously adjusts interest-rate sensitivity through balance sheet simulations and scenario analysis, aligns risk exposure following acquisitions such as TD Ameritrade, and has instituted dedicated working groups to manage major market transitions—such as the phase-out of LIBOR—thereby reinforcing its ability to maintain integrity and performance and achieve positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

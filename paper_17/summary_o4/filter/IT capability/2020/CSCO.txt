Cisco describes how the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures have placed unprecedented strain on its operations and those of its customers and suppliers—affecting supply chains through manufacturing challenges, component constraints, transportation restrictions, travel bans, quarantines and social distancing orders—and how it has responded by monitoring the pandemic, taking actions in accordance with relevant authorities, shifting the majority of its workforce to a flexible work-from-home model while safeguarding onsite employees, increasing procurement efforts to manage component shortages, realigning resources and expense levels toward key priority areas (including security, applications and intent-based networking), and launching a $2.5 billion business resiliency financing program that provides customers and partners with deferred payment options to support continuity; it further highlights investments in engineering, sales, service and marketing, integration of intent-based, automated, secure networking platforms to empower customers’ digital business transformations, and disciplined cash, credit and capital allocation practices—all intended to absorb internal and external pressures, maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, preserve or improve functioning, and reconfigure the organization for future adaptability and sustained performance.

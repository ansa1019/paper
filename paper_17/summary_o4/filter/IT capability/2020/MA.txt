The company notes that the global COVID-19 pandemic and governmental containment measures have significantly disrupted its operations and those of its customers, prompting it to modify business practices, including employee travel policies, employee work locations and remote-working arrangements, and to stand ready to take further actions in the interests of employees, customers and partners under uncertain conditions. It emphasizes that its proprietary multi-rail payments network and integrated value-added services are designed to offer customers choice, flexibility, safety and security and to maintain operational continuity in the face of external pressures, regulatory changes and cybersecurity threats. To preserve or improve performance and guard against errors, failures and service interruptions, the company maintains an enterprise resiliency program to identify and assess risks, analyze potential impacts and develop effective response strategies, deploys privacy-by-design and data-by-design approaches in product development, and implements information security controls and cyber-threat mitigation measures. The company also actively manages transaction-processing and settlement guarantees, monitors foreign-currency and settlement exposures, hedges a portion of its transactional currency risk, and evaluates indemnification obligations to safeguard liquidity and ensure uninterrupted clearing and settlement even under adverse economic or customer liquidity events. In support of these resilience efforts, it continually reallocates financial and human resources toward strategic investments in network infrastructure, technology enhancements, data analytics, consulting and security capabilities, adapts its product rollout and customer-onboarding processes, and maintains available cash balances, investment securities and credit facilities to absorb strain, reconstitute operations after disruptions and preserve or enhance functioning despite evolving external demands.

We maintain comprehensive disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of disruptive events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, pandemics and other exceptional conditions, and regularly review, upgrade and enhance our policies, procedures and systems to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging circumstances. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we activated our business continuity plan in March 2020, shifted over 98% of our workforce to work-from-home or off-site locations to ensure uninterrupted service to clients, deployed digital implementation and servicing initiatives to adapt our operating model, implemented over 1,000 product feature changes in response to some 2,000 legislative updates across 60 countries, and leveraged our liquidity resources—including $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities, our commercial paper program, reverse repurchase agreements and corporate cash balances—to manage funding requirements for both corporate purposes and client funds obligations. We devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our information security and controls, risk-based anti-money laundering and compliance programs, and data protection measures, and we employ a laddered investment strategy for client-funds assets—supported by short-term financing arrangements—to average through interest-rate cycles and ensure the integrity and availability of client funds. Our broad-based transformation initiatives, including workforce optimization, procurement transformation and next-generation platform investments, are designed to streamline our organization, extend distribution, strengthen talent and culture, and improve operational flexibility, while our ongoing investments in research and development and strategic foresight support our ability to reconfigure processes, mitigate emerging risks and maintain performance and organizational health under external pressures.

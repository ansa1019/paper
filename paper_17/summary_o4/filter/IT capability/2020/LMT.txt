Lockheed Martin routinely identifies, monitors and assesses risks to the technical, schedule and cost aspects of its long-term contracts, revises profit‐booking rates as conditions improve or deteriorate, and re-forecasts total costs to complete—establishing provisions when necessary to preserve contractual performance. The company maintains a balanced cash deployment strategy, securing liquidity through strong operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities and judicious debt management to sustain operations and fund capital investments, R&D and strategic acquisitions, while ensuring progress payment flexibility and accelerated supplier payments to stabilize its supplier base. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Lockheed Martin implemented site-access controls, social distancing protocols, personal protective equipment provisions, remote work arrangements and temporary work schedule adjustments (notably on the F-35 production line) to safeguard employee health and maintain production continuity. It also works closely with customers and suppliers to mitigate supply chain disruptions, diversify sourcing where single-sourced components present risk and adapt flight-test and sustainment schedules as necessary. Enterprise-wide, the company leverages scenario planning, ongoing contract negotiations for equitable adjustments, and advanced forecasting of government funding to ensure business continuity under constrained budgets and evolving external pressures. These measures support rapid recovery, sustained performance under pressure and adaptability to disruptive events.

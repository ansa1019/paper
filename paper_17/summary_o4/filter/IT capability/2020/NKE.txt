Nike’s 10-K disclosures highlight the company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity by detailing a broad spectrum of risk mitigation and business continuity measures, including advanced hygiene and safety protocols, social-distancing adaptations, cyber-security defenses, and redundancy in information technology and supply-chain systems to forestall and recover from internal or external disturbances such as health epidemics, natural disasters, geopolitical unrest, manufacturing disruptions, and logistics constraints.  The report describes Nike’s “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” in its rapid response to COVID-19 through temporary closure of approximately 90 percent of its owned stores, accelerated expansion of digital commerce supported by enhanced distribution-center operations, shifts in buying plans and customer payment terms, targeted promotions and markdowns to liquidate excess inventory, factory cancellation processes, and the reconfiguration of product trajectories toward future demand.  Nike further underscores its strategic resilience by reinforcing liquidity via new committed credit facilities and senior unsecured notes, hedging currency and commodity exposures, continually optimizing working capital, and reallocating resources to end-to-end digital capabilities—data and analytics, demand sensing, inventory management, enterprise resource planning and digital experiences—while restructuring regional operating models and distributor partnerships to strengthen adaptability, preserve organizational integrity, and sustain performance in turbulent markets.

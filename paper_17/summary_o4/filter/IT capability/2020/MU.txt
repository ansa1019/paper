The Company’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by implementing extensive business continuity and risk mitigation measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and other disruptive events. These include the enactment of physical-distancing measures at global locations—such as requiring work from home, limiting the number of on-site personnel and meeting attendees, enforcing quarantines of at-risk team members, contractors, and vendors, conducting thermal health screenings, and mandating masks at all times—together with upgrades to facility equipment, enhanced cleaning protocols, and increased use of personal protective equipment to safeguard employee health and preserve operational integrity. In support of supply-chain resilience, the Company has evaluated its supplier network to identify potential gaps, added alternative suppliers, increased on-hand inventory of critical raw materials, shifted shipments from declining to growing markets, and expanded assembly and test capacity through captive operations and external partners to provide redundant manufacturing capability. The Company has also developed and implemented scenario-based strategic initiatives—such as restrictions on new hiring, curtailment of business travel, and reductions in discretionary spending—and continuously monitors operations in collaboration with government authorities to ensure compliance with evolving mandates, regulations, industry standards, and best practices. These actions, together with ongoing evaluation of construction projects, capital expenditure allocation, and production technology transitions, reflect a systemic perspective on resource allocation, risk assessment, adaptation strategies, and operational flexibility designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functionality in the face of public health crises, trade restrictions, economic downturns, environmental disturbances, or other internal or external pressures.

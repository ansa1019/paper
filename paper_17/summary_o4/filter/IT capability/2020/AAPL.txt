The Form 10-K describes a range of organizational responses and operational adaptations designed to preserve integrity and performance under adverse conditions, including monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and taking appropriate actions under authorities’ recommendations, temporarily closing and safely reopening retail stores and partner points of sale, imposing health and safety restrictions, and requiring substantially all employees to work remotely; it discloses disruptions to manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners that resulted in temporary iPhone shortages and emphasizes its dependence on single-source and limited-source suppliers as a risk to its flexibility to respond to changing conditions, prompting investments in manufacturing process equipment, long-term supply prepayments and non-cancelable purchase obligations and leases, while acknowledging that severe supplier disruptions could reduce or terminate supply and impair the recoverability of these assets; it maintains system redundancy, business continuity and disaster recovery planning, devotes significant resources to network and data security, encryption and monitoring for unusual activity yet recognizes these measures may be insufficient for all eventualities and that unauthorized access could materially impact its operations and reputation; it relies on a diversified liquidity framework—cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper and derivative instruments to hedge currency and interest rate exposures—asserting these financial resources support working capital, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases and debt repayments; it organizes its operations into distinct geographic segments to align management with local market dynamics, makes focused R&D investments to sustain competitive positioning, applies management judgment in revenue recognition and valuation estimates, and implements policies and procedures for regulatory compliance, while acknowledging that legal contingencies, macroeconomic pressures, supply chain vulnerabilities, regulatory changes and security incidents could impair its performance or require significant recovery efforts.

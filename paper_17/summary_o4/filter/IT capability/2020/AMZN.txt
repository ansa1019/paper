In our risk factors the Company acknowledges that unanticipated events and uncertainties – including the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather, natural or man-made disasters, system interruptions, supplier disruptions, geopolitical events, and evolving government regulations – could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. We recognize that volatility in product and service demand places increased strain on our operations, requiring scalable fulfillment network capacity, flexible staffing of fulfillment and customer service centers, rapid adjustment of inventory levels, and optimization of data center and logistics processes. The complexity inherent in expanding global operations, integrating new products, services, and geographies, and operating across cross-functional systems may challenge process efficiency, forecast accuracy, and growth management, and could limit our ability to operate networks effectively or adjust spending promptly. Our disaster recovery planning and system redundancy may prove insufficient to prevent system interruptions, data loss, or service delays, any of which could damage our reputation and incur significant costs. We depend on key management and technical personnel, third-party shipping companies, suppliers, strategic partners, and commercial agreements that require robust infrastructure and resource allocation; failures or delays in these relationships may impede our ability to deliver products and services and negatively affect results. In response to the pandemic, we modified logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing, and third-party seller processes and incurred significant COVID-19-related costs to enhance workplace safety and maintain operations. We continue to invest in technology infrastructure, content development, process automation, and cost-reduction initiatives – including strengthening variable cost management, leveraging fixed costs, reducing unit costs through scale, and extending low-cost shipping offers – to sustain performance under challenging conditions and preserve system integrity while pursuing long-term, sustainable growth.

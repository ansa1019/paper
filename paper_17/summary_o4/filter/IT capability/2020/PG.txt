The company’s 10‐K describes numerous measures that align with the concept of organizational resilience, including its global supply chain and manufacturing continuity programs designed to “maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements” despite “natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control,” and its business continuity plans for IT/OT systems and networks to guard against “cybersecurity breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns” that could interrupt its “ship-make-process” operations. It details strategic risk mitigation and emergency management processes—such as negotiating extended payment terms, deploying supply chain finance, conducting risk assessments and maintaining diversified cash, investment securities and credit facilities—to “absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning” in the face of currency fluctuations, trade barriers, economic volatility and political instability. The report further highlights productivity and cost-savings initiatives across supply chain, R&D, marketing and overhead, with reinvestments in product and packaging innovation to offset cost pressures and sustain margins, and structural organization changes—sector business units with profit responsibility, enterprise markets, corporate functions and global business services—to enhance operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration, leadership succession and coordinated response strategies. The company’s pandemic disclosures underscore its crisis agency and adaptive strategies—protecting employee health, maximizing product availability for consumer health, hygiene and cleaning needs, working with authorities to keep facilities open, and adjusting manufacturing, distribution and digital channels—to “respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger,” thereby demonstrating a systemic perspective on maintaining integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional disturbances.

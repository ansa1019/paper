Intuit’s 2020 Form 10-K acknowledges that its businesses routinely encounter and address risks under nominal, extreme, and exceptional conditions, emphasizing that the manner in which it responds to future developments as well as competitors’ reactions may materially affect its future operating results, revenue, cash flows and reputation. The company notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant global economic instability and uncertainty, negatively impacting customer demand, consumer spending, payment volumes and the number and timing of tax filings, and warns that reduction in customer demand, decreased consumer spending levels, reduced small business payment volumes and payrolls and changes in filing deadlines could materially harm its results of operations. Changes to its business operations and those of its third-party partners—such as increased use of videoconferencing, the shift to working from home, and the complexity of resuming office operations—have introduced new security and execution risks, while potential disruption of services on which it relies to deliver critical services could prevent it or its service providers from fulfilling customer orders or accepting and completing transactions. It cautions that increased, divergent and changing governmental regulations, including shelter-in-place orders and closures of work facilities, schools and public buildings, could make it considerably more difficult to develop, enhance and support its products and services. Intuit may be unable to obtain financing in the current economic environment on favorable terms, which could impair its cash flows and restrict its ability to execute strategic initiatives and react to environmental disruptions. The company hosts, collects, uses and retains large amounts of sensitive customer and workforce data and, despite significant investments in security technologies and controls and collaboration with state and federal governments to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures—including sharing information regarding suspicious filings—such protections cannot provide absolute security; unauthorized access or fraudulent activity—even if not resulting in a breach—may undermine customer confidence, damage its reputation and limit adoption of its offerings. It warns that business interruption or failure of its information technology and communications systems, or those of its public cloud and other external service providers, could impair the availability of its products and services, lead to loss of data or processing capabilities, require refunds of fees, and result in customer attrition, financial losses and material harm to its reputation. Noting that it does not have redundancy for all systems and that its disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities, Intuit indicates that vulnerabilities arising from natural disasters, human error, cyberattacks or health emergencies could disrupt its business operations. It has modified its business practices—including employee travel restrictions, work-from-home measures and cancellation of physical participation in meetings and events—and may take further actions as needed, yet there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate risks without impairing its ability to perform critical functions. The complexity of resuming office operations could introduce new execution risks and longer-term disruptions. To preserve liquidity, Intuit has borrowed under and repaid its unsecured revolving credit facility, issued senior unsecured notes and maintains a secured revolving credit facility to fund small business loans, all subject to customary covenants, and indicates that based on past performance and current expectations its cash, cash equivalents and investments should be sufficient to meet seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, debt service requirements and other liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. The company regularly invests resources to update and improve its internal technology systems, software platforms, network security and high-availability capabilities, but warns that delays, unforeseen difficulties or unsuccessful implementations could result in outages, disruption of operations, inability to deliver or enhance offerings, loss of revenue and reputational damage, while its growth increasingly depends on the strength of its third-party business relationships—some sole-source—and adverse changes or failures by these partners or distribution platforms could materially affect its ability to support customers and maintain strategic agility under challenging conditions.

During 2020, AMD maintained business continuity under the disruptive conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic by operating critical on-site functions in locations where public-health measures permitted and transitioning most employees to remote work, while continuously monitoring governmental health directives and adapting its operations accordingly.  The company regularly assessed demand signals and adjusted its supply-chain requirements to align with evolving customer needs and geographic market shifts, and updated product schedules and roadmaps to support remote working requirements and emergent market dynamics.  Despite ongoing pandemic-related constraints, AMD delivered strong financial results and extended its industry-leading product portfolio, reflecting its technical, operational and financial resilience.  To preserve its integrity and performance under internal and external pressures, AMD hedges portions of its short-term foreign currency exposure, leverages relationships with third-party wafer foundries and logistics providers to secure sufficient manufacturing capacity and distribution, and maintains a cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance, together with a revolving credit facility, deemed sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months.  These strategic resource-allocation, risk-mitigation and operational-flexibility measures demonstrate AMDâ€™s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure its trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

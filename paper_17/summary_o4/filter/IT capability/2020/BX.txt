These disclosures reflect efforts consistent with scholars’ definition of organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007: 3418) and focus on processes to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns, the majority of our employees globally have been working remotely in accordance with local government guidance and social distancing recommendations, and while our technology infrastructure has supported remote work, such working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the pandemic. Our operations are highly dependent on the information systems and technology infrastructure that supports our business, and a disaster or disruption in that infrastructure—whether from a cybersecurity incident or otherwise, including electronic communications failures or other service interruptions—could materially impair our ability to operate without interruption. Although we have implemented disaster recovery and business continuity programs, these may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm from such disruptions. We have also become increasingly reliant on third-party service providers for fund administration, cloud-based services and technology, and any failure or deterioration of their systems or operations could impair our operations and those of our consolidated funds and damage our reputation. We periodically rely on complex regulatory exemptions—such as those under Rule 506 of Regulation D—and in certain instances depend on third-party compliance, and our inability to satisfy these requirements could expose us to regulatory action or third-party claims. We are regularly subject to requests for information and investigations by the SEC and other regulatory authorities, including audits of fee and expense allocation, valuation practices and conflict-of-interest policies; such reviews have in the past and may in the future result in sanctions or operational restrictions that could harm our reputation and ability to pursue strategic initiatives. During periods of difficult market and economic conditions—including disruptions in credit markets and global financial markets—we may be compelled to reduce fixed costs and adapt our cost structure to preserve business continuity; a failure to manage or reduce expenses in a timely fashion, or to access credit or capital markets on acceptable terms, would adversely affect our operating performance. Moreover, in conducting due diligence on potential investments, we rely on information from third parties, which may be incomplete or inaccurate, and may not identify future developments that could materially impair portfolio value. These policies and practices exemplify our efforts to allocate resources, adapt processes, mitigate risk and maintain organizational health and functioning under internal or external pressures, consistent with the need for positive adjustment and resilience.

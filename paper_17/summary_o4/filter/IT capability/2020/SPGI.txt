In its Form 10-K, S&P Global discloses that its business continuity program “has been effective to date,” noting that since mid-March 2020 nearly all employees have been working remotely and the Company “has been able to continue our operations during this time,” although extended remote operations may adversely affect productivity and client service and expose the firm to operational risks. It reports diverting information technology resources to sustain the remote working infrastructure, which “limits the resources available for improvement and innovation projects,” and acknowledges increased cyber vulnerability, with “an increase in cyber threats targeted at our remote work environment.” The risk factors warn that in addition to COVID-19, a disaster or business continuity problem—“such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, … power loss, telecommunications failure …” or other event—“could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.” The Company states that “we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession” and maintains disaster recovery plans and backup facilities for its primary data centers, yet acknowledges these systems “are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective.” It cautions that reliance on network systems and third-party infrastructure—“outsourcing … functions,” “cloud” services and “the business infrastructure and systems of third parties”—exposes it to risks of service disruption, data unavailability and security breaches, any of which “could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.” Finally, the report notes that “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability” and that “our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, … malicious or defective software, human error” or regulatory constraints.

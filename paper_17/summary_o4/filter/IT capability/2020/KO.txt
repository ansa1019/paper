In facing the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including sales declines, supply-chain disruptions and constraints on concentrate production, the company activated comprehensive resilience strategies to preserve system integrity and maintain performance under extreme conditions, embodying the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions: it deployed global and regional risk-management teams to monitor evolving health, regulatory and market developments; adopted business-continuity measures such as enhanced employee health screenings, remote-work protocols, additional sanitization and travel restrictions; implemented knowledge-sharing routines across the network to manage bottling and packaging disruptions; accelerated strategic initiatives to “emerge stronger” through disciplined resource reallocation—prioritizing a defined portfolio of high-potential brands, streamlining scalable innovation pipelines and refreshing marketing investments for greater effectiveness; invested in new e-commerce capabilities and data-driven revenue-growth management to capture lasting shifts in consumer behavior; and transformed its organizational structure and franchising model—through voluntary and involuntary workforce adjustments, productivity and reinvestment programs and refranchising of bottling territories—to reconfigure resource deployment, optimize supply-chain efficiency and enhance operational flexibility. These multifaceted actions reflect a systemic perspective on resilience, encompassing dynamic adaptation to environmental perturbations, crisis response protocols, inter-organizational collaboration with bottling partners and continuous pursuit of productivity improvements and innovation to safeguard organizational health, competitive advantage and long-term growth trajectories in a volatile business environment.

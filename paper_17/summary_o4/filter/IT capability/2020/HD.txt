Our annual report emphasizes that our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those not presently known, which could impair operations and the trading value of our securities, and that the success of our strategic investments—such as building one supply chain and the one Home Depot experience—depends on effectively managing the volume, timing, nature, and cost of substantial real estate, process, and information technology projects designed to streamline operations, simplify customer interactions, and create an interconnected shopping and delivery network. We recognize that our ability to identify and adapt promptly to evolving consumer trends, manage appropriate inventory levels, maintain high in-stock positions amid surges in demand and commodity price volatility, and invest in associate pay, benefits, training, and retention is critical to preserving service quality and operational flexibility. We describe substantial investments in our information systems—including legacy-system replacements, cloud migrations, cybersecurity measures, and ongoing process and control enhancements—to collect, analyze, and protect transactional and operational data, while acknowledging that damage or interruption from natural disasters, cyber-attacks, pandemics, or other disruptions could impair data security, disrupt customer-facing platforms, and require resource-intensive remediation. The report details the resilience challenges posed by disruptions in our logistics and supply chain network—from labor shortages, port congestion, trade disputes, or public health measures—and the need for risk management frameworks and inter-organizational collaboration with suppliers to maintain timely product availability, manage operational costs, and protect our reputation. We also outline the complexities and integration risks of strategic transactions and supplier alliances, the necessity of maintaining compliance with evolving regulations in data privacy, payment processing, and labor laws, and the importance of preserving sufficient liquidity and diversified credit facilities—through commercial paper programs, revolving credit facilities, and senior notes—to ensure operational continuity, fund capital expenditures, dividends, and share repurchases, and maintain financial flexibility in volatile or extreme conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, we adjusted store hours, limited customer traffic, implemented curbside pickup, shifted support operations to remote models, expanded associate pay and benefits, and adopted localized customer-limit protocols and mask requirements to safeguard associates and customers while sustaining our interconnected retail strategy. We affirm our commitment to ongoing monitoring of emerging risks, proactive organizational change processes, and management transitions, and we believe that our prior investments in stores, digital assets, supply chain, and merchandising organization have enhanced our ability to absorb strain, maintain performance, and adapt effectively under challenging and exceptional conditions.

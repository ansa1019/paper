Netflix has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government mandates by altering operations, shifting a significant portion of our workforce to remote work, curtailing travel, and resuming productions where feasible while acknowledging ongoing disruptions to content development, supply chains and vendor operations. We continue to actively monitor public health measures, regulatory requirements and economic impacts, and may further modify business operations, including content production schedules and workforce deployment, to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, although the timing, costs and impacts on revenues, capacity and capital access remain uncertain. To support operational flexibility and business continuity, we have scaled our streaming service and international offerings through the development and refinement of proprietary technology, utilization of third-party cloud-computing and content-delivery networks, and the expansion of cross-functional expertise in creative, marketing, legal, finance and licensing disciplines. We manage the complexity of global content licensing and production by adjusting systems and practices to varied cultural, regulatory and partner environments, broadening relationships with existing partners and pursuing new agreements to ensure service availability across diverse devices, networks and geographies. Recognizing risks from supply constraints, vendor insolvencies, fixed-cost content commitments and substantial indebtedness, we maintain liquidity through cash flows, revolving credit facilities and strategic capital issuance while monitoring and mitigating exposure to cost fluctuations, foreign exchange, interest rate changes and contractual obligations. Robust cybersecurity, payment-processing resilience and compliance with evolving data-privacy regulations underpin our efforts to protect system integrity, secure member and employee information, and mitigate potential disruptions arising from natural disasters, cyber-attacks, network operator practices and regulatory changes. Governance mechanisms and human capital strategies, including engagement with collective bargaining stakeholders and retention of key executives, further support our ability to adapt, maintain continuity and pursue strategic initiatives under internal and external pressures, preserving organizational functioning and positioning Netflix to respond effectively to environmental perturbations and emerge stronger from adversity.

Accenture’s 2020 Form 10-K describes how the company absorbed strain and preserved operational continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic by swiftly enabling approximately 95 percent of its workforce to work remotely, suspending travel, and implementing phased return-to-office plans driven by safety and client requirements, demonstrating its ability to adjust positively under exceptional, disruptive conditions. The report details how government-imposed travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, social distancing measures and office closures substantially curtailed business activities, weakened economic conditions and disrupted Accenture’s ability to sell and deliver services, thereby magnifying other risks and underscoring the importance of its business continuity and disaster recovery plans. To maintain performance and competitiveness under these external pressures, Accenture realigned its global delivery model—concentrated in India and the Philippines—redeployed employees from lower-demand practices to high-demand projects, invested in reskilling and retention initiatives to keep pace with rapid technological and industry changes, and adjusted hiring, involuntary terminations and compensation to balance skills and resources with client demand, illustrating resource reconfiguration, operational flexibility and absorptive capacity. The company’s growth strategy emphasizes digital, cloud and security innovations and adaptive pricing and commercial models to address evolving client needs and technological disruptions, supporting service innovation and transformation while safeguarding margins. Financial resilience is managed through currency hedging programs to mitigate exchange-rate variability, cost-management strategies to align workforce costs with revenue forecasts, and rigorous forecasting of contract effort, cost and complexity to avoid delivery inefficiencies. Risk mitigation extends to robust internal controls over financial and tax reporting, continuous assessment of legal and regulatory compliance across diverse jurisdictions, cybersecurity protocols to protect critical information systems, and the management of alliances, acquisitions and joint ventures with post-transaction integration and oversight, all of which reflect a systemic perspective on maintaining integrity, performance and competitive advantage in the face of volatility, uncertainty and adversity.

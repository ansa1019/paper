Throughout the annual report, the company discloses a broad set of strategies and resources designed to absorb strain and preserve operational performance under uncertain and adverse conditions, including the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, supply chain disruptions, volatile economic and regulatory environments, and evolving security threats. These measures encompass substantial and ongoing investments in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery planning; enhancements to its U.S. ground network and deployment of digital access platforms to adapt to shifts in e-commerce demand; indexed fuel surcharges and hedging transactions to mitigate energy-price and currency fluctuations; activity-based costing refinements to improve resource allocation across its integrated air and ground operations; self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs supported by actuarial estimates to contain adverse financial impacts from cargo loss, personal injury and other liabilities; workforce management practices focused on attracting, training and retaining a large and diverse global workforce while controlling labor costs; disciplined capital commitments for aircraft, vehicles, facilities and technology to ensure both replacement and growth capacity; ongoing transformation and integration initiatives, including the planned divestiture of UPS Freight to reconfigure the asset base toward core, higher-value services; and the use of supplemental non-GAAP performance metrics to align management decision-making with the strategic pursuit of sustaining service quality, financial strength and system integrity across a turbulent and evolving global business environment.

The risk factors disclosure emphasizes that we face internal and external variations and disturbances, including the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, wildfires and related power shut-offs, as well as government-imposed travel bans, quarantines, work-from-home directives and shelter-in-place orders, all of which have caused business slowdowns or shutdowns and materially affected our operating results, cash flows and ability to develop, support and deliver our services; in response, we rely on existing crisis management and disaster response plans, disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, alternate facilities or arrangements, and strategic realignments to redirect resources toward critical functions and scale our operations, while noting the risk of strain on our personnel resources and infrastructure, adverse impacts on employee productivity, and the potential inability to adequately plan for or manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements; we further acknowledge our dependency on third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and the internetâ€™s fragmented infrastructure, the possibility of security breaches or defects disrupting our services, and our ongoing efforts to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes, internal security controls and regular oversight by our board, audit committee and executive management, all intended to preserve or improve functioning and firm performance under challenging conditions, absorb strain, mitigate risks, adapt to unexpected situations, and maintain organizational integrity and operational continuity in the face of adversity.

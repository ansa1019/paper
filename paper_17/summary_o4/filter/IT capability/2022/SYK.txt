The Company’s 2022 Form 10-K discloses a comprehensive set of capabilities and practices aimed at maintaining functionality and adapting positively under adverse conditions, including reliance on global supply chains and sole‐source suppliers—with recognition that “significant shortages, price increases or unavailability of third-party services could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products”—augmented by proactive supply chain risk management, pre-buying critical raw materials and contingency planning to “move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand.” The report describes efforts to mitigate inflationary pressures, labor shortages and pricing constraints imposed by government and private sector initiatives, and to manage ongoing disruptions from geopolitical events and the COVID-19 pandemic by adjusting operations when elective procedures were suspended, navigating delays and component shortages, and responding to shifting customer demand. Investments in information technology systems, cybersecurity defenses, incident response protocols and business continuity plans are highlighted as essential to preserving system integrity and preventing “reputational, competitive and business harm,” while the implementation of a new global ERP system, recruitment and retention of key personnel, and maintenance of an inclusive culture and operational flexibility reflect organizational foresight and adaptability. Strategic initiatives related to acquisitions and integrations—including allocation of resources to realize expected benefits, adjustment of contingent consideration when milestones are unlikely to be achieved, and the impairment of underperforming assets—demonstrate the Company’s capacity to reconfigure trajectories in response to disruptive events. The Company also maintains insurance programs for property, casualty and cybersecurity losses, and acknowledges climate-related risks whereby increased frequency and severity of natural disasters “could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions, damage to our products and facilities … [and] increased costs of raw materials and components,” thereby necessitating further mitigation measures to preserve performance under pressure.

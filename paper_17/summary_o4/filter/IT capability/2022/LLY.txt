The company’s disclosures reflect a systematic approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continuously evaluating and securing liquidity through operating cash flow generation, access to commercial paper and committed credit facilities, and a balanced mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt hedged via interest rate swaps, as well as mitigating foreign-exchange volatility through forward and option contracts; managing research and development spending across a diversified pipeline so that delays or terminations of individual projects do not materially disrupt total R&D investment; pursuing a multifaceted business development strategy—licensing, co-development, joint ventures, acquisitions and equity investments—to strengthen its product portfolio while acknowledging integration challenges, contingent milestone and royalty obligations, and the potential for unpredictable outcomes; adapting manufacturing and supply operations in response to intermittent order fulfillment delays and fluctuating demand for incretin products by prioritizing existing patient continuity, expanding internal and contract manufacturing capacity globally, and committing billions in capital investments in new facilities; and enacting risk management protocols and organizational measures during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect employee health, support medical systems and community access to medicines amid cost inflation and logistics strains, thereby demonstrating the ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve overall functioning and performance under internal and external pressures.

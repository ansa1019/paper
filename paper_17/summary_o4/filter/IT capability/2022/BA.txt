Our annual report describes our reliance on the coordinated integration of U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and highly skilled labor, as well as our ongoing monitoring of supply chain health and stability, to adapt production rates on key programs, minimize disruption from production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in the face of inflationary pressures, labor instability, pandemics and other external disturbances. We recognize that unplanned events such as pandemics, regulatory reforms or production quality issues may require extensive inspections, rework of built and stored aircraft, adjustments to accounting quantities, reach-forward loss provisions and customer considerations, all of which we reassess quarterly in our program accounting estimates of revenue, cost and profit margins. To mitigate risks to business continuity and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, we maintain extensive technical security controls, a cybersecurity governance council and enterprise-wide risk management processes to address evolving cyber threats and business disruptions, as well as contingency liquidity in the form of cash, short-term investments and undrawn revolving credit facilities. We engage in industrial participation agreements to support local supplier networks, provision for environmental remediation liabilities and establish publicly-announced sustainability and emissions goals, while managing defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations according to actuarial assumptions to ensure long-term financial resilience. Our disciplined approach to resource allocation, strategic agility, risk assessment and recovery mechanisms reflects our shared commitment to absorb strain, preserve and improve functioning despite adversity, and maintain integrity and performance across our global operations.

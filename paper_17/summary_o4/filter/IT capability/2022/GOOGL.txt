The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to a range of internal and external pressures, requiring ongoing investments in business continuity and system resilience, including significant capital expenditures for technical infrastructure and data center capacity, implementation of disaster recovery planning—though such plans cannot account for all eventualities—and the maintenance of redundant information technology and communications systems to mitigate risks from natural disasters, pandemics, power loss, terrorism, or cyber attacks. To preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, we continuously monitor and adjust our supply chain by engaging contract manufacturers, managing inventory commitments, and securing alternative sourcing to address potential component shortages, geopolitical tensions, and climate-related disruptions. Through hedging programs and foreign currency risk management, we endeavor to absorb fluctuations in exchange rates while maintaining operational flexibility in international markets. Our risk mitigation strategies include ongoing investments in cybersecurity, safety and content review efforts to combat misuse of our platforms, and acquisitions such as Mandiant to enhance dynamic cyber defense and incident response capabilities. Organizational changes, including integration of new businesses and technologies, workforce reductions, and real estate optimization, are managed through structured change management processes, resource reallocation, and assessments of useful lives of key assets to maintain fiscal integrity and performance under challenging conditions. Moreover, we assess and accrue for contingent liabilities and legal exposures as part of our comprehensive risk assessment framework, preserving organizational health and enabling positive adjustment under uncertainty.

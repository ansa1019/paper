The company discloses that its “inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability,” noting that “if we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, war or other geopolitical tensions, … our ability to operate will depend, in part, on the continued availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations.”  It emphasizes that “our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage” and that “if a business continuity event occurs, we could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients,” including extended outages with “significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues,” and that “our business disruption insurance may also not fully cover, in type or amount, the cost of a successful recovery.”  The risk factors further explain that the company “collect[s], use[s], store[s], transmit[s] and otherwise process[es] certain electronic information” and “relie[s] on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks,” which are “potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, damage or interruption from a variety of external threats, including weather, natural disaster, war, terrorism, pandemic or other natural or geopolitical event,” and that a cyberattack or continuity event “affecting us or a key vendor … could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations or our ability to recover data.”  The company also identifies the need to “develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change” to protect its business performance and growth plans, and describes “strategic initiatives involving investments in or partnerships with technology companies as part of our growth strategy, as well as investments in technology and infrastructure to support our own systems,” while acknowledging that these “may be costly and require significant capital expenditures, may not deliver the benefits or perform as expected, or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically,” and that dependence on a “large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of our business operations” creates risks that “their decisions or operations may adversely impact us” and that “replacing these service providers could create significant delay in services or operations and additional expense.”  Moreover, the company warns that “geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, including conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, slower GDP growth or recession, capital markets volatility and inflation … may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing,” and that “the ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 … on us will depend on future developments that we are unable to predict,” reflecting the multifaceted pressures under which the company must maintain its functioning and adapt to ensure business continuity and resilience.

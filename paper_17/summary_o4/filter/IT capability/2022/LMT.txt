Lockheed Martin acknowledges that “risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted” and seeks to “identify, manage and mitigate risks” to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid budget uncertainty, government shutdowns, funding delays, supply chain disruptions and evolving customer requirements. The company pursues operational flexibility and business continuity through diversification of its product and service portfolio, long-term supply agreements, alternative sourcing strategies, increased visibility into its multi-tiered supply chain, accelerated payments to small and at-risk suppliers, and targeted investments in digital infrastructure under its multi-year business transformation initiative. It regularly reassesses contract structures—including fixed-price, cost-reimbursable and performance-based payment mechanisms—to maintain cash flow, offset inflationary and cost pressures, and manage working capital. Financial resilience is further supported by proactive debt management, the use of prepayment credits, and pension risk-transfer transactions that transfer obligations to insurers while managing volatility in funded status. Lockheed Martin’s enterprise risk management program encompasses environmental remediation planning, cybersecurity defenses led by a Computer Incident Response Team and counterintelligence efforts, and robust disclosure controls to detect and respond to internal and external threats. The company continually realigns its portfolio through acquisitions, divestitures, and joint ventures to anticipate disruptive change, reconfigure resources toward emerging areas such as hypersonics and classified programs, and sustain competitive advantage. In response to COVID-19 and geopolitical challenges, it implemented health and safety protocols, capacity assessments and supplier support measures to preserve operations. Through integrated risk assessment, adaptive resource deployment, collaborative networks, and strategic foresight, Lockheed Martin maintains its integrity and performance under challenging and dynamic conditions.

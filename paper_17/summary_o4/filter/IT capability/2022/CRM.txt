The company acknowledges that any interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other vendors, or its inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of services, cause performance degradation and materially harm its business and reputation. These risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by its ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, its capacity to escalate and respond to known and potential risks, and regular briefings to its board of directors, cybersecurity and privacy committee and executive management on cybersecurity policies, practices and events. The company’s production environment and customers’ data are replicated in near real time in geographically separate facilities, and certain offerings are served through alternate facilities or arrangements, with disaster recovery and business continuity measures in place. Nevertheless, disruptions resulting from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, wildfires, pandemics, geopolitical developments or similar events could cause lengthy interruptions in services, and no assurance exists that remediation would occur in a timely manner or at reasonable cost. Supply chain constraints, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions in Europe, further complicate infrastructure capacity planning and may strain data center operations. Supporting a rapidly growing global customer base and personnel, including through acquisitions, has placed significant strain on the company’s management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure, requiring substantial investment in human capital, software systems, reporting controls, real estate utilization and management controls to scale operations, increase productivity and meet customer needs. The company regularly upgrades or replaces software systems and processes, but implementation delays or unforeseen problems could negatively impact its ability to manage the business. In January 2023, the company announced a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and advance profitable growth, including workforce reductions and selective real estate exits, while offering its workforce flexible office arrangements; however, these changes may not meet employee expectations and could adversely affect productivity, talent retention and operational continuity. The company’s headquarters and significant operations are located near major seismic faults, and, absent earthquake insurance for direct losses (other than its owned building), a major earthquake or other catastrophic event could necessitate a protracted recovery and materially affect financial condition and operating results. The emergence and persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures have materially changed how the company and its customers operate, have in the past negatively affected operating results and cash flows, and may in the future require alteration, postponement or cancellation of customer, employee and industry events. Natural disasters and climate-related events such as droughts, water scarcity, heat waves, floods, wildfires and associated power shutoffs—both at corporate offices and among remote-working employees—present ongoing risks that may increase attrition, operational losses and costs to maintain or resume operations, despite crisis management and disaster response plans. Evolving industry-specific, regional and global regulations governing data privacy, cybersecurity, antitrust, export and import controls, and environmental, social and governance matters impose additional compliance obligations, reporting requirements and risk assessment processes that increase the complexity and cost of operations. Finally, to support acquisitions or investments, the company may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms and could impair its ability to integrate acquired operations, technologies and personnel effectively, potentially constraining resources and disrupting overall organizational resilience and performance under challenging conditions.

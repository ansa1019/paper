The report details how Analog Devices preserves positive adjustment and continuity under challenging conditions by diversifying and reallocating resources across internal manufacturing facilities in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia while supplementing capacity with third‐party wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors to absorb strain and maintain production when faced with natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest, geopolitical shifts, pandemic disruptions, export restrictions or supplier delays; it describes contingencies such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations, an unsecured revolving credit facility and cash on hand to ensure liquidity, inventory management and hedging strategies to offset supply chain constraints, and organizational measures—including subleasing facilities, workforce realignments, innovation through sustained R&D investment, integration of acquisitions, and dynamic adjustments to manufacturing, sales and administrative processes—to adapt to extreme variations in demand, regulatory changes, economic uncertainties and technological evolution, all intended to sustain or improve functioning, manage risk, and reconfigure trajectories toward future growth despite adversity.

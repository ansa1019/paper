Goldman Sachs maintains comprehensive business continuity and resiliency plans designed to ensure the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through continuous updating of operational systems, systemic controls and employee training to adapt to spikes in transaction volumes, changing regulations and emerging threats. The firm invests in diversification of third-party vendors and pre-funds cash and collateral needs with unencumbered, highly liquid securities, using modeled liquidity outflows, intraday liquidity measures and longer-term stress scenarios to quantify potential losses under severe market and firm-specific stress events. Its governance framework integrates scenario analyses, triggers and alerts in recovery and resolution planning, stress testing of capital and liquidity, and proactive risk—encompassing operational, cyber, market, credit and compliance—management processes to reconstitute and reconfigure strategic responses, mitigate the impact of infrastructure failures, cyber attacks, pandemics, natural disasters or geopolitical disruptions, and thereby preserve organizational integrity, performance and strategic capacity during extreme conditions.

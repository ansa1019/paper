The companyâ€™s risk disclosures highlight its deployment of crisis management plans and contingency measures across manufacturing, distribution and supply chain operations to maintain operational continuity when facing natural disasters, pandemics, labor shortages, cyber incidents or geopolitical conflicts, and its use of fixed-price contracts, pricing agreements and derivative instruments to hedge commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate volatility. It describes an integrated risk management framework, overseen by the board of directors and executed by cross-functional risk committees, the audit, compliance and ethics departments and a disclosure committee, which identifies, assesses, prioritizes, addresses, monitors and communicates strategic, operational, financial, compliance and reputational risks. The company also emphasizes resource allocation to information technology infrastructure, network security, disaster recovery and phased business transformation initiatives designed to sustain service levels, secure data integrity and mitigate systems disruptions. Through ongoing productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and scenario planning, along with continuous monitoring of evolving legal, regulatory and environmental requirements, the organization seeks to reconfigure product portfolios and packaging, adapt to shifting consumer preferences and regulatory regimes, and preserve performance under pressure. This multifaceted governance and operational approach enables the company to absorb external variations and disturbances, reconstitute trajectories of response toward disruptive events and reconfigure its business toward a sustainable, long-term growth trajectory.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related global events, the Company modified employee work locations and transitioned to a hybrid workplace model, continuing to evaluate and refine its return-to-workplace strategy to maintain operational continuity and organizational health under challenging conditions. The Company has established and continues to commit significant resources to its information technology infrastructure, security protections, disaster recovery planning, and redundancy measures, including reliance on public cloud providers and high-availability capabilities, while recognizing that business interruption or failure of its systems or those of critical third-party service providers could impair product availability, cause customer loss, and damage its reputation. To mitigate vulnerabilities in proprietary and open source software and counter cyberattacks, the Company conducts annual security training, due diligence of partners, internal review and approval processes, and shares threat information with industry and government entities. Its product development and strategic planning processes are designed to incorporate unpredictable regulatory changes, technological advancements such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, and evolving customer requirements, thereby preserving functionality and enabling adaptation, resource reconfiguration, and positive performance maintenance under adversity, even as it acknowledges that these resilience efforts may not fully eliminate operational, regulatory, economic, or security-related risks.

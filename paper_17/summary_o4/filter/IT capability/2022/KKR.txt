While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we can provide no assurance, and we make no representation, that our mitigation efforts will be successful; periods of difficult market or economic conditions or events may occur across one or more industries as well as various sectors or geographies, and, even if general market and economic or other conditions improve broadly, adverse conditions in particular countries, industries, sectors or asset classes may cause our business performance to suffer; these financial markets and economic conditions are outside our control and may affect (i) the value of the investments and other assets held in our funds, in our insurance subsidiaries and on our balance sheet, (ii) opportunities for us (including our insurance companies) and our funds to make, exit and realize value from our investments, (iii) our ability to find suitable investments or secure financing for investments on attractive terms, (iv) our ability to raise capital for new or successor funds on attractive terms, and (v) our capital markets business including the frequency and size of fees generated by it; during periods of difficult market or economic conditions or events, the various companies or assets in which we have investments may experience several negative consequences, including decreased revenues, increased costs, credit rating downgrades, difficulty in obtaining financing and even severe financial losses or insolvency; our and our funds’ portfolio companies may have difficulty expanding their businesses and operations or become unable to pay expenses or other obligations as they become due; adverse conditions may also increase the risk of default with respect to private equity, real assets, credit and other investments that we manage or the bankruptcy, abandonment or foreclosure of our investments; geopolitical developments and other local and global events outside of our control, including, without limitation, trade conflict, sanctions, trade barriers, civil unrest, national and international political circumstances, can, and occasionally do, adversely impact our portfolio companies and our other investments around the world; even where an investment strategy does not directly target a region or country experiencing one of the aforementioned events, we may still be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of such events as a result of indirect exposure we or our portfolio companies may have through supply chains, commodity prices and general macroeconomic exposure; public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as those caused by new strains of viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19), may occur from time to time, which could directly and indirectly adversely impact us and our portfolio companies by threatening our and their employees’ well-being and morale, interrupting business activities, supply chains and transactional activities, disrupting travel and negatively impacting the economies of the affected countries or regions; governments around the world have instituted measures to slow the transmission of COVID-19, which substantially restricted individual and business activities and could be reinstated in the future; these measures could include closures of non-essential businesses, limitations of crowd size, stay-at-home orders, quarantines, heightened border controls, limitations on travel and the conduct of business, and vaccination and testing mandates, which contributed to significant volatility in the financial markets, including volatility in equity prices, supply chain disruptions such as simultaneous supply and demand shocks to global, regional and national economies, and an increase in inflationary pressures; the adverse impact on our business could be significantly driven by a number of factors we are unable to predict or control; we face various security threats on a regular basis, including ongoing cyber-security threats to and attacks on our information technology infrastructure that are intended to gain access to our proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems; breaches in security could jeopardize confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in significant losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to our fund investors and counterparties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage; we rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems and on the systems of third parties who provide services to us, and any disaster, disruption or inability to operate or provide any of these services by us or our vendors could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate our business without interruption; any disruption in the operation of, or inability to access, our New York City office could have a significant impact on our business, a risk heightened during a public health crisis or pandemic.

Within the Risk Factors, the Company acknowledges that its results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on client businesses and levels of business activity, noting that global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence, causing clients to reduce or defer their spending and resulting in revenue volatility. Ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns, including due to increasing geopolitical tensions, inflation, economic downturns and global health emergencies, affect the business by making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting, and require operational flexibility, workforce rebalancing actions—such as reducing new hires and utilizing involuntary terminations—and the attraction, retention and reskilling of the right talent to match client demand around the world. The Company’s ability to generate and maintain client demand depends on adapting and expanding services and solutions in response to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings, including digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings and developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and automation, and on its success in developing innovative pricing and commercial models, strengthening alliances and ecosystem partnerships and managing large, complex engagements that may involve compressed transformational projects, rapid cloud transitions and coordinated subcontractor arrangements. Cybersecurity threats and data privacy incidents could lead to shutdowns or unauthorized disclosures, necessitating robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans—although these plans may not be effective against catastrophic events or simultaneous disruptions across key delivery centers—while evolving legal and regulatory regimes impose heightened compliance obligations and significant penalties for non-compliance, requiring ongoing risk mitigation mechanisms. The Company also identifies risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, requiring currency hedging programs and cost-management strategies, and from tax law changes and audit proceedings, which could materially affect its effective tax rate, cash flows and financial condition, underscoring the importance of continuous assessment of tax positions and global compliance controls. Moreover, as the organization continues to grow its global workforce—exceeding 721,000 employees worldwide—it recognizes the challenge of institutionalizing knowledge, maintaining effective internal controls, instilling core values and managing cultural integration across hierarchical levels, acquisitions and divestitures in order to preserve system integrity, sustain performance under pressure and maintain a competitive advantage.

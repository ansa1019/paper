We continuously assess the evolving situation in Russia and Ukraine, including recent regulatory constraints and international sanctions, and have suspended planned investments and scaled down manufacturing operations in those markets; in Ukraine we temporarily suspended commercial and manufacturing operations, resumed essential retail activities where safety allowed, and began to supply the market from production centers outside the country and through contract manufacturing arrangements. We will continue to monitor this fluid situation and develop contingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to fully mitigate the ongoing or potential impact of COVID-19, natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics, economic, political, regulatory or conflict-related developments. We increasingly rely on third-parties and their subcontractors and suppliers, which, while improving efficiencies and decreasing operating costs, diminish our direct control and may lead to disruption in product distribution, supply chain interruptions, and delays in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory responses related to climate change could influence the quality and volume of agricultural products we rely on and may disrupt operations at factories, warehouses and other premises, while new climate-related requirements may lead to additional compliance costs and penalties even if we align our practices with evolving legal standards. The failure or disruption of our information technology networks and systems, including those managed by third-party service providers, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, cause reputational damage, impact operations, result in data breaches or significant business interruptions, and expose us to litigation, regulatory fines and financial losses; although we continue to invest in administrative, technical and physical safeguards and evaluate preventive actions on an ongoing basis, our controls may not fully mitigate service disruptions or cybersecurity threats. We design our programs to comply with relevant regulations, conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate reduced-risk products and advocate for science-based regulatory frameworks, yet we may be unsuccessful in these efforts and, if regulators do not permit commercialization or communication of substantiated information, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. We face intense competition driven by product quality, R&D, innovation, pricing and consumer willingness to switch to smoke-free products, and our failure to compete effectively or anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences, which may be influenced by economic conditions, regulatory restrictions and availability of accurate information, could materially adversely affect our profitability. Our growth strategy relies on expanding our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and strategic business relationships, which present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated benefits.

The 2022 Form 10-K describes how variability in customer demand may require management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities and how, during periods of rapid growth or decline, the Company faces significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, workforce training, and appropriately sizing its supply chain infrastructure and facilities on a timely basis, with failure to meet these challenges potentially harming gross margins and earnings. It further explains that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected its ability to meet demand due to production, sourcing, logistics, facility closures, workforce challenges and travel restrictions, thereby compelling modifications to business processes, development and qualification of alternative sources of supply, implementation of business continuity plans, social distancing measures in manufacturing, and widespread teleworking. The Company continuously reassesses strategic resource allocation choices in response to changing business conditions to ensure it has the infrastructure and resources to scale appropriately, and where demand fluctuates it may implement cost-management programs to align expenditures with anticipated revenue streams. Even in periods of reduced revenues, it must continue investing in research and development and maintaining extensive global customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm profitability. To mitigate supply chain risks, the Company endeavors to select reputable providers and, where practical, establish alternative sources, recognizing that timely delivery of parts, materials, and services by its suppliers is critical to its product development, manufacturing operations and field support. It manages expense levels based in part on expectations of future revenues and believes that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to sustain investments in R&D and capital infrastructure; anticipated cash flows from operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, are expected to be sufficient to support operating requirements, investments, debt service, capital expenditures and dividends for at least the next twelve months, although continued economic uncertainty and credit market disruptions may affect customer demand and its ability to manage supplier and creditor relationships. Finally, the Company notes that it maintains business continuity plans for its concentrated manufacturing and R&D facilities to address natural or man-made disasters, widespread outbreaks of illness, disruptions of IT resources, utility interruptions, climate change impacts, or political unrest, any of which could delay product development or shipments, impair customer support, and adversely affect business performance.

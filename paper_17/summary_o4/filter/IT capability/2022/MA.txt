Mastercard’s 2022 Form 10-K highlights a range of disclosures reflecting the company’s efforts to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, including extensive risk management and operational resilience measures. The company acknowledges that information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt business continuity, damage its reputation, increase costs and cause losses, while service disruptions—from technology malfunctions, weather events, power outages, telecommunications failures, workplace violence, terrorism, third-party provider failures or inadequate infrastructure in certain markets—could materially affect its ability to process transactions and service customers. To mitigate these internal and external pressures, Mastercard relies on secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information across its global payments network and those of its vendors, and maintains an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, develop effective response strategies and expend significant resources to upgrade controls, processes and practices designed to protect its systems, software, data and networks. The company further notes that evolving cyber-threats, heightened regulatory scrutiny of real-time account-based payment platforms and routine account data breach events involving merchants and processors reinforce the need for ongoing investment in cyber and intelligence solutions, data governance, and fraud monitoring to preserve operational flexibility and system integrity. Mastercard also describes its liquidity and capital resource strategies—retaining cash, cash equivalents and investments, accessing credit facilities and commercial paper programs—to fund operations, manage credit and settlement guarantees, support capital expenditures and strategic investments, and absorb potential concurrent settlement failures or adverse swings in global credit markets. In addition, the firm emphasizes the requirement for organizational adaptation and resource reconfiguration in response to global economic, political and societal disruptions—such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts including the suspension of operations in Russia, climate-related events and shifts in regulatory regimes—that have prompted adjustments to multi-rail solutions, onboarding processes, acquisition integration and compliance approaches, all of which illustrate its capacity to adjust, reconstitute trajectories of response to disruptive events and maintain performance under pressure.

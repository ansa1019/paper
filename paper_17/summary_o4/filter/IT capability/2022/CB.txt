Our report acknowledges that operating through internal or external variations and disturbances—from natural catastrophes and pandemics to cyber-attacks and financial market volatility—requires “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions,” and we seek to manage our loss exposure through a disciplined underwriting process, underwriting controls, risk models, and layered protection including excess-of-loss insurance, per-occurrence limitations, program size caps, geographic diversification and third-party and retrocessional reinsurance, thereby absorbing strain and preserving functioning despite unpredictable events. Actuarial staff in each segment regularly evaluates loss reserves, using a range of statistical and actuarial methods informed by internal knowledge, historical loss development patterns and industry data, and reconfigures assumptions in response to changing legal, inflationary, technological or climate-driven trends. We employ analytical models—including scenario, predictive, stochastic and forecasting techniques—to assist decision-making in underwriting, claims, reserving and catastrophe risk and stress-test probable maximum losses for hurricanes, floods and wildfires, integrating a systemic perspective on evolving perils. We establish global credit limits, collateral arrangements, syndicated multi-currency notional cash pooling and contingency plans covering information security, operational infrastructure and crisis management to maintain operational flexibility, enable resource reallocation and safeguard business continuity when disruptions occur. We manage asset-liability matching by aligning the duration of fixed-income investments with insurance liabilities, regularly review valuation allowances for expected credit losses and uncollectible reinsurance, and apply capital management tools such as share repurchases and dividend programs to sustain organizational health, liquidity and strategic resilience across hierarchical levels and stakeholder groups.

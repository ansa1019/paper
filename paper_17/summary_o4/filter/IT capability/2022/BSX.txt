The annual report acknowledges that “challenging domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations” and that “uncertainty around inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and monetary policy” and related economic turmoil “could worsen, or others could arise,” leading to decreased customer demand, vendor disruptions and supply-chain interruptions that “may lead to a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products or increase the price of such materials or components.” It further warns that “interruption of our supply chain or manufacturing operations, including resulting from natural disasters, further public health crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition” since “we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand,” with “lengthy delays in resuming production” potentially causing loss of market share and reputational harm. The report highlights the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that “our operations, financial performance and cash flows have been, and could in the future continue to be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the risks and challenging macroeconomic conditions caused by the pandemic, including, but not limited to, disruptions in economic activity, global supply chains and labor markets, operational challenges such as site shutdowns, workplace disruptions or limited provider capacity to perform procedures.” In response, the company “monitors the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete, and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects, capital and our people.” The report further describes “global restructuring programs” intended “to simplify our manufacturing and distribution network by transferring certain production lines among facilities and expanding operational efficiencies and resiliency,” with the 2023 plan also “optimizing certain functional capabilities to better support business growth and achieve cost synergies,” preserving headcount through redeployment of resources, and reinvesting savings in strategic growth initiatives. It cautions that “failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results” because such integration “requires significant efforts, including corporate restructuring and the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance,” all of which “result in additional expenses and involve significant management time.” The report emphasizes risk mitigation through “incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans” for cybersecurity and IT/OT systems, recognizing that “if our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans fail, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results,” and it commits to environmental resilience by pursuing “carbon neutrality for scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions in our manufacturing and key distribution sites by 2030,” achieving ISO 50001 and ISO 14001 certifications, deploying on-site solar and LED-certified buildings, and “continuing to improve our energy and environmental performance” to safeguard operations under extreme weather and regulatory change.

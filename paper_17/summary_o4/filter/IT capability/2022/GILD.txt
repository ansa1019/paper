In its Form 10-K the company acknowledges that if it is “unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV products” it “may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development (‘R&D’) efforts.” The report warns that for Veklury, “if we do not accurately forecast demand or manufacture Veklury at levels to align with actual demand, then we may experience product shortages or build excess inventory that may need to be written off.” It notes reliance on third-party apheresis centers, shippers, couriers and contract manufacturers, where “disruptions or difficulties” and the inability to complete timely quality certification “could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.” The firm describes the drug development cycle as “characterized by significant investments of resources, long lead times and unpredictable outcomes due to the nature of developing medicines for human use,” with a “high rate of failure” that can occur late in the process, and observes that “failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment.” The company recognizes that “wholesaler inventory fluctuations” and “purchasing patterns” by non-retail customers may cause “fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand for our products and our revenues.” It discloses exposure to “global supply chain and logistics disruptions and distribution constraints” from pandemic outbreaks and natural disasters, including “power shut-offs and facility shutdowns,” as well as climate-driven events such as earthquakes for which it may not have “sufficient insurance,” potentially requiring significant recovery time to resume operations. The document highlights the risk that failure of collaborative partners to perform in sales, marketing or clinical development could “delay or constrain product development or commercialization of new products,” and cautions that “significant cybersecurity incidents” such as ransomware, data breaches or service interruptions “can result in the loss of critical or sensitive information” and threaten business continuity. Finally, it states that the firm’s success may be hindered by the “failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel,” which could impair its ability to adapt to evolving regulatory, market and technological challenges.

ADP maintains disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events, although these preparations may not fully prevent or mitigate service interruptions, loss of client data or funds, or damage to critical facilities. We devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our information security systems and controls to prevent, detect and respond to data or cybersecurity incidents, and we continue to invest in enhancements to our technology platforms and service solutions—including the roll-out of a new unified user experience, next-gen payroll solutions and self-service digital capabilities—to improve operational flexibility, support continuity of services under challenging conditions such as global recessions, international conflicts or pandemics, and help our clients navigate disruptions. We also implement risk-based anti-money laundering, privacy and data protection compliance programs and binding corporate rules for cross-border transfers, and we employ a diversified client funds investment strategy, supported by committed credit facilities, reverse repurchase agreements and commercial paper, to absorb liquidity pressures, preserve financial resources and maintain the integrity of our performance despite regulatory changes, market volatility or unexpected disruptions. Our comprehensive risk mitigation and resilience framework, encompassing disaster recovery, crisis management, cybersecurity incident response, system resilience and continuous process and product innovation, enhances our ability to adapt to, manage and recover from internal or external variations and disturbances while sustaining client service and preserving organizational health.

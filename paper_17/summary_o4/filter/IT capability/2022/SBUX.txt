The annual report details a wide array of internal and external pressures—from macroeconomic volatility, supply-chain interruptions and commodity price swings to severe weather, climate change effects, health pandemics, geopolitical unrest and labor disruptions—that could materially impair business continuity, operational flexibility and overall firm performance, and accordingly describes the deployment of disaster recovery, incident response and business continuity plans; the adaptation and scaling of supply-chain infrastructure; the introduction of flexible store formats, digital and delivery innovations and strategic pricing; ongoing investments in partner wages, training, technology and cybersecurity systems to anticipate and mitigate risks; continuous monitoring and support of licensees; and the balancing of local autonomy with global consistency in expansion efforts, all of which serve to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions.  The report further emphasizes proactive management of evolving regulatory, environmental, social and governance requirements, including data privacy and climate-related risks, as well as targeted strategic initiatives to adjust rapidly to changing customer behaviors and sustainability goals, and concludes in the management’s discussion and analysis that the Company’s fiscal 2022 results “demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our brand,” reaffirming its confidence in the organization’s ability to maintain positive adjustment, recover from disruptive events and achieve sustainable, profitable growth.

Across its risk disclosures, Nike emphasizes that it continuously monitors evolving threats such as pandemics, climate change–driven extreme weather and geopolitical tensions and incorporates a range of forecasting assumptions into its operating, financial and tax planning while acknowledging the inherent unpredictability of future developments. It maintains business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, supported by a geographically diversified supply chain and robust information technology systems, though noting these measures may not suffice under concurrent or exceptional events. A centralized foreign-exchange risk management program leverages natural offsets and derivative hedges to mitigate currency volatility in product costs, revenues and cash flows. Supply chain resilience is pursued through a futures ordering program, advanced wholesale credit assessments and a seasonless inventory approach, complemented by strategic pricing and promotional levers to address delays and demand shifts. Nike’s digital transformation and investments in digital platforms aim to bolster operational flexibility and direct-to-consumer engagement. The company also addresses cyber-attack and system-failure risks by investing in security and business continuity planning across its IT infrastructure. Distribution resilience is underpinned by contingency planning for natural disasters or other disruptions to its global distribution centers and third-party logistics providers. Contract manufacturer relationships are diversified and periodically reassessed to ensure capacity and quality, while alternative suppliers and multi-modal transport options are identified to mitigate production interruptions. Nike further safeguards financial resilience through committed credit facilities, conservative counterparty exposure and scenario planning for credit, market and regulatory uncertainties, thereby strengthening its capacity to maintain performance under adverse conditions.

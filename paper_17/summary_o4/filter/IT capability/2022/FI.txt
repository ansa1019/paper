The 10-K underscores Fiserv’s efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions through its comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans, noting that operational failures from hardware and software defects, cyberattacks, human error, natural disasters, pandemics or other events may prevent it from “successfully or quickly recover[ing] all of our critical business functions, assets and data” through its business continuity program. The company recognizes that “any unauthorized access, intrusion, infiltration, network disruption, ransom, denial of service or similar incident” could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of its systems and data, and invests significant resources to maintain and enhance its information security controls and remediate vulnerabilities. Fiserv’s markets are characterized by constant and rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent introduction of new products and services and increasing client expectations, and it notes that its ability to respond timely to these changes “by enhancing our current products and services and developing and introducing new products and services” will significantly affect its success. The firm acknowledges risks arising from reliance on third-party service providers, participants in the global financial system and supply chains, where inadequate or delayed performance could expose it and its clients to information security, financial, compliance and reputational risks and limit its ability to provide services. It also identifies regulatory, economic and geopolitical pressures—including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, trade restrictions, inflation and global conflicts—that may amplify other risk factors and adversely impact its operations, liquidity and financial condition. Through its alliance structure, multi-channel partnerships, contractual renewal strategies and disciplined capital allocation, alongside policies and training programs for cybersecurity, data privacy, anti-money laundering and antitrust compliance, Fiserv strives to allocate resources, manage external pressures and preserve functionality and performance under adversity, thereby strengthening its organizational resilience.

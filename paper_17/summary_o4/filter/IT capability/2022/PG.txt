P&G’s annual report describes numerous capabilities and processes that support organizational resilience by enabling the company to maintain performance and adapt under adverse conditions.  The company emphasizes its ability to manage demand, supply and operational challenges during disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics by maintaining elevated safety stock levels, collaborating with suppliers via a supply chain finance program and implementing employee-safety measures to minimize workforce disruptions.  It highlights strategies to sustain business continuity and respond effectively to major external perturbations—such as political volatility, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, extreme weather events, transportation and labor constraints and supply chain interruptions—through supply chain optimizations, sole-supplier and sole-manufacturing plant arrangements, diversified sourcing and extended payment-term agreements with suppliers.  P&G details its crisis response mechanisms for the Russia-Ukraine war, including the suspension of new investments, promotional activities and portfolio adjustments in affected regions, and acknowledges potential impairments or asset write-downs if facilities become inoperable.  The report also outlines its risk mitigation framework for cyber-attacks and IT/OT system failures, underpinned by business continuity plans for data security, process redundancies and recovery protocols, and ongoing investments in cybersecurity defenses.  To counter macroeconomic and financial volatility—including foreign currency fluctuations, trade policy changes, commodity price swings and credit-market disruptions—the company leverages strong liquidity, global credit facilities, market access for debt issuance and dynamic pricing and trade spending adjustments.  P&G underscores its continuous productivity improvement programs, organizational change initiatives and strategic use of acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures to reconfigure resources, capture innovations in products and packaging, broaden digital capabilities and reinforce operational flexibility.  These combined measures reflect a systemic perspective on resilience, whereby P&G absorbs strain, preserves functioning and seeks to emerge stronger from disruptions by deploying adaptive strategies, resource allocations and collaborative networks.

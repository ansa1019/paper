Applied Materials’ disclosures describe the company’s ongoing efforts to maintain business continuity and preserve positive performance under volatile, cyclical, and disruptive conditions by accurately forecasting demand and effectively managing resources and production capacity, including dynamically scaling manufacturing capacity and inventory levels, controlling costs, and aligning cost structures during both rising and falling demand periods. The company emphasizes supply chain resilience by diversifying sources, transferring business to alternative suppliers when necessary, and mitigating transportation, logistics and material shortages caused by factors such as accelerated digital transformation, pandemics, natural disasters, trade restrictions, geopolitical turmoil and regulatory changes. To sustain operational flexibility and competitive advantage, Applied invests continuously in research, development and engineering, maintains and improves global business infrastructure, and implements enterprise resource planning and information system enhancements to support quality, productivity and agility. It also ensures liquidity and financial resilience through cash reserves, investment portfolios, credit facilities and senior notes, and deploys risk management processes—covering credit evaluations, inventory valuation, warranty reserves and insurance—to absorb internal and external pressures, facilitate rapid reconfiguration of operations, and respond to evolving customer requirements, all of which together support the organization’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to unexpected situations, and emerge stronger from adversity.

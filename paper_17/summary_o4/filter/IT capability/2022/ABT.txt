Abbott’s operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain. In response to pandemic-related disruptions, Abbott has taken actions to offset inflationary pressures and preserve operational continuity, including selective price increases, margin improvement initiatives and prioritization of critical production capacity, enabling to date the management of various supply chain challenges without significant service or material shortages. To mitigate cyber and technology risks, Abbott invests in its information technology systems and data protection measures, monitors for current and potential threats and vulnerabilities, and adapts to regulatory changes to maintain system integrity and performance. Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch new COVID-19 diagnostic tests and, during the voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage at its Sturgis facility, reconstituted manufacturing trajectories by converting alternative lines, redirecting imports from international sites and entering into a consent decree to resume production, thereby demonstrating resource reconfiguration and organizational agility. The company commits substantial resources to research and development initiatives, invests in strategic acquisitions and alliances and enters hedging arrangements to mitigate foreign currency exposure, while executing restructuring plans to reduce costs and improve efficiencies and maintaining robust liquidity through cash on hand, an undrawn revolving credit facility and investment grade debt ratings to ensure financial flexibility for ongoing strategic initiatives. Through these measures—spanning risk management, resource allocation, operational flexibility and strategic adaptation—Abbott demonstrates its capacity to absorb strain, preserve and partially improve functioning under adversity, consistent with a systemic perspective on organizational resilience.

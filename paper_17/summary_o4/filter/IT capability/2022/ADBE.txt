The Company’s disclosures recognize that maintaining business continuity and preserving or improving functioning under internal or external pressures—whether competitive, technological, environmental or geopolitical—is critical to its operational resilience. In particular, the Company may suffer materially if it cannot adapt its products and services to emerging platforms, evolving customer requirements and disruptive technologies, and if it fails to integrate or reconfigure its acquisitions effectively; it faces risks that include supply chain disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, lack of full redundancy in its data centers, unexpected interruptions in data migrations or third-party hosting services, hardware or software failures, spikes in demand that exceed infrastructure capacity, and cyber-security breaches—all of which may impair its ability to deliver committed service levels and protect information and intellectual property. Its disaster recovery planning, capacity-planning processes and emergency management mechanisms seek to absorb strain and support positive adjustment under challenging conditions, but may not address every eventuality. The Company devotes significant resources to risk mitigation and operational flexibility—via security engineering, system audits against frameworks such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2, incident response enhancements, capacity expansion, and continuous monitoring—to safeguard system integrity, preserve performance under pressure and promote rapid recovery. It also acknowledges that climate-related events such as wildfires, drought-related power outages and pandemics, as well as changes in laws, regulations and market volatility, require ongoing recalibration of resource allocation, organizational practices, inter-organizational collaboration and strategic initiatives to sustain innovation, protect organizational health and ensure the maintenance of positive adjustment amid extreme or exceptional disturbances.

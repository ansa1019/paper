We emphasize our ability to anticipate, confront and adapt to economic, geopolitical and environmental disturbances by adjusting pricing, optimizing channel and package mix, pursuing productivity initiatives and deploying digitalization and sustainability programs in order to preserve operational continuity and mitigate cost inflation.  We actively monitor adverse economic conditions, volatile commodity markets and supply‐chain disruptions—including shortages of key ingredients, energy and materials—and maintain contingency plans, flexible supplier arrangements and working capital efficiency measures (such as extended payment terms and supply-chain financing) to absorb strain and preserve performance.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reconfigured our manufacturing and distribution networks, shifted channel mixes toward at-home consumption and e-commerce, and reinforced information-system and cybersecurity controls to sustain business operations under challenging conditions.  Ongoing investments in marketing, innovation, workforce development and strategic capabilities are designed to strengthen organizational culture, attract and retain diverse talent, and support resilience strategies across our global system.  Our sustainability focus—addressing water stewardship, packaging recoverability, renewable energy usage, carbon footprint reduction and responsible sourcing—serves to manage environmental risks and regulatory fluctuations and to safeguard our capacity to function and grow under resource constraints.  Financial resilience is maintained through robust cash-flow generation, prudent debt financing, disciplined capital allocation, dividend growth and share repurchases to ensure liquidity, access to capital markets and strategic flexibility.  Finally, our quality management programs, risk-assessment processes and third-party oversight enhance our ability to detect and respond to emerging threats, preserve organizational integrity and reconstitute trajectories toward strengthened performance even in the face of unexpected disruptions.

Our operational and security systems infrastructure, including our computer systems, emerging technologies, data management and internal processes and controls, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance, and prolonged disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services are possible due to computer, telecommunications, network, utility, electronic or physical infrastructure outages, including from technology failures, cyber-events, significant unplanned transaction volumes, system vulnerabilities, supply-chain disruptions, natural disasters and civil unrest. Effective management of our business continuity increasingly depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of such systems, and any backup systems may not process data as quickly as our primary systems or have all data backed up, while our and our third partiesâ€™ inability to properly introduce, deploy and manage changes to internal financial and governance processes, existing products, services and technology, and new product innovations and technology could result in additional operational and regulatory risk. Despite measures we have taken to implement training, procedures, backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience, significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact could still adversely affect our ability to conduct business. To prepare for potential adverse events, our board approves a liquidity risk policy and a financial contingency and recovery plan designed to ensure we maintain global liquidity sources, meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs under expected and stressed conditions, diversify funding sources, conduct regular stress testing, and maintain committed lines of credit and related intercompany arrangements in support of our preferred single-point-of-entry resolution strategy. Cybersecurity resilience is addressed through a multi-layered, intelligence-led global information security program focused on preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to and recovering from cyber threats and incidents, integrated with business continuity protocols, while strategic and capital planning incorporate scenario and stress analyses of interest rate, liquidity, market and credit risks under multiple macroeconomic scenarios to maintain preparedness and adaptability in the face of internal or external variations and disturbances.

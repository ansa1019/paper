Bristol-Myers Squibb maintains a comprehensive set of organizational resilience measures, including reliance on supplier, vendor and alliance partner business continuity plans in the event of a crisis; the establishment of a company-wide policy and governance process to monitor and limit direct customer sales in compliance with regulatory consent; investment in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices of data and IT systems with ongoing threat detection; and the use of a commercial paper program and regular evaluation of capital structure, working capital needs, debt and leverage ratios, debt maturities, capital expenditures and strategic investments to ensure adequate liquidity access, efficient financing of operations and flexibility for future transactions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted procedures to ensure the continued supply of medicines and to protect the health, wellbeing and safety of our workforce, while remaining unable to predict the full extent of the pandemicâ€™s impact on our operations. The evolution of our operating model, emphasizing a disciplined approach to marketing, selling and administrative expenses, is intended to provide the strategic, financial and operational flexibility required to invest in high-priority portfolio opportunities. Through Celgene acquisition restructuring activities, we realized at least $3.0 billion of annual synergies from cost savings and avoidance. We continue to evaluate and adapt to legislative and regulatory changes, such as those under the Inflation Reduction Act, assess potential supply chain interruptions arising from natural disasters, pandemics, travel restrictions and market forces, and refine forecasting methodologies where third-party demand information is limited, all in order to preserve organizational health, resource deployment and performance maintenance under challenging conditions.

Our risk management and operational resilience practices include a broad compliance framework “designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, such as anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, competition, money transfer services, privacy and sanctions, and we continually adjust our compliance programs as regulations evolve,” recognizing that “if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services, fees and other important aspects of our business to comply with the regulations.” In order to mitigate settlement and liquidity risk, we “maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures,” may require clients to post collateral if credit standards are not met, and hold dedicated funds in a U.S. litigation escrow account “restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the U.S. covered litigation,” from which we do not draw for other operational needs. To ensure business continuity and operational flexibility, we “regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures,” maintain a commercial paper program and a $5.0 billion revolving credit facility, and adhere to treasury policies that “provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives,” thereby preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Our cybersecurity and processing systems and those of our counterparties have “experienced and may continue to experience errors, interruptions, delays or damage” from a variety of internal and external disruptions, and although “we have security measures and procedures in place to protect our systems and data, and prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats,” we maintain a business continuity program to recover critical functions, assets and data. We also systematically assess tax, legal and compliance contingencies by exercising “significant judgment and make estimates in calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities” and by evaluating “probable additional indirect taxes” or unsettled litigation matters, recognizing that “a taxing authority’s challenge to our positions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.” Finally, we continue to invest in technology assets and processing infrastructure, adjust our operating rules and governance in response to evolving central-bank oversight and licensing requirements, and engage with third parties—including financial institutions, merchants, fintechs and regulators—to detect, adapt and recover from adverse legal, regulatory, market and operational disruptions.

Micron’s 2022 Form 10-K describes a range of organizational practices and strategic initiatives that support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, noting that “we have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs, which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid technological changes,” and that “we strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels.” To mitigate such imbalances, “in the first quarter of 2023, we are selectively reducing facility utilization in both DRAM and NAND” and deploying contingency measures for disruptions to manufacturing from operational issues, natural disasters, public health measures, or geopolitical events, which “could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.” The company emphasizes supply chain resilience by maintaining “multiple sources of supply for our materials and services,” while acknowledging single-source dependencies and long-term contracts that may lack firm capacity or pricing commitments. It further details continuous investments in R&D and capital expenditures—“we estimate capital expenditures in 2023 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, to be around $8 billion”—and the geographic dispersion of manufacturing facilities to improve yields and reduce risk. Liquidity management measures, including maintaining cash and marketable investments, access to a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, and a board-authorized $10 billion share repurchase program “subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash,” together with the leveraging of government incentives for capacity expansions, collectively serve to preserve operational flexibility and support the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.

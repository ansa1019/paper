The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize its efforts to preserve performance and integrity under challenging conditions by investing in operational continuity and resilience across its supply chain, information technology, logistics and facilities. It acknowledges that disruptions in merchandise distribution, processing, packaging and manufacturing—whether due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other catastrophic events—may “adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members” and that failures in IT systems could “have an adverse impact on our ability to buy products and services from our suppliers, produce goods in our manufacturing plants, move the products in an efficient manner to our warehouses and sell products to our members.” Recognizing the critical role of IT, the Company is “undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects” and “currently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency,” noting that “given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes.” It further warns that “any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations including loss of business services, increased cost of moving merchandise and failure to provide service to our members.” The Company also highlights its reliance on third-party logistics and payment processors, the potential for supply chain constraints if suppliers cannot meet quality or timing requirements, and the need for self-insurance and reinsurance programs to limit exposures from large losses. It identifies natural disasters, extreme weather, climate change, and the “highly unpredictable and volatile” COVID-19 pandemic as events that could disrupt transportation, store operations, workforce availability and consumer demand, thereby intensifying other risks related to labor, inventory, consumer behavior, and financial market volatility. These disclosures reflect a systemic perspective on risk mitigation, resource allocation and contingency planning designed to support business continuity, adaptability and the maintenance of core operations under internal and external pressures.

The company recognizes that its business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may impair business continuity and require adaptive responses to maintain performance under internal or external variations and disturbances. Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on leveraging the momentum of our strategic investments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capabilities, and the coordinated operation of our network of physical stores, distribution facilities, and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our interconnected strategy. Executing our interconnected retail strategy requires continual investment in our operations and information technology systems, as well as the development and execution of new processes, systems and support, and building out our supply chain involves significant real estate projects to support different types of facilities; failure to choose or manage these investments effectively could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Disruption within our logistics or supply chain network, such as the industry-wide challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect our ability to receive and deliver inventory timely, impair our ability to meet customer demand, and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, and damage to our reputation, and our inventory turnover ratio was materially affected by strategic investments to promote higher in-stock levels and pull forward merchandise in response to ongoing global supply chain disruption. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business, and although we implement maintenance, updates, security processes, and substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel, delays, outages, cyber-attacks, or failures during migration of legacy systems can impair our customer-facing technology systems and interconnected retail strategy. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and support strategic initiatives while managing labor costs, wage pressures, health and safety concerns, and remote or hybrid work challenges, as well as sourcing skilled professionals to implement technology and operational investments. We must also effectively manage alliances and relationships with suppliers, integrate strategic transactions to enhance capabilities, and maintain product quality, regulatory compliance, and responsible sourcing to differentiate ourselves and preserve operational flexibility. We address legal, regulatory, economic, climate, and geopolitical risks—including the unpredictable, volatile, and uncertain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on workforce, supply chain and customer behavior—by implementing safety measures, benefits, policy adjustments, and contingency planning. Maintaining organizational resilience further requires disciplined capital allocation, prioritizing investments in the business, supported by cash flow from operations, a $5.0 billion commercial paper program, back-up credit facilities, senior notes issuances, and stringent liquidity management to ensure continued funding of capital expenditures, dividends, and share repurchases under varying market conditions.

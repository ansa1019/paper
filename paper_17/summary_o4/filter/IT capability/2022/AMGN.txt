Amgen’s filings describe the maintenance of operational continuity under both nominal and exceptional conditions by relying on sophisticated information technology systems—some managed by third parties—that require continuous monitoring, protection and resilience to guard against internal or external events, including cyberattacks, system breakdowns, service interruptions and data breaches, which could interrupt business operations, impose significant costs and harm the company’s reputation. The company highlights its business continuity plans and periodic disaster‐risk assessments for its critical manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks—facilities that have withstood hurricanes, earthquakes, utility failures and labor disputes yet remain capable of operating on backup power—underscoring its capacity to reallocate resources and adapt production when confronted with natural disasters, pandemic‐related shutdown orders or geopolitical disruptions that threaten its supply chains, clinical trials and product distribution. It also describes rapid reallocation of manufacturing capacity under the U.S. Defense Production Act in response to COVID-19, adjustments to remote working arrangements to preserve workforce health and productivity, and the use of financial hedges—cross‐currency and interest rate swaps—to manage volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates, thereby demonstrating systemic flexibility in resource deployment. Amgen further emphasizes diversification of suppliers and contract manufacturers, engagement in inter‐organizational collaboration to secure raw materials and device components, and investments in environmental, social and governance initiatives and legal compliance programs designed to strengthen organizational health, preserve performance under pressure and mitigate risks from evolving regulatory, tax and reimbursement landscapes, all reflecting an integrated approach to sustaining integrity, preserving performance and emerging stronger from disruptive events.

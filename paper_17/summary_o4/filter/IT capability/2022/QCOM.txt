The annual report discloses that the Company’s business continuity and capacity to maintain performance under internal or external disturbances depends on significant ongoing investments of management time, attention and resources to adapt organizational structures, processes and supply strategies in the face of concentration of customer and supplier power, geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, capacity constraints, natural disasters, health crises, cyber-attacks and macroeconomic downturns. It describes extensive risk mitigation measures, including multi-year capacity commitments, diversification of product and geographic end markets, alternate supplier qualification, inventory management at the lower of cost or net realizable value, robust cybersecurity protocols aligned to international frameworks, and capital allocation to research, development and strategic transactions such as acquisitions and joint ventures—all of which embody operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and reconstituting of temporal response trajectories toward emerging conditions. The report further explains the complexity and challenge of integrating acquisitions, retaining critical human capital, transforming business models to enter new industries such as automotive and IoT, and managing legal, regulatory and intellectual property contingencies, each requiring organizational learning, cross-functional collaboration and dynamic capabilities to absorb strain, preserve integrity and reconfigure for recovery and future growth. Finally, it recognizes that adverse resolutions of litigation, evolving standards for patent licensing, environmental compliance obligations, inflationary and tax law changes, and fluctuating demand cycles in the cyclical semiconductor industry all pose external pressures that necessitate continuous risk assessment, adaptation strategies and resilience engineering to maintain performance and system integrity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

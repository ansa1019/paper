Merck & Co. describes a range of organizational practices and capabilities aimed at preserving business continuity and maintaining performance under internal or external pressures, including active monitoring and mitigation of supply-chain and geopolitical disruptions, such as the war in Ukraine and COVID-19-related interruptions, through cross-functional teams that work globally to safeguard the uninterrupted supply of essential medicines while complying with sanctions and donating profits from high-risk markets. The company’s ongoing restructuring program, focused on optimizing its manufacturing and supply network and reducing real estate footprints, reflects its commitment to resource reallocation, cost-containment and operational flexibility, with projected annual net cost savings of approximately $900 million by the end of 2023. In response to climate change risks—both acute (extreme weather events, physical damage to facilities, inventory spoilage, business interruption) and chronic (transition-related legal or regulatory requirements, carbon pricing, increased compliance costs)—Merck evaluates potential impacts on operations, supply chains and product development, invests in facility upgrades, data gathering and reporting systems, and anticipates how transitional risks may be passed along by suppliers. To counter currency and interest-rate volatility, the company employs hedging agreements, including forward contracts, collars and interest-rate swaps, as well as foreign-currency-denominated debt designated as net-investment hedges, thereby managing cash-flow variability and protecting system integrity. Recognizing the critical importance of information resilience, Merck continues to strengthen cyber-attack defenses and monitor its IT ecosystems, acknowledging that disruptions to manufacturing, research or sales operations could result in loss of sensitive data or operational capacity. The firm’s risk management framework further encompasses rigorous assessment of product liability, compliance with evolving environmental, social and governance expectations, extensive contingency accruals for legal and environmental liabilities, and proactive portfolio management—including the scaling of research-and-development investments, collaborations and acquisitions—to ensure the organization can absorb strain, adapt to regulatory, competitive and market perturbations, and sustain performance even amid unforeseen or extreme conditions.

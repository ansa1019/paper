In its risk disclosures the company describes a comprehensive framework to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, acknowledging internal and external variations and disturbances ranging from high inflation, interest-rate volatility, and disrupted supply chains reliant on sole-source suppliers to public health crises such as COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts, and climate-induced natural disasters. It details mitigation measures including enhanced supplier communication, revised purchase order coverage, inventory optimization, alternative capital acquisition models and usage-based arrangements to preserve or improve functioning, and flexible payment deferments and service credits in response to customer financial pressures. The report also addresses its operational flexibility through diversified manufacturing locations, continuity planning for information technology systems—featuring cybersecurity programs and remote-work safeguards—and investments in simulation, telepresence, and training programs to sustain knowledge transfer and corporate culture. Recognizing staffing shortages, legal and regulatory enforcement risks, and the absence of multiple-site capacity for certain operations, the company emphasizes ongoing operational resilience initiatives, such as risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, and strategic adaptation, aimed at preserving system integrity and performance, facilitating recovery from disruptions, and reconstituting future trajectories in dynamic and exceptional conditions.

Our annual report makes clear that our organization is exposed to a wide range of internal and external pressures—from supply chain disruptions and potential failures of third-party manufacturers to evolving regulatory requirements, cybersecurity threats and global health emergencies—any of which, if realized, could materially impair our business, financial condition or operating results. To preserve operational continuity and maintain performance under such adverse conditions, we have invested in internal manufacturing capabilities, maintained a diversified global network of third-party contractors, adopted a comprehensive business continuity plan, secured insurance policies for extraordinary events and developed contingency arrangements for critical resources. We actively monitor developments such as the COVID-19 pandemic on a site-specific basis, adjust clinical trial enrollment and dosing protocols as circumstances require, and stand prepared to pause or delay trial activities to protect participants and program integrity. Our corporate compliance program, together with robust risk management and contingency processes covering data privacy, regulatory oversight, government pricing programs, environmental safety and legal obligations, is designed to detect, prevent and mitigate emerging risks. We routinely deploy financial hedging, maintain credit facilities and engage in tax and reimbursement planning to absorb strain from market volatility, healthcare law changes, reimbursement challenges, foreign exchange fluctuations and competitive talent markets. By leveraging strategic collaborations, dynamically reallocating resources, and continually enhancing our global processes and infrastructure, we strive to maintain partial integrity of our operations and stakeholder commitments, adapt to unexpected events, and preserve the company’s ability to recover, transform and flourish even under nominal, extreme or exceptional circumstances.

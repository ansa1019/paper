The company’s risk factor disclosures describe measures and strategies intended to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external disturbances, recognizing that its “system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate” and that “following an interruption to its business, the company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.” The company acknowledges that its largely outsourced, global supply chain—often with single or limited sources—exposes it to component shortages, pricing fluctuations, and geopolitical, public health, and climate-driven disruptions that can impede manufacturing and delivery and create delays and inefficiencies in its service offerings. To mitigate such risks and maintain operational flexibility, it commits to monitoring macroeconomic and regulatory developments, adapting operations “in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities,” investing in business continuity and disaster recovery planning, deploying information-security systems, multifactor authentication and insurance coverage, and maintaining liquidity through cash, cash equivalents, unrestricted marketable securities and debt market access. The company further recognizes that changing laws, regulations and legal proceedings impose “onerous and expensive” compliance obligations that may require organizational agility, policy updates and resource reconfiguration, while its management’s discussion asserts that available financial resources are “sufficient” to satisfy cash requirements and support strategic initiatives, reflecting an orientation toward maintaining integrity, performance and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The Company maintains crisis management and disaster response plans to preserve operational continuity in the face of natural disasters, climate-driven events, pandemics, terrorism, cyberattacks or other internal and external perturbations that could disrupt service delivery or harm customer businesses and incur substantial expense. It invests in data center capacity, interconnectivity, public cloud services and hybrid infrastructure, along with extensive security measures and a data governance framework, and enters into foreign currency derivative contracts to mitigate risks stemming from environmental disruptions, cybersecurity threats, regulatory changes and exchange-rate volatility, thereby absorbing strain while preserving system integrity and performance. The Now Platform’s digital transformation capabilities integrate siloed technology, customer, industry, employee and creator workflows to enable clients to maintain, adapt and enhance business continuity, compliance and resilience under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. The Company allocates financial and human resources to expand global cloud-hosted solutions, regional service-delivery models and compliance certifications, reconfiguring its operational footprint to address evolving data residency, privacy and regulatory demands. Its subscription model, supported by a 98% renewal rate, and robust free cash flow provide predictable resource deployment and liquidity to sustain critical operations, fund strategic R&D, acquisitions, partner ecosystems and professional services, and absorb unforeseeable disruptions—thereby reinforcing organizational strength, agility and the capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

Our business continuity and operational flexibility are tested by numerous internal and external pressures—including the COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain disruptions, economic uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets, competition, geopolitical conflicts, regulatory changes and climate-related events—to which “we may not be able to effectively respond” and which require that “we adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors.” In response, “we continue to execute our customer first, people led, innovation driven strategy,” combining “our network with digital capabilities to drive new services,” optimizing our network, executing productivity initiatives, and enhancing revenue quality actions and fuel surcharge strategies to preserve performance. We “monitor and manage foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures, and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes,” and “mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our pricing strategy and may utilize hedging transactions,” thereby absorbing strain and maintaining system integrity under market perturbations. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery plans to guard against hazards such as cyber-attacks and system disruptions, while our disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation—“regularly evaluat[ing] opportunities to optimize our capital structure,” ensuring access to commercial paper programs, capital markets and other liquidity options, and deploying cash from operations—supports short- and long-term funding requirements. We adjust human capital strategies to attract, engage, develop and retain a large and diverse global workforce, balancing labor costs, benefits and training to sustain organizational effectiveness. Through transformation initiatives, strategic foresight and dynamic capabilities—including network and capacity expansion, facility automation, technology investments and selective acquisitions such as Delivery Solutions and Bomi Group—we have strengthened our balance sheet, retired $2.0 billion of debt, generated strong cash flows and provided dividends, share repurchases and pension contributions. We also “assess the carrying values of our assets” and adapt our aircraft and vehicle fleet plans based on projected volume and market conditions, while pricing initiatives, volume-sensitive product mix adjustments and fuel surcharges reflect ongoing resource deployment and risk mitigation in a volatile environment. This multifaceted approach underpins our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, maintain integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances, and emerge stronger from disruptive change.

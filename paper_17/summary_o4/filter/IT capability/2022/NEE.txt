NEE and FPL maintain extensive regulatory assets and liabilities representing probable future revenues recoverable or refundable through ratemaking, and adjust accrued asset removal costs and reserve amortization under both the 2021 and 2016 rate agreements to achieve their targeted regulatory returns; following hurricanes Ian and Nicole, FPL incurred $1.3 billion of storm restoration costs and filed with the FPSC to replenish storm reserves and restore operational continuity, while the deployment of additional winterizing measures, modified plant operations and expanded load-shedding options exemplifies the organization’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functionality; to manage the financial distress of outages, equipment failures, compliance investigations and cyber incidents, NEE has secured billions of dollars of insurance coverage, letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantee arrangements on behalf of its subsidiaries—supporting power purchase agreements, nuclear decommissioning, fuel procurement and trading activities—and maintains master netting agreements and margin collateral requirements to mitigate credit risk; the $12.5 billion of net available liquidity from syndicated and bilateral revolving credit facilities provides a systemic contingency resource for unexpected demands; through diversification of FPL’s regulated utility business and NEER’s renewable energy, transmission and gas infrastructure operations, along with the use of derivative instruments (swaps, options, futures and forwards) and value-at-risk monitoring, NEE manages commodity price, interest rate and counterparty exposures, reflects dynamic capabilities in risk assessment and resource reconfiguration, and maintains investment-grade credit ratings to secure cost-effective capital; defined benefit pension strategies with fully funded trusts, actuarial assumptions for discount rates and expected returns, and market-related valuations of plan assets ensure funding adequacy for employee benefits; long-lived asset recoverability tests and accruals for asset retirement obligations based on FPSC-approved decommissioning studies and inflation escalations safeguard system integrity under prolonged internal and external perturbations; and the ongoing program to purchase limited partner interests in NEP, issuances of differential membership interests, and debt financings support capital requirements for development and enable adaptive strategies to maintain performance under turbulent market and regulatory environments.

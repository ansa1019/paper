In our disclosures, we note that our systems and those of our third-party providers are exposed to cybersecurity risks that could cause material interruptions or malfunctions, misappropriation, destruction or unavailability of data, requiring us to devote time and resources to ongoing remediation, and that such measures to avoid or mitigate incidents may be insufficient or become obsolete as threats rapidly evolve. Although we have disaster recovery plans with backup facilities, we acknowledge that our systems are not always fully redundant, our disaster planning may not be sufficient or effective, and disruptions to physical or technological infrastructure—whether from natural disasters, pandemics, cyber attacks, sabotage or political unrest—could materially interrupt our operations, harm our reputation, result in litigation or regulatory actions and impair our ability to serve customers. We maintain policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability and security of our information technology environment and to support business continuity, yet we cannot predict all adverse effects of unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access, nor guarantee the effectiveness of our infrastructure investments and cloud-based transitions. We recognize that implementing new processes and technologies, migrating to cloud infrastructure and integrating acquired businesses involve significant resource allocation, change-management efforts and heightened cybersecurity risk, which may divert management attention, incur unexpected costs and challenge our operational flexibility. We regularly assess and enhance our business continuity plans and key-management succession, but a significant-scale disaster or prolonged interruption could cause material financial loss, loss of personnel, regulatory sanctions and reputational harm. Furthermore, in dynamic capital, commodity, automotive and engineering markets marked by economic volatility, regulatory changes, pandemics and geopolitical conflicts, we must continue investing in innovation, process improvements and collaborative practices to maintain performance and adapt to evolving customer needs and external pressures. Finally, our indebtedness, debt covenants and acquisition commitments may constrain resource redeployment and limit our ability to absorb strain and pursue strategic initiatives, posing additional challenges to preserving integrity and performance under adverse conditions.

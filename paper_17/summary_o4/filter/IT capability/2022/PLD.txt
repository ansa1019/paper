Prologis’ disclosures highlight various elements that support organizational resilience, including managing “difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain geographies, including differing employment practices and labor issues” and “challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies and to monitor compliance with applicable regulations.” The company mitigates external disturbances such as “disruptions in the global capital and credit markets” through strategic hedging by “borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments thereby providing a natural hedge” and entering into derivative financial instruments. It recognizes that “real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets,” which may limit its ability to “react promptly to changes,” and therefore plans alternative liquidity measures, including “divesting properties at less than optimal terms,” incurring debt, or adjusting lease agreements. Prologis’ development and redevelopment strategies are “focused on monetizing land and redevelopment sites in the future,” enabling adaptation to evolving customer logistics needs, and it engages in co-investment ventures to access additional capital and expertise. The firm maintains extensive insurance programs—property damage, rental loss, environmental, hurricane and flood, even earthquake coverage where “commercially reasonable”—and evaluates coverage annually, self-insuring when prudent, to ensure recovery and continuity under hazards and extreme conditions. It addresses operational continuity by implementing system redundancies, security measures and disaster recovery plans to counter system failures or cybersecurity attacks, and by enforcing rigorous disclosure controls to prevent errors and maintain organizational coherence. In response to global pandemics, Prologis adapts its workforce, manages supply chain disruptions, and considers government, labor and travel restrictions in its crisis management framework. The company’s strategic agility extends to climate-related transitions, as it monitors physical risks from severe weather and evolving regulations to sustain performance under environmental perturbations. Through these mechanisms—operational flexibility, risk mitigation, resource reallocation, and adaptive strategies—Prologis preserves its integrity and “performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances,” consistent with scholarly definitions of organizational resilience.

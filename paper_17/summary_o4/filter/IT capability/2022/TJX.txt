Throughout our risk disclosures and management’s discussion, we describe numerous organizational processes and capabilities that align with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning. These include our opportunistic buying strategy with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns, merchant discretion to react to rapidly changing market trends, the ability to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise, maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory, and flexibly allocate store floor space based on sales forecasts. We highlight how our business continuity has been tested by COVID-19-related store closures, inflationary pressures and supply-chain disruptions, prompting operational adjustments such as enhanced cleaning protocols, occupancy limitations, additional health and safety measures, and the implementation of disaster recovery plans for critical IT systems. We discuss dynamic financial management practices—monitoring liquidity, hedging foreign currency and commodity exposures, repaying debt, deploying capital expenditures for distribution centers and information systems, and managing stock repurchases and dividends—to sustain liquidity and support growth. Key to our resilience are organizational capabilities in recruiting, developing and retaining a large, disparate workforce, including remote working arrangements and succession planning, as well as governance structures to comply with evolving regulatory and ESG requirements. Further, we emphasize the ongoing improvements to information security, cyber-attack mitigation strategies and supply-chain risk management protocols to maintain system integrity, support rapid response to environmental perturbations and ensure continuity of operations under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

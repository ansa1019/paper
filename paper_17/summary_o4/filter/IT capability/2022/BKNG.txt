Booking Holdings’ Form 10-K repeatedly addresses its capacity to maintain continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions—ranging from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather, natural disasters, terrorism, geopolitical hostilities, and macroeconomic and currency volatility to rapid technological and market changes, intense competition, evolving customer payment preferences, cybersecurity threats, and shifting regulatory and tax regimes—by investing in performance and brand marketing, adaptive technology (including mobile platforms, cloud computing, AI, and its “connected trip” strategy), redundant IT infrastructure, disaster‐recovery and cyber-risk controls, diversified distribution channels, merchant payment processing, partner insurance offerings, and skilled global personnel. The company emphasizes its ongoing efforts to anticipate and respond to external disturbances—such as government-imposed travel restrictions, cancellation rate fluctuations, digital markets and data-privacy regulations, anti-trust inquiries, and sustainability mandates—by reallocating resources, reconfiguring operating models, broadening supplier and affiliate networks, and developing governance and compliance functions designed to preserve system integrity, operational flexibility, and competitive advantage across diverse jurisdictions, thereby preserving or improving firm performance and emerging stronger from disruptive events.

The Company acknowledges a broad spectrum of internal and external pressures that may threaten its operations and financial performance and has established an enterprise risk management framework, approved by the Board, that articulates risk appetite and assigns accountability for identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks through the Global Risk Committee and specialized subcommittees. It maintains systems and procedures—including policies, controls, reporting and escalation protocols, periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews—to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and to manage conduct, fiduciary, anti-money laundering, privacy, model, and third-party risks. To preserve functioning under adverse conditions, the Company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity, and scalability of its technology platforms, maintains backup and recovery infrastructure, routinely tests business continuity and disaster recovery plans, implements incident management programs, and monitors early-warning indicators. The Company employs liquidity policies and contingency funding plans, holds high-quality liquid assets, and uses diverse funding sources—client cash sweeps, investment securities, secured and unsecured credit lines, repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and capital markets issuances—to meet obligations in both normal and stressed scenarios and conducts regular liquidity and capital stress testing, including net interest revenue and economic value of equity simulations using parallel and non-parallel interest‐rate shocks. In 2022, in response to rapid increases in short‐term rates and client cash reallocations, the Company limited new portfolio investments, utilized supplemental term funding, and transferred significant securities from Available-for-Sale to Held-to-Maturity to reduce exposure to unrealized losses, while coordinating a firm-wide transition team to ensure orderly phasing out of LIBOR and implementation of fallback provisions. During the COVID-19 pandemic and in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Company adapted by increasing client service staffing, enhancing online self-service capabilities, replacing vendor resources, and reconfiguring technology build-out plans to maintain service quality and complete integration work, demonstrating resilience through proactive resource allocation, dynamic risk mitigation, and strategic adjustments to preserve integrity and performance under exceptional conditions.

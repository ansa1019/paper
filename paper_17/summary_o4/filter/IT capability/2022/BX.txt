The Company acknowledges that “in the face of a difficult market or economic environment, we may need to reduce our fixed costs and other expenses in order to maintain profitability,” including cutting services or personnel, and that “a failure to manage or reduce our costs and other expenses within a time frame sufficient to match any decrease in profitability would adversely affect our operating performance,” reflecting its need to reallocate resources rapidly under pressure. It recognizes that “turmoil in the global financial markets can provoke significant volatility of equity and debt securities prices,” requiring ongoing risk assessment and adjustment of capital deployment and asset management strategies. The Company’s liquidity strategy includes a $4.135 billion revolving credit facility, which alongside cash and cash equivalents, supports business continuity and funding of capital commitments. The potential reoccurrence of a pandemic or severe public health crisis “could increase the possibility of periods of increased restrictions on business operations, which may adversely impact our business … and exacerbate many of the other risks discussed,” underscoring the importance of crisis response and emergency management procedures, including disaster recovery and business continuity programs. The transition to remote work is acknowledged as “heightened operational risk,” given its potential to “impact employee morale, integration of new employees and preservation of our culture” and its increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, requiring enhanced security policies, procedures, training and monitoring across both internal platforms and third‐party service providers. The Company also notes its reliance on technology infrastructure and third‐party platforms for core operations and recognizes the need for “proactive measures” and “contingency arrangements” to mitigate threats to system integrity, data protection and operational continuity in the event of cyberattacks or system failures. It strives to “maintain a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests,” and underscores the necessity of “develop[ing] and implement[ing] the right processes and tools” to preserve organizational health and support interdepartmental coordination in turbulent markets. In acknowledging the potential for significant market disruptions, regulatory changes or credit market contractions to impair the timing and value of investment realizations, the Company emphasizes the importance of adaptability, strategic foresight, and continuous monitoring of external pressures to preserve its financial flexibility and sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

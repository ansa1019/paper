The Company acknowledges that if it is not able to manage change and growth—through expanding international operations, scaling its streaming service to reliably handle anticipated growth in members and features, building expertise across creative, marketing, legal, finance and licensing disciplines and refining its corporate culture, systems and operational practices—it may face integration and operational challenges, unknown liabilities and reputational concerns that could adversely affect its business; it further recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, prompting active monitoring and contingency actions—including potential alterations to content production and distribution—to maintain service continuity and functionality under exceptional conditions; it identifies cybersecurity threats, unauthorized access to its systems or those of third parties, and network operator restrictions as hazards that could result in loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data or impaired access, thereby emphasizing ongoing investments in security measures, third-party “cloud” computing resilience and its proprietary global content delivery network to mitigate risks and preserve system integrity; additionally, the long-term, largely fixed cost nature of its content commitments and indebtedness may limit its operating flexibility, hindering its ability to adjust resource deployment in response to adverse macroeconomic conditions or revenue shortfalls, underscoring its reliance on liquidity management, capital market access and strategic financing and risk mitigation strategies to sustain operations, support operational continuity and adapt to environmental perturbations.

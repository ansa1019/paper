Nike’s 2021 Form 10-K acknowledges the need to maintain operations and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by detailing its pandemic-driven business continuity and crisis management efforts, including rearranging operations for social distancing, temperature checks, COVID-19 testing and disinfection protocols, remote-work arrangements, and disaster recovery and business continuity planning to address business slowdowns, store closures, supply chain disruptions and distribution-center interruptions. The company stresses its operational flexibility in sourcing—through its Nike Trading Company hub, factory-currency exposure index adjustments and diversification of contract manufacturers—and its commitment to rapidly identifying alternative suppliers, replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations and repairing damage to information-technology and supply systems to preserve product fulfillment and service levels. Nike describes its global foreign-exchange hedging, risk-management and capital-allocation programs as mechanisms to absorb currency and commodity fluctuations, reduce exposure to environmental perturbations and sustain financial resources and liquidity. The report also underscores the importance of end-to-end technology investments, digital commerce acceleration, organizational realignment and streamlined leadership structures as strategic agility and transformation measures designed to enhance adaptability, mitigate operational risks such as cybersecurity breaches and system failures, and support continued performance and competitive advantage under extreme, volatile or unexpected market conditions.

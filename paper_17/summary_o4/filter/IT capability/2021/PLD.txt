Our disclosures recognize that our global operations face myriad pressures—from regulatory, political and economic risks in multiple jurisdictions and volatility in currencies and capital markets, to localized downturns, climate‐related hazards, natural disasters (including seismic, hurricane and flood risk), pandemics and cyber security incidents—that could disrupt financing, staffing, development, leasing and day‐to‐day operations; to mitigate these risks and preserve business continuity we employ “natural hedges” by borrowing in functional currencies, enter into derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange and interest rate exposure, maintain disaster recovery plans, carry targeted insurance for property damage, rental loss and environmental liabilities, and monitor evolving regulatory, environmental and energy efficiency requirements; we manage liquidity through diversified credit facilities and capital markets access, strategic dispositions and contributions to co‐investment ventures, targeted capital deployment in development, acquisitions and property improvements, and regular refinancing or repurchase of higher‐cost debt to optimize interest expense and maturity profiles; we also leverage organizational flexibility and resource allocation across consolidated and unconsolidated portfolios, maintain rigorous internal controls and compliance programs, engage in proactive supply chain and workforce planning (including remote‐working capabilities), and continually assess our development and leasing pipelines to adapt our operating portfolio to market shifts, thereby supporting our capacity to absorb strain, respond effectively to disruptive events and maintain or enhance our performance under challenging and uncertain conditions.

The company reports a range of measures to preserve organizational resilience, defined as its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity, by continuously monitoring public health mandates, imposing operational restrictions or suspending operations at key production sites to protect employee health and safety, and adapting production rates—including temporary suspension and later resumption of operations at Puget Sound, South Carolina and Philadelphia—to manage pandemic‐related disruptions, social‐distancing requirements, increased absenteeism and part shortages. It emphasizes its ongoing engagement with federal, state and municipal health authorities, supplier partners and customers to mitigate near‐term production inefficiencies and additional operating costs, and reprioritize resources toward inspections, rework and readiness activities for the 787 and 777X programs. To maintain financial resilience and operational continuity, the company has conserved cash through reduced capital expenditures, suspended dividends, share‐based contributions to its 401(k) plan, and disciplined liquidity management involving cash, short‐term investments and undrawn revolvers, while acknowledging potential constraints on access to financing due to credit rating pressures. The report also highlights supply chain risk assessments and reliance on key subcontractors, cybersecurity and business disruption contingencies, environmental and climate‐change compliance strategies, and the need for adaptive contracting practices—such as cumulative contract catch‐up adjustments and reach‐forward loss recognition on fixed‐price development programs like the KC-46A, VC-25B and Commercial Crew—to reconfigure timelines and cost estimates under evolving external requirements. Additional disclosures address defense funding uncertainties, union-related labor stoppage risks, customer financing concentration, pension funding variability and regulatory and geopolitical pressures, underscoring the company’s systemic perspective, risk mitigation mechanisms and strategic agility in maintaining performance and integrity under challenging conditions.

The company’s disclosures underscore its resilience through extensive business continuity measures and adaptive operational strategies in response to internal and external disturbances, notably the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted remote work arrangements, temporary retail closures subject to health-and-safety restrictions, supply chain reconfigurations and ongoing monitoring and actions aligned with governmental requirements. The risk factors outline the potential for political events, trade disputes, natural disasters, industrial accidents, cybersecurity attacks and other interruptions to harm or disrupt operations, noting the reliance on single or limited outsourcing partners and the consequent need for recovery time, significant expenditures to resume operations and potential loss of sales. System redundancy, disaster recovery planning and insurance coverage for certain losses are maintained to mitigate adverse impacts, although these measures may be insufficient for all eventualities. The company invests significantly in research and development as a strategic tool to preserve competitive advantage, innovate new products and services and improve operational flexibility, while managing manufacturing purchase obligations, lease commitments and capital expenditures to secure resource availability and deploy financial resources effectively. The use of derivative hedging to address foreign currency fluctuations, the maintenance of substantial cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, and continued access to debt markets are highlighted as critical components of financial robustness. Additionally, the company’s risk management includes maintaining supplier codes of conduct, data security measures such as encryption and multifactor authentication, and provisions for legal, tax and regulatory contingencies, all of which support its capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning under adverse conditions and sustain integrity and performance amid a dynamic business environment.

During periods of rapid growth or decline in customer demand, the company faces significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, workforce training and assimilation, and appropriately sizing its supply chain infrastructure and facilities, and therefore continuously reassesses its strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment to ensure that it neither lacks the infrastructure and resources needed to scale up nor expands capacity too rapidly. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Lam Research implemented modifications to its business processes, activated business continuity plans, developed and qualified alternative sources of supply, imposed social distancing measures requiring changes to manufacturing processes, disrupted on-site staffing in manufacturing and R&D and transitioned a large portion of the workforce to teleworking, all of which have affected production, logistics, capital expansion and financial results. The company employs cost management programs to align expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, continues to invest in R&D, customer support capabilities and joint development relationships to drive innovation and adaptability, and maintains critical information systems with ISO 27001-compliant safeguards, intrusion prevention, identity and access controls and emergency recovery processes to mitigate cybersecurity risks. It hedges foreign currency exposures, preserves liquidity through cash reserves, commercial paper and revolving credit arrangements, and evaluates dividend and share repurchase policies against capital requirements, debt covenants and onshore cash availability. Supplier diversification strategies, environmental and regulatory compliance efforts, intellectual property protections, and talent acquisition and retention initiatives further support the companyâ€™s ability to absorb internal and external disturbances, preserve operational flexibility and maintain performance under pressure.

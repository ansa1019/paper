The 10-K’s risk factors and MD&A detail multiple facets of organizational resilience, noting that “the pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and operating results” and that “pandemic-related restrictions on, or disruptions of, transportation networks and supply chain shortages” could materially impair “business continuity” and network expansion. They emphasize supply-chain resilience by acknowledging that “we depend heavily on suppliers, service providers, their subcontractors and other third parties for us to efficiently operate our business” and that “disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.” Cybersecurity disclosures acknowledge that “unauthorized access to confidential information is difficult to anticipate, detect or prevent,” require that “procedures and safeguards … must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever-evolving threat landscape,” and describe the “forensic investigation,” “resetting personal identification numbers,” and provision of “identity protection services” in response to the August 2021 criminal cyberattack as critical recovery and mitigation measures. Under “System Failures and Business Disruptions,” management warns that “physical damage, power surges or outages … severe weather and natural disasters, which may occur more frequently or with greater intensity as a result of global climate change,” “human error,” “unauthorized access,” or “system failures or outages” could “prevent us from providing reliable service,” with remediation costs encompassing “repairing infrastructure and systems” and customer “incentives.” The narrative on technological adaptation emphasizes the need “to adapt to changes in available technology,” “continually invest in our network,” and manage “implementation issues” to achieve operational flexibility. Integration risks from the Sprint merger are characterized by “diversion of management attention,” “difficulties in integrating operations and systems,” and the “need to address possible differences in corporate cultures, management philosophies, and compensation structures,” reflecting the company’s change-management and organizational reconfiguration efforts. Finally, as a “critical communications infrastructure provider,” the company underscores its focus “on providing crucial connectivity to our customers and impacted communities while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees,” demonstrating its systemic perspective on resilience under exceptional conditions.

The company discloses that it maintains comprehensive programs and processes to prevent, detect and respond to data and cyber security incidents, including the implementation of binding corporate rules under the EU GDPR and enhanced controls under state privacy laws, and that it regularly reviews, upgrades and enhances its policies to address evolving regulatory requirements and sophisticated threats. It invests client funds in highly liquid, investment-grade securities with laddered maturities and employs short-term financing arrangements—commercial paper, reverse repurchase agreements and committed credit facilities—to satisfy funding obligations and preserve liquidity under adverse market conditions. The firm has established disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans to protect its operations against natural disasters, power or communication failures, military or terrorist actions and public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic; it has continuously upgraded its cloud-based payroll, workforce management and “return to workplace” solutions, supported remote working, and provided clients with tools and information to navigate relief programs, thereby maintaining critical services without interruption. Concurrently, the company is executing broad-based transformation initiatives designed to streamline organizational structure, strengthen talent and culture, drive sustainable margin improvement and fund strategic investments in research and development, next-generation platforms and data analytics, while closely monitoring key performance metrics, maintaining sufficient free cash flow and financial flexibility, and reinforcing its governance frameworks to adapt to regulatory, operational and market pressures.

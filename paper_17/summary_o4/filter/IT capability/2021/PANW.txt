The Company discloses that, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and rapidly evolving public health guidance, it transitioned its employee population to remote work, adopted precautionary measures intended to mitigate health risks to employees, channel partners, end-customers, and communities, and continues to monitor and adjust its policies as new information and vaccinations become available, while recognizing that these measures could delay sales cycles, lengthen supply-chain lead times, and impair forecasting. It acknowledges that its operations and financial results are subject to external pressures—such as global economic uncertainty, currency fluctuations, geopolitical events, supply shortages, manufacturing and logistics delays, and credit and liquidity risks of channel partners and end-customers—and outlines risk-mitigation protocols, including monitoring customer payment capability, maintaining business continuity plans, and engaging in contingency planning for regulatory changes and market disruptions. The 10-K emphasizes that to manage future growth effectively it must improve and expand its information technology and financial infrastructure, its operating and administrative systems and controls, and its ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner, noting that failure to do so could disrupt end-customer relationships, increase costs, and harm performance under pressure. It describes investments in cloud-based subscription offerings, data-center and hosting service capacity, and training and retaining qualified personnel as critical to preserving operational flexibility, supporting service continuity, and maintaining system integrity. Finally, the Company highlights its reliance on cross-functional coordination, dynamic resource allocation, and ongoing evaluation of its global corporate and tax structures to preserve organizational resilience, adaptability, and continuity under nominal, extreme, or exceptional internal and external variations and disturbances.

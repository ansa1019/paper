Disclosures emphasize that disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events may delay production and delivery of merchandise to warehouses, adversely affecting sales and member satisfaction, and that the company has made and may continue to make substantial investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of its supply chains and delivery channels. The availability and performance of information technology systems are described as vital to business continuity, with recognition that failures or disruptions could impair the ability to process transactions, track inventory and support decision‐making, and that large technology and IT transformation projects—including investments to build strong digital resiliency against power outages, security breaches, catastrophic events and internal errors—are underway to mitigate risk, restore services more quickly, and preserve operational flexibility. The company also highlights the need to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information in compliance with evolving regulations, noting that cybersecurity attacks and increased remote work have expanded threat surfaces and that its cybersecurity and compliance efforts, together with reinsurance programs and captive insurance mechanisms, seek to limit exposures and support recovery in the event of incidents. In discussing the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, management acknowledges highly unpredictable and volatile effects on supply chain operations, labor availability, in-stock positions, costs of doing business and consumer demand, warning that failure to respond appropriately or the perception of an inadequate response could damage reputation, cause lost sales and trigger litigation or regulatory action, while the company has implemented incremental wages and operational adjustments to maintain member service and support business continuity. Management’s discussion further underscores the company’s historical success in adapting business practices to changing competitive and economic conditions—through adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix, increased penetration of private-label items and online offerings—and the importance of sustaining member loyalty, consistent product quality and strategic warehouse expansions to maintain performance under pressure. Finally, a range of market and external risks—such as fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, currency exchange rates, climate change regulations, natural disasters, public health emergencies and supplier constraints—are identified alongside reliance on bank credit facilities, short-term investments and deferred membership fee revenues as strategic tools to ensure sufficient financial resources, preserve system integrity and enable positive adjustment under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

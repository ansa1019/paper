The Company discloses that natural disasters, pandemics, economic, political, regulatory actions, acts of war or threats of war and similar developments could disrupt its supply chain, manufacturing and distribution capabilities and that its business continuity plans and other safeguards might not always be effective to fully mitigate their impact, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused closures of stores, factories and offices and restrictions on manufacturing, distribution and travel, and which continues to pose risks to its operations, cash flows and financial position. It acknowledges reliance on third-party contract manufacturers and electronics suppliers, including single or limited sources for key components, and the global semiconductor shortage that has constrained IQOS device supply, noting that although it monitors supplier capacity and financial health and has contingency plans—including domestic production and a targeted return to unconstrained device availability—it cannot guarantee uninterrupted commercialization of its reduced-risk products. The Company further describes its continuous evolution of business continuity planning and backup systems to enhance resilience against cybersecurity threats and information system failures, which otherwise could result in operational disruption, revenue loss, reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action. In addition, the Company identifies the complexity and uncertainty involved in integrating recent acquisitions—such as the challenge of combining disparate organizations, systems, compliance programs, technology platforms and cultures and retaining key management and employees—and warns that its ability to realize anticipated benefits depends on maintaining critical business and operational relationships in the acquired entities. Finally, the Company emphasizes its use of prudent planning and forward-looking assumptions while recognizing that unforeseen risks, regulatory changes and external pressures may materially affect its strategic response, operational flexibility and overall resilience.

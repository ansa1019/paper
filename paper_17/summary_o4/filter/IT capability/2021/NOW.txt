In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to focus on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business; starting late 2021, many employees began to return to our offices for at least part of the week, and our return-to-work approach may vary among geographies depending on appropriate health protocols and the severity of or spikes in COVID-19, but these operational changes have not affected and are not expected to affect our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. The transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases our customersâ€™ resiliency and security and delivers great experiences and additional value to their employees and consumers. Our business depends on our platform to be available without disruption; however, we experience defects, disruptions, outages and other performance and quality problems arising from our increasing use of the public cloud, third-party software, and errors in developing, delivering, configuring or hosting our services, as well as incidents outside our control, including denial-of-service or ransomware attacks. We serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and co-located in third-party data centers around the world, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, power loss, sabotage or operator error; despite precautions and our crisis management and disaster response plans, interruptions have occurred and could recur, making it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services, potentially decreasing demand and causing substantial expense. If we or our third-party service providers experience an actual or perceived cybersecurity event or a digital supply chain attack, our platform may be perceived as insecure, we may lose customers and incur significant liabilities, and our ability to provide critical services could be disrupted despite substantial financial and personnel resources devoted to security measures and data governance. We rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues and to deliver professional services; if these partners fail to perform, misrepresent functionality or violate laws or our policies, our operational flexibility may be constrained, our ability to meet customer needs may be impaired, and our results could suffer. Natural disasters, climate-related events and other catastrophic occurrences beyond our control may disrupt our operations, international commerce and the global economy; although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans and insurance, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services, could decrease demand and could cause us to incur substantial expense. The extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerging regulatory requirements, global economic volatility, evolving cybersecurity threats and the threat of extreme environmental events underscore the importance of continuous risk assessment, resource allocation, adaptive strategies and recovery planning to preserve organizational health, maintain performance under pressure and enhance system integrity.

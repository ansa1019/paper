In response to the pandemic, the corporation has reinforced and continues to execute business continuity plans designed to preserve critical business operations and customer services under internal or external failures of information-technology infrastructure, rates of employee unavailability and governmental restrictions, thereby supporting maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The corporation regularly updates the systems on which it relies to support its operations and growth, integrates remote access tools and technology into its operational model and manages reliance on third parties, recognizing that operational risk exposure exists throughout the organization as a result of such interactions. A formal enterprise risk framework, approved by the board, articulates risk appetite and governs the ongoing identification, measurement, monitoring and control of strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks, while contingency funding and recovery planning—including diversified funding sources, stress testing under multiple scenarios and capital and liquidity buffers—helps ensure the organization’s capacity to absorb disruptions, deploy resources and preserve integrity and performance. These measures seek to mitigate hazards ranging from cyberattacks to natural disasters and enable adaptability and resilience; however, the corporation cautions that failures in business continuity plans, inadequacies in risk management frameworks or severe disruptions in financial and operational systems could materially impair its ability to maintain functioning and positive adjustment under adversity.

During 2021, the Company demonstrated maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by rapidly adapting its operations and resource allocations to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, including protecting employee health, implementing remote work protocols, adjusting production schedules, and accelerating $2.2 billion of payments to suppliers to preserve business continuity and supply-chain integrity. The F-35 production rebaseline agreed with the Joint Program Office in September 2021 illustrates the organization’s ability to reconfigure temporal trajectories of response toward disruptive events, recover aircraft shortfalls realized during the pandemic, and establish predictability and stability in the production process. Strategic financial measures—most notably the purchase of $4.9 billion of group annuity contracts to transfer defined benefit pension obligations to an insurance company—reflected an intentional reconfiguration of resources to absorb strain and reduce funding volatility, thereby preserving plan integrity and cash flow. Concurrently, the Company’s balanced cash deployment strategy, including opportunistic capital expenditures, independent research and development investments, selective acquisitions and divestitures, and continued access to commercial paper and revolving credit facilities, underscores operational flexibility, risk mitigation, and future orientation in response to budgetary constraints and continuing resolutions. The use of performance-based progress payments and cost-reimbursable pricing under FAR, together with active management of deferred tax assets related to research and development amortization requirements, further evidences the Company’s systemic perspective on resource generation and recovery, ensuring the partial maintenance of integrity and performance under both nominal and extraordinary internal and external perturbations.

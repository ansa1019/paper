In its risk disclosures, the company acknowledges that maintaining business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions requires mitigation efforts that may not always succeed and that its business and the companies in which it invests are materially affected by economic, market and external shocks beyond its control, such as financial market volatility, capital constraints, or the global COVID-19 pandemic. It has adopted contingency planning and business continuity measures, including a business continuity plan, contingency plans for key personnel, remote working arrangements, mandatory vaccination and testing initiatives, and enhancements to technology infrastructure and disaster recovery programs, but recognizes that these cannot anticipate every scenario and may be insufficient to prevent financial loss, operational disruption, or reputational damage. The firm highlights the fundamental dependence of its operations on robust information systems, cybersecurity controls and third-party services, noting that failures, incapacitations or breaches in these systems could disrupt processing, impair liquidity or expose it to regulatory sanctions. It further discusses its substantial liquidity requirements—to fund strategic initiatives, new strategies, capital commitments for existing and future investment vehicles, underwriting obligations, debt service, and potential contingent liabilities—and the challenges that adverse market conditions may pose to generating sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations. The document also underscores the importance of organizational flexibility, collaboration, and an inclusive culture, as well as the critical role of key personnel and sound governance in executing its complex growth strategy across private equity, credit, real assets and insurance, while warning that rapid expansion into new markets, partnerships, and lines of business may introduce additional risks that could undermine its ability to adapt, allocate resources efficiently, and sustain performance under extreme or disruptive events.

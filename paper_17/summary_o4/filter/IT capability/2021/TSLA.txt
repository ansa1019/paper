In response to macroeconomic disruptions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide, instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions, and managed temporary impediments to administrative activities that hampered our product deliveries and deployments. We continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally, and deploy production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Sustaining our production trajectory requires the ongoing readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation, including for travel and visa allowances. We encountered unanticipated supplier issues and intermittent component shortages—such as semiconductor shortfalls and port congestion—that led to launch and ramp delays, and we promptly addressed these challenges while continuing to improve manufacturing processes, implement design workaround solutions and reduce costs. Our ability to increase global production and affordability depends on accessing localized supply chains, expanding and managing localized design and engineering talent, accurately forecasting, procuring, warehousing and transporting high volumes of components, and maintaining adequate battery-cell supply either through third-party partners or our own cell manufacturing efforts to preserve production continuity under raw-material volatility. We continue to expand and harden our information-technology systems as operations grow, maintain cybersecurity measures, encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities and remediate identified security issues to protect against disruptions. We manage risks associated with product defects and potential liability claims through extensive internal testing, rapid issue remediation, recalls when necessary and enhanced safety procedures. We cooperate with government investigations and continually refine our disclosure controls and governance-related measures to mitigate regulatory and reputational risks. To maintain organizational health and performance under pressure, we invest in recruiting, training and retaining qualified personnel, adapt our capital and operating expenditure plans to the pace of our factory ramp-ups and product launches, and build flexibility into our manufacturing and logistical operations so that we can preserve system integrity, respond effectively to unexpected events and uphold positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

In our annual report, we describe multiple operational measures and potential disruptions that directly bear on our organizational resilience, including extensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans required by clients and regulators and subject to frequent testing, and the risk that the failure of these plans or supply chain issues—such as factory closures, shipping delays, workforce shortages, increased lead times, material component shortages and higher costs—could prevent us from meeting client service levels or contractual obligations, resulting in lost revenue or legal disputes. We note the interconnectedness of global financial system participants, whereby disruptions at any node—due to natural disasters, pandemics, cyberattacks, human error, hardware or software defects, power losses or political conflicts—could interrupt service availability and integrity, and we rely on a business continuity program to recover critical business functions, assets and data. We have modified our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic—restricting travel, limiting non-essential visitors, disinfecting facilities, providing on-site testing and personal protective equipment, establishing safety protocols and mandating employee vaccination—to preserve operational continuity under challenging conditions, though acknowledging no certainty that such measures will fully mitigate risk. We recognize the need to invest significant resources in information security and controls to detect and remediate vulnerabilities, and we maintain diversified liquidity sources—including cash flow from operations, cash reserves, commercial paper programs and revolving credit facilities—to ensure access to financial resources under stress. We manage operational flexibility and resource allocation through active portfolio management, synergies from acquisitions and divestitures, disciplined capital structure maintenance, and integration activities to reconfigure our organization swiftly in response to environmental perturbations, thereby aiming to sustain performance, mitigate risk and preserve the integrity of our systems and services when faced with both nominal and extreme adverse events.

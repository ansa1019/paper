Abbott’s resilience is reflected in its continued investment in sophisticated information technology systems and cyber-security measures and the ongoing monitoring of potential threats and vulnerabilities, its strategic alignment and restructuring of manufacturing networks and inventory management to mitigate supply chain disruptions and respond to shifting demand—evidenced by the realignment of its diagnostic products segment in 2021—and its proactive maintenance of liquidity and financial flexibility through revolving credit facilities, hedging arrangements and targeted debt management, all of which support continuity of operations and absorption of external pressures and financial shocks; rigorous risk management practices, including systematic provisioning for credit losses, legal contingencies and impairment testing of intangible assets, underpin its ability to preserve organizational integrity and performance despite regulatory changes, operational failures or legal challenges; its agile research and development and product‐launch processes, demonstrated by the rapid mobilization of cross-functional teams to develop, obtain emergency use authorizations for and distribute multiple COVID-19 diagnostic tests globally, illustrate its capacity to adapt, reconfigure resources and project and reconstitute temporal response trajectories toward disruptive events; and its disciplined capital allocation to defined benefit pension plans, research and development programs and strategic acquisitions or divestitures further evidences an organizational capability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and emerge stronger from adversity.

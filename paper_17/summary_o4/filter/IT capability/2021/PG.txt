The company’s disclosures describe its maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through comprehensive risk management and continuity planning across its operations. It identifies a broad spectrum of internal and external disturbances—including macroeconomic volatility, currency fluctuations, political instability, trade policy shifts, cyber-security breaches, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorism, disease outbreaks and pandemics—that may disrupt its global supply chain, manufacturing and distribution networks, and retail relationships. In response, the company invests in supply-chain optimization, sole-source arrangements, extended supplier payment terms and collaborative financing, as well as redundancy in IT/OT systems supported by rigorous cyber-resilience and business-continuity plans. The firm emphasizes its capacity to mitigate commodity-price and logistics cost pressures through productivity improvements, pricing actions and sourcing strategies, while maintaining agility in product innovation, marketing, and customer engagement to address emerging competitive and consumer trends. Its organizational structure—comprising sector business units, enterprise markets, global business services and corporate functions—provides a systemic perspective to reallocate resources, implement corrective actions, and reconfigure operational trajectories in real time. The disclosures underscore the company’s ongoing efforts to manage third-party relationships, protect brand and data integrity, and preserve liquidity and financial flexibility via strong cash generation, committed credit facilities and disciplined capital allocation, thereby sustaining functioning and enabling adaptation and recovery under varying scales and sources of stress.

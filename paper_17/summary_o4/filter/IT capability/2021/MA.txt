Mastercard’s operations are supported by risk management policies and procedures, including collateral requirements, participant default policies and procedures, and capital and financial resource requirements designed to absorb strain and preserve system performance under internal or external variations. Our multi‐rail strategy and expansion of products and services have necessitated the allocation of additional resources to obtain new regulatory licenses and strengthen compliance, operational flexibility and continuity of clearing and settlement activities. We maintain an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts of technology malfunctions, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, cyber‐attacks or other catastrophic events, and develop effective response and recovery strategies. Operational continuity efforts encompass modifications to business practices, including remote and hybrid work arrangements, as well as enhanced infrastructure and monitoring when onboarding new customers and end users. Our multi‐rail payments network and real‐time account‐based platform are managed to ensure safety and security, including the ability to complete timely transaction switching, adapt system rules and procedures (subject to regulatory approval), and address operational challenges that may arise in diverse geographies. In addition, we employ hedging strategies to mitigate currency and exchange risk, guarantee settlement obligations under potential customer defaults, and deploy data governance, quality and privacy‐by‐design practices to maintain integrity and performance under evolving regulatory and technological pressures. Despite robust controls, we recognize that no measures can fully eliminate resilience challenges, and we continuously invest in strategic initiatives, technology solutions and partnerships to support ongoing adaptation and preservation of organizational performance under adverse conditions.

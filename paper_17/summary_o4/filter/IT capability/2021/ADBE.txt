Adobe’s organizational resilience is reflected in its adaptive response to the COVID-19 pandemic through prolonged office closures, phased voluntary reopenings, enhanced workplace health and safety protocols and flexible hybrid work arrangements, as well as the rapid shift to virtual‐only customer, employee and industry events, all intended to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company continuously monitors evolving public health measures, including physical distancing and travel restrictions, and adjusts its policies and practices—such as potential re-closures or additional safety investments—to preserve operational continuity. Business continuity is further supported by robust disaster recovery planning for data centers and network infrastructure, including redundancy assessments, unplanned migration exercises, capacity-planning to absorb demand spikes, and supply chain resilience measures to mitigate hardware and service disruptions. Comprehensive risk management programs deploy preventative and corrective security controls, code hardening, rigorous penetration testing, regular audits against independent security frameworks, and improved incident response processes to safeguard system integrity and data availability. The subscription-based business model, with revenue recognized ratably over contract terms, underpins predictable cash flows and informed resource allocation, while investments in remote collaboration tools and digital-first engagement platforms enable swift adaptation to unexpected situations. Together, these strategies and mechanisms empower Adobe to absorb strain from internal and external perturbations, preserve core functionalities, and reconfigure operations to sustain performance and emerge stronger from crises.

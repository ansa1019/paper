In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented rigorous remote-work protocols supported by our robust technology infrastructure, leveraging videoconferencing and frequent leadership communications to maintain collaboration, preserve operational continuity and reinforce our culture across a distributed workforce. We maintain multiple sources of liquidity—including a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, corporate treasury investments and realized fund allocations—to meet capital needs, fund operations and sustain our investment strategies under varying market conditions. Our disaster recovery and business continuity programs, while subject to continuous enhancement, underpin our capacity to preserve functioning during internal or external disruptions. We deploy comprehensive risk-management frameworks to mitigate concentration and counterparty risk, including diversification of prime brokers and collateral assets, structured liquidity commitments and credit-underwriting discipline aligned with evolving regulatory guidance. We have transitioned from reliance on physical data centers to cloud-based services to enhance infrastructure resilience while accepting new operational dependencies, and we invest in cybersecurity measures to safeguard critical systems and sensitive information. Across our businesses, we emphasize strategic initiatives and process innovations to adapt to supply-chain constraints, labor market shifts, remote client engagement and regulatory changes, all of which support our ability to maintain performance, manage resource allocation effectively and preserve organizational coherence in the face of dynamic environmental perturbations.

We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, related third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which TI operates; we have experienced, and continue to experience, short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results; our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions, including trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers, which impact our ability to deliver products and product support into China, cause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results; we are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions and epidemics, labor conditions, climate change risks and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate; our ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives could affect our business plans and operating results; we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations, and climate change might exacerbate these occurrences or cause natural disasters to occur with greater frequency; we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner and our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities; suppliers of these items have and might continue to extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect our results of operations; our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity events, breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties, which could compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages; our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations, with additional sources including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to debt markets through a variable rate, revolving credit facility, and we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months; as we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than historical levels; our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is supported by discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities, which spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities, invest in new manufacturing capacity or think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners, and efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent; and we make our investments with an eye toward long-term strengthening and leveraging of our four sustainable competitive advantages—a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels that provides better insight and knowledge of customer needs, and the diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions—that help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners.

PepsiCo has developed and implemented health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on employees and business operations.  The company leverages an integrated risk management framework that includes the PepsiCo Risk Committee, division and market risk committees, a risk management office, corporate audit and compliance functions to identify, assess, prioritize and address strategic, financial, operational and reputational risks.  To enhance operational flexibility and efficiency, the company continually identifies and implements multi-year productivity initiatives, including an enterprise-wide systems transformation to migrate financial processing and other functions to shared service platforms.  PepsiCo regularly reviews its capital structure with its Board of Directors, including dividend policy and share repurchase activity, and believes its cash-generating capability, liquidity facilities and financing strategies will be adequate to support its operating, investing and financing needs and sustain business continuity.  The company monitors changes in the retail landscape and explores initiatives to build global e-commerce and direct-to-consumer capabilities, as well as diversified distribution channels, to adapt to evolving consumer preferences.  Recognizing the importance of system resilience, PepsiCo devotes significant resources to network security, disaster recovery and information technology infrastructure to safeguard business communications, data integrity, inventory management and facility operations against cyber incidents and other disruptions.  Through PepsiCo Positive, a strategic end-to-end transformation with sustainability at its core, the company is transforming sourcing, manufacturing and consumer engagement models to drive long-term growth while promoting agility, resource optimization and resilience in the face of environmental, economic and regulatory challenges.

The company discloses that its organizational resilience is tested by the COVID-19 pandemic, which “have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect” on clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, sales and overall business performance. It emphasizes risk mitigation and crisis response measures, noting that “significant disruptions or production failures at” its major manufacturing sites “could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials,” and describing reliance on backup diesel generators during Puerto Rico’s “hurricane maria” aftermath, ongoing use of backup power after “2020 earthquakes” and contingency measures for “lockdowns … imposing restrictions on business operations.” The company also highlights its dependence on “sophisticated information technology systems … some of which are managed … by third parties,” warning that “a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our … systems and data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation,” and it “continues to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical … systems.” Further resilience challenges stem from its reliance on “unaﬃliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components,” concentration of sales through three wholesalers and one dialysis clinic operator, potential “financial or other difficulties” at distributors, and “legislative initiatives” to reallocate manufacturing capacity under the Defense Production Act, all of which highlight the company’s need for operational flexibility, supply chain continuity, resource reconfiguring and ongoing risk assessment to maintain functionality under external pressures.

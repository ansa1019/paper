Our annual report emphasizes that our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve users depend on the reliable performance and redundancy of our technical infrastructure, which must be resilient to avoid performance delays or outages; we note that unanticipated errors, such as the six-hour service outage in October 2021, and rapidly evolving demands—from increased information sharing to pandemic-driven usage—may exceed our capacity to scale data centers, network capacity, and computing power, thereby adversely affecting user engagement and advertising revenue. We further acknowledge that our business may be disrupted by earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflicts, cyber-attacks, and similar catastrophic events; that global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of such events; and that failures to restore our technical infrastructure and recover user data in a timely manner may materially harm our financial results.  We highlight the risks posed by our reliance on third-party network providers and supply-chain partners—over whom we exercise limited control—who may face financial or logistical challenges, including COVID-19-related labor and component shortages, which have already forced adjustments to our procurement practices and could in the future result in interruptions to service delivery, delays in product introductions, or unfavorable terms that undermine our operational flexibility.  We describe potential unforeseen difficulties in designing, expanding, or testing key elements of our infrastructure—such as data centers, subsea and terrestrial cable systems, and other projects—and warn that project delays, component shortages, challenges in securing government approvals, or foreign government actions could degrade product quality, impair assets, or create inefficiencies.  Finally, we recognize that security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of data, phishing attacks, and other cyber incidents are persistent threats; although we have implemented systems and processes to protect and remediate, we cannot guarantee absolute security or timely response, and any failure in these measures could damage our competitive position, erode trust, and adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Our disclosures describe a range of capabilities and measures that support business continuity and system integrity under adverse conditions, including “disruptions to our manufacturing operations from natural disasters or other events,” “reductions in production levels” and “cessation of operations at any site or in any jurisdiction resulting from government restrictions on movement and/or business operations,” “disruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing and transportation of materials, components, equipment and engineering support” and “constraints within our supply chain for certain IC components” that may limit our ability to fulfill customer demand, “limited availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment and dependency on third-party service providers,” our “operations’ dependency on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes,” and the “high dependency on available sources of labor, materials, equipment, and services” for facility expansions; our response to the COVID-19 pandemic through “working from home, limiting the number of meeting attendees, quarantines of team members, contractors, or vendors,” “physical-distancing measures, working from home, upgrades to our sites, COVID-19 testing and vaccination, enhanced cleaning measures, and the increased use of personal protective equipment”; risk mitigation for “power outages, improperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures”; planning for “increases in costs for, or unavailability of, transportation, raw materials, components, electricity and/or other energy sources, or other inputs necessary for the operation of our business”; efforts to “protect our employees’ and contractors’ health and well-being” to preserve operations; initiatives to manage “constraints within our supply chain for certain IC components” and maintain manufacturing yields; security and resilience measures against “breaches of our security systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners” that could “expose us to losses and damage our reputation”; strategies to “attract, retain, and motivate executives and other highly skilled, diverse employees, as well as effectively manage or plan for succession for key employees” to ensure continuity; reliance on “benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments” conditional on maintaining investment and operational thresholds; and ongoing evaluation of our “manufacturing capacity analysis” and “capital expenditures” to optimize resource deployment and support our ability to preserve or improve functioning despite constraints and disturbances.

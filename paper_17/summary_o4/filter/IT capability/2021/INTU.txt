Intuit’s disclosures reflect an organizational resilience framework through its ongoing adaptation to internal and external variations and disturbances, notably its rapid operational shifts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic—including substantial modifications to employee work locations, travel policies, and a hybrid workplace model—while ensuring business continuity by investing in disaster recovery planning, cloud-based redundancies, ISO 27001-certified cybersecurity protections, and high-availability capabilities to guard against hazards ranging from cyberattacks and system failures to natural disasters and public health emergencies. The company routinely conducts risk assessments and mitigation—from monitoring counterparty risk under its unsecured and secured credit facilities to updating compliance protocols for evolving privacy, tax, and financial services regulations—and allocates significant resources to maintain platform availability during peak demand periods, secure supply chains and third-party partnerships, and support uninterrupted service delivery. Through strategic reorganization of technology and customer success functions, preservation of liquidity with $3.9 billion in cash, equivalents and investments, flexible financing arrangements, and targeted acquisitions like Credit Karma, Intuit demonstrates its ability to absorb strain, preserve integrity and performance, reconfigure resource deployment, and sustain competitive advantage, thereby embodying the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions as delineated by organizational resilience scholarship.

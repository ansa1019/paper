The Company’s disclosures convey a systemic perspective on resilience, describing the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions via crisis management, business continuity and supply chain flexibility. The global crisis management team “has focused on protecting our employees and customers, optimizing our operations and securing our supply chain,” including the implementation of business continuity plans involving a medical advisory group for employees, leveraging work‐from‐home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing and accelerating capabilities to provide remote physician support. The Company notes that “our ability to manufacture our products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our employees,” and warns that operational disruptions – from site shutdowns, workplace restrictions, raw material shortages, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or vendor capacity issues – could inhibit timely production, backup sourcing or alternative sterilization methods. To preserve operational flexibility and competitive advantage under extreme conditions, the Company has “undertaken restructuring and optimization initiatives to enhance our growth potential and position us for long‐term success,” including supply chain network optimization to maximize global manufacturing and distribution capacity and reallocating resources across functions, with anticipated expense reductions to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. The disclosures underscore ongoing “investment in meaningful research and development projects,” the need to “devote continued efforts and financial resources to the development or acquisition of scientifically advanced technologies and products,” and the integration of acquired businesses to reconstitute trajectories toward the future. The Company recognizes risks to its information systems and intellectual property from cyber-attacks and third-party vulnerabilities, stating that failures could disrupt operations or compromise data, and highlights established controls and escalation procedures to ensure that issues posing material risks are immediately reported to senior management and the board.

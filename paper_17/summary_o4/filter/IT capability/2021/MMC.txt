Our 10-K risk factors disclose that our inability to successfully recover from disasters or other business continuity or data recovery events—including earthquakes, hurricanes, cyberattacks, pandemics, power or telecommunications failures and third-party service interruptions—could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability, and we therefore regularly assess and improve our business continuity, disaster recovery, data recovery and key management succession plans; the company has adopted remote and hybrid work arrangements, health and safety protocols and strategic technology and infrastructure investments—including partnerships with technology firms—to enhance operational flexibility, maintain effective IT systems and networks and support a cost-efficient business model in the face of digital disruption; we rely on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information systems and vendor-supplied platforms, and we employ technical safeguards, employee training, access-control management and change-management initiatives to detect, mitigate and contain ever-evolving cyber-security threats, unauthorized access or other operational risks; strategic initiatives such as technology modernization, insurtech alliances, digital transformation and the integration of acquired businesses’ information systems are aimed at reinforcing our capacity to adapt to market volatility, competitive pressures from traditional and new entrants, and evolving client needs; our global footprint subjects us to macroeconomic, political, regulatory and legal variances—including data privacy, cyber-security and trade sanctions requirements—which we address through resource allocation to compliance, risk assessment and adaptability measures to preserve continuity and performance; financial resilience is further supported by diversified financing facilities, foreign currency and interest rate risk management, defined benefit pension funding strategies across jurisdictions and disciplined capital management—including share repurchase programs—to maintain liquidity, preserve organizational strength and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

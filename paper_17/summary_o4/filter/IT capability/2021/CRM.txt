The Company’s 2022 Form 10-K discloses a comprehensive suite of risk factors and mitigation measures that together constitute its approach to organizational resilience—defined by scholars as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions”—including its ability to absorb strain on personnel resources and infrastructure from supporting a growing customer base, scale operations to meet capacity requirements and maintain business continuity and disaster recovery arrangements despite service interruptions from third-party data center hosting failures, internet infrastructure fragmentation, natural disasters, public health emergencies or cyberattacks.  It emphasizes ongoing investments in enhanced business and data governance policies, internal security controls, crisis management and escalation processes, regular briefings to the board, cybersecurity committee and executive management on security events and continuous improvements in prevention, detection and remediation of vulnerabilities.  It acknowledges the complexity of integrating acquired technologies and companies—such as Slack, MuleSoft and other acquisitions—and the need to allocate financial resources, update operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, and adapt organizational practices and corporate culture to preserve firm performance and protect its competitive advantage under environmental perturbations, economic volatility, currency fluctuations, supply chain constraints, evolving regulatory requirements and shifting customer demands.  Liquidity and financial resilience are addressed through maintenance of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, unbilled contracted revenue and a $3 billion revolving credit facility, while strategic allocation of capital to research and development, data center capacity, professional services, sales and marketing supports agility, innovation and future-oriented growth.  The Company’s disclosures further reference climate-related risks and renewable energy commitments, sustainability-linked bond financing and crisis response plans as mechanisms to preserve system integrity, operational continuity, stakeholder engagement and long-term organizational strength in the face of disruptive events, hazards and exceptional conditions.

The company’s business continuity program has been effective to date, enabling nearly the entire employee population to work remotely since mid-March 2020 and maintain operations under extended remote-work conditions, though maintaining productivity, meeting client needs and safeguarding human capital and technology assets remains vulnerable to prolonged remote working. The firm regularly assesses and updates its business continuity plans and key management succession to address risks from cyber threats—heightened in a remote environment—natural or man-made disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures and other disruptions, but acknowledges that any failure to successfully recover from such events, including local or regional disasters or other continuity problems, could cause material financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm and legal liability. Reliance on network systems, third-party cloud infrastructure and outsourced services carries the risk of disruptions, unauthorized access or failures beyond internal control, with potential impacts on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, while a lack of redundancy in some office locations and dependence on clients’ own continuity resources may further constrain operational flexibility. The company commits significant resources to risk management, control and compliance, including cybersecurity measures, disaster recovery capabilities and continuous improvement of its control framework, but recognizes that material interruptions or malfunctions in its systems, or extended remote working conditions, could materially interrupt business operations and adversely affect its ability to serve customers, safeguard data and preserve organizational effectiveness under challenging conditions.

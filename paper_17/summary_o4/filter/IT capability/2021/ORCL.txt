The company acknowledges that it operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments presenting numerous uncontrollable and unpredictable risks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has materially affected how it and its customers operate their businesses, caused travel restrictions, quarantines and supply chain delays, and led to the cancellation or transformation of customer events—such as shifting Oracle OpenWorld to a virtual format—underscoring the need to respond, manage and adapt effectively to mitigate harm. It emphasizes that success depends on its ability to develop and differentiate new products and services, integrate acquired technologies, refresh and release cloud offerings, execute its evolving cloud computing strategy and anticipate cloud-computing needs to sustain profitability and competitive positioning. The company notes potential disruptions from coding, manufacturing or configuration errors that can impair functionality, integration, performance and security of its cloud, license and hardware offerings, and lead to service interruptions, outages or unanticipated costs that could adversely affect both its and its customers’ business operations and financial reporting. It recognizes dependencies on suppliers for critical technologies and components, which exposes its supply chain to disruptions from component shortages, natural disasters, public health crises and geopolitical factors, and accordingly continues to explore additional third-party manufacturing partners to drive continuity. The company further acknowledges that its periodic workforce restructurings, relocations of headquarters and modernized remote-work policies, while intended to improve cost structure, resource redeployment and talent retention, can be disruptive, temporarily reduce productivity and pose risks to real estate strategy and employee engagement. It also highlights the risk that failure to develop new products in a timely manner, anticipate IT trends, integrate acquired businesses successfully, adapt pricing models, maintain high-quality technical support or compete effectively in evolving delivery and pricing models could impair customer demand, revenues and overall business continuity.

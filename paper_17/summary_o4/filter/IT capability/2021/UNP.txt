The company’s Form 10-K acknowledges that its integrated rail network faces a broad array of internal and external disturbances—including fluctuating customer demand, capacity constraints, severe weather events, cybersecurity incidents, supply-chain disruptions, pandemics, labor disputes, supplier discontinuities and regulatory changes—that can impose pressures on service reliability, operational fluidity, financial condition and liquidity. To absorb strain and preserve functioning under such challenging conditions, management continuously refines its transportation plans, adds capacity, and reallocates resources—such as temporarily increasing crew and locomotive assets—while also deploying multi-faceted safety and risk-management programs that leverage predictive technologies, risk assessments, employee engagement and targeted capital investments. The company dedicates significant capital to information-technology upgrades and cybersecurity defenses, implements fuel surcharge mechanisms to buffer volatility in fuel costs, and maintains liquidity through a receivables facility, revolving credit line, commercial paper and debt issuances based on stress-tested economic scenarios. Its 2022 capital plan of approximately $3.3 billion focuses on infrastructure hardening, intermodal ramp expansions, freight car and locomotive modernization, and efficiency projects designed to reduce variability, improve resource utilization and enhance network resilience. Collectively, these strategic initiatives, resource reconfigurations and contingency arrangements reflect a systemic perspective aimed at enabling the organization to foresee, confront and recover from disruptive change, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

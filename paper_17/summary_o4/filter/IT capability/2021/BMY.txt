Throughout the reporting period, the company demonstrated organizational resilience by deploying comprehensive risk mitigation and business continuity measures across its global operations and supply chain to maintain the integrity and performance of critical functions despite internal and external disturbances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, global logistics stress, natural disasters and geopolitical events. It has maintained open manufacturing sites supported by onsite personnel, implemented phased workforce strategies with vaccination requirements, remote engagement models and enhanced health and safety protocols, and secured inventory continuity through data-sharing agreements with wholesalers and policies limiting channel inventory to one month of demand. The integration of acquired businesses has been managed through the consolidation of manufacturing, operational and administrative systems, aligned pricing and IT infrastructures, and the pursuit of cost savings and synergies to reinforce systemic cohesion and operational flexibility. Robust governance and risk management frameworks – including formal review and certification processes, a dedicated business risk and disclosure function and regularly updated business continuity plans – ensure compliance, oversight and rapid response to emerging threats, while strategic initiatives such as diversified funding strategies, capital structure optimization and share repurchase programs preserve financial flexibility. Portfolio diversification through licensing, acquisitions and divestitures supports adaptability to market access constraints and competitive pressures, and proactive measures in clinical development, supply chain diversification, cybersecurity and asset impairment reviews further equip the organization to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, and sustain performance under challenging conditions, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under adversity.

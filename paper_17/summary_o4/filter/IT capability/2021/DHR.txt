In its “Risk Factors” discussion, the Company acknowledges that its ability to maintain business continuity has been tested by “unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities” during the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to supply-chain constraints, capacity limitations, workforce impacts, unpredictable demand shifts and increased cybersecurity attacks, and it notes that its responses—such as reallocating manufacturing capacity under the U.S. Defense Production Act, activating business continuity plans, expanding production capacity for vaccines, therapeutics and testing, and employing system redundancy and disaster recovery planning—may prove “premature, incorrect or insufficient” and are likely to vary by geography and business line. The report highlights the buffering effect of geographic and industry diversification “to limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country,” the continuous monitoring of competitors and customers to gauge performance and outlook, and significant ongoing investments and acquisitions (including Cytiva and Aldevron) to expand product line diversity, drive technological innovation and enhance operational flexibility under the pressures of market volatility, regulatory change, geopolitical events and natural disasters. It emphasizes the importance of resilient information-technology and data-privacy controls—stating that “significant disruptions in, or breaches in security of, our information technology systems or data … can interrupt our operations”—and outlines extensive environmental, health and safety, and regulatory compliance efforts to mitigate risks of defects, recalls, legal liabilities and reputational harm. Supply-chain resilience measures described include non-cancelable purchase commitments, inter-organizational collaboration with partners and government agencies, and adjustments to manufacturing capacity and inventory management to reflect changing market conditions. Finally, the Company affirms that its liquidity and capital resources—including robust operating cash flow, cash on hand, a committed five-year $5 billion credit facility, commercial paper programs and strategic debt refinancings—are expected to be sufficient to support its operating, investing and financing activities, thereby enabling it “to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.”

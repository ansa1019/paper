The company’s annual report discloses a range of measures and conditions that collectively reflect its efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, and reconfigure operations toward future objectives.  In connection with the acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, the combined entity must integrate a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems, dedicate management attention and resources to align personnel and operations, and realize cost savings and growth opportunities without adversely affecting current revenues or future investments, while acknowledging that anticipated benefits may not materialize or may be delayed.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has modified business practices by restricting travel, changing work locations, shifting many employees to remote work and canceling in-person meetings, events and conferences, yet it notes uncertainty as to whether these measures will fully mitigate workforce, supply chain or facility disruptions and safeguard performance of critical functions.  The report also describes ongoing monitoring of global macroeconomic, political and regulatory pressures—including trade disputes, currency fluctuations, compliance requirements and natural disasters—that could impede production, transportation or customer demand, and it details the use of a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, diversified cash reserves and forecasting processes for accounts receivable and inventory to manage liquidity, support operational flexibility and fund research and development, capital expenditures and dividends.  Periodic restructuring and repositioning actions, such as consolidating facilities, incurring severance and benefit costs, writing off discontinued intellectual property and accelerating equity awards, are undertaken to improve operational effectiveness and realign resources with strategic priorities.  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market with adjustments based on demand forecasts, and long-lived and intangible assets are tested for impairment when changes in circumstances suggest net book value may not be recoverable, underscoring a systemic perspective to maintain integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances.  Through these strategies—encompassing risk assessment, resource reallocation, resilience engineering and dynamic capabilities in financing, innovation and contingency planning—the company seeks to sustain competitive advantage, systemic resilience and evolution in the face of environmental turbulence, uncertainty and disruptive change.

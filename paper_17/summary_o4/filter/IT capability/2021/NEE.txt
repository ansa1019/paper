The report describes numerous organizational capabilities and processes that collectively enable NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries to maintain operational continuity, absorb adversity and adapt performance under variable internal and external conditions. Their extensive federal, state and local regulatory framework and associated cost recovery mechanisms require internal expertise and systemic risk assessment to preserve business continuity and respond effectively to regulatory changes, while reserve amortization and cost‐recovery clauses are deployed to offset storm restoration costs and target regulatory return‐on‐equity under exceptional weather events. The companies employ derivative instruments and hedging procedures, complemented by credit limits, collateral arrangements, insurance programs and capital covenant structures, to mitigate commodity price, interest rate, counterparty and liquidity risks and to safeguard financial integrity during market volatility. Operational flexibility is demonstrated through winterization of critical infrastructure, load‐shedding options and supply chain contingency plans for solar panel acquisitions, as well as through acquisition and integration of FERC‐regulated transmission utilities to diversify asset portfolios. Rigorous asset retirement obligation funding for nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement reflects a proactive strategy for long‐term integrity, while information technology security measures and disaster recovery protocols aim to preserve critical business functions in the face of cyberattacks or natural disasters. Through dynamic capital planning—including shelf registrations, credit facility diversification and targeted share repurchase programs—alongside continuous monitoring of credit ratings and replacement capital covenants, NextEra and FPL seek to reconfigure resources, sustain investment grade status and ensure resilience of operations, governance and performance under challenging conditions.

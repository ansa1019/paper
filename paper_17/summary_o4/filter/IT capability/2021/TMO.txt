Thermo Fisher Scientific has demonstrated its capacity to maintain operations and adapt under challenging conditions by mobilizing in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 response “with products and services that help diagnose the virus as well as assisting customers to develop therapeutics and vaccines used to protect from the virus,” with its life sciences solutions and specialty diagnostics segments “scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic,” and its biosciences and bioproduction businesses “expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they rapidly expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements”; it further strengthened its resilience by assuming operating responsibility of “a new state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Lengnau, Switzerland…with capacity to serve other customers,” while noting that “these measures may disrupt normal business operations and may have significant negative impacts” and that “we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures,” evidencing preparedness for health-related and other unexpected disruptions. To address supply-chain vulnerabilities the company recognizes that “our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies” and undertakes qualification of replacement sources, and it has invested in information technology by “periodically implement[ing] new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications” with disaster recovery planning—although “such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner” and “our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.” The company also prepares for natural disasters and geopolitical events—acknowledging that “an earthquake or other natural disaster such as a fire or hurricane or power shortages or outages could disrupt our operations or impair our critical systems” and that “these types of events could negatively impact customer spending”—and maintains robust liquidity, noting its belief that “its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future.” In support of strategic resilience, it allocates research and development funding “to products with higher growth prospects,” pursues geographic expansion and commercial infrastructure enhancements, executes continuous productivity improvements through its Practical Process Improvement system—including “continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities”—and integrates acquisitions while managing operational continuity, all reflecting the maintenance of performance and positive adjustment under adversity.

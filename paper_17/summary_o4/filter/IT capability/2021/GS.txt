The Firm maintains comprehensive resiliency plans and business continuity frameworks designed to preserve or improve functioning in the face of operational disruptions, whether nominal, extreme or exceptional, by pre‐funding potential cash and collateral needs through a diversified global core liquid assets portfolio, holding significant unencumbered assets, and maintaining a contingency funding plan to respond to liquidity stress; it continuously updates and diversifies its systems, technology infrastructure and vendor arrangements, invests in systemic controls, training and independent price verification, and imposes risk limits and automated monitoring to manage market, credit, operational and model risks; firmwide and business‐level stress tests and scenario analyses, including one‐day and long‐term severely adverse scenarios, inform dynamic balance‐sheet planning, capital planning and resolution planning to ensure sufficient capital, liquidity and funding under acute or protracted stress, and enable rapid reconfiguration of balance‐sheet exposures while safeguarding system integrity, mitigating errors and malfeasance, and supporting timely settlement and operational flexibility even in a difficult funding environment.

The Company acknowledges that its results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters, including pandemics and cyber-attacks, and notes that it attempts to manage its exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls, risk models, purchase of third-party reinsurance, and geographic diversification. It cannot predict the impact of changing climate conditions, legal or regulatory responses, or the continuous evolution of cyber perils engineered by human actors to evade established loss mitigation controls. To protect its employees and support operational continuity under pandemic-related restrictions, much of the workforce may be working remotely, placing increased demands on IT systems, while the Company maintains that credit facilities, a substantial cash balance, highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income portfolios of relatively short duration, and dedicated liquidity tools such as repurchase agreements and syndicated letter of credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands. The Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses, evaluates loss development patterns and forward-looking stress tests, assesses reserves for long-duration contracts subject to adverse deviation, and applies critical accounting estimates that require considerable judgment. It actively monitors catastrophe, terrorism, political, credit and climate risks using internally and externally generated modeling, stress testing and scenario analysis to ensure sufficient capital, maintain adequate coverage structures and optimize resource allocation, and it seeks to maintain underwriting discipline by writing only those policies which adequately compensate for risk. The firm operates through a profit center structure that affords operational flexibility, decentralized decision-making and strategic agility, and leverages product and geographic diversification as a source of stability during periods of volatility. Furthermore, it implements multilayered risk management strategies including quota share and excess of loss protection, collateralized reinsurance trusts, country and credit risk limits, and periodic reviews of exposure accumulations, while also pursuing acquisitions, share repurchases and capital initiatives to sustain long-term growth in book value and preserve system integrity under internal or external variations and disturbances.

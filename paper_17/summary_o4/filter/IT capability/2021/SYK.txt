The Company reports that it has experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant and unpredictable need to adjust its operations as market demand for certain products has shifted or as mandated by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including suspension or reduction of elective medical procedures, accelerated development and production efforts to address medical and other requirements, and mitigation measures such as travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. Management acknowledges that the pandemic and related measures have disrupted its workforce and the workforce of third-party suppliers, manufacturers and distributors, leading to tightening labor markets, retention challenges, increased wages, voluntary attrition and potential delays or suspensions in manufacturing, sales, research, product development, clinical programs and other corporate functions. The Company has taken steps to mitigate these effects, including business continuity planning, adjustments to operating expenses, potential suspension of dividends, strategic resource allocation across capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, and the use of debt and existing credit facilities to supplement operating cash flows. Its global cash management strategy, strong investment-grade short- and long-term debt ratings and liquidity sources—cash from operations, commercial paper and credit lines—are intended to support short-term liquidity and operating needs, while cash held outside the United States is earmarked for organic expansion and acquisitions. The Company also maintains third-party insurance and a wholly owned captive insurer to manage property and casualty exposures and self-insured liabilities. Recognizing risks inherent in extensive global operations—transportation disruptions, raw material and component shortages, regulatory changes, intellectual property considerations, pricing pressures and cybersecurity threats—the Company invests in monitoring, employee training and security policies and deploys business continuity plans to preserve system integrity and performance under internal or external variations. The ongoing implementation of a new global ERP system, efforts to secure key information technology systems, and continual review of risk management, supply chain resilience and corporate responsibility initiatives reflect the Company’s focus on maintaining operations, adapting to environmental perturbations and preserving its integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

Netflixâ€™s organizational resilience is reflected in its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid internal and external variations and disturbances, such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which has disrupted its business, increased costs and led to delays in content releases, prompting the company to actively monitor evolving health and safety protocols and alter business operations to maintain service continuity. The company scales its streaming service and content production globally, developing technology, utilizing third-party cloud computing services and deploying its proprietary content delivery network to preserve performance and integrity under variable demand and technical disruptions. By expanding interdisciplinary expertise across creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing and merchandising disciplines, managing and adjusting content offerings to diverse consumer customs and regulatory environments, and refining corporate culture, systems and operational practices, Netflix adapts to rapid market changes, competitive pressures and evolving customer needs. It implements risk assessment and mitigation processes for cybersecurity threats, payment processing, intellectual property and legal proceedings, relying on robust systems and processes to thwart unauthorized access and ensure data security. The company also regularly adjusts membership pricing, plans and service features, engages in strategic partnerships and marketing initiatives, and leverages its recommendation and merchandising technologies to maintain customer engagement and sustainable growth while protecting its reputation and financial performance under challenging conditions.

NVIDIA has revised its process for purchasing supply as a result of worldwide supply shortages impacting the semiconductor industry, placing non-cancellable inventory orders in advance of its historical lead times, paying premiums and providing deposits to secure future supply and capacity, and building finished products and carrying inventory for anticipated demand to shorten shipment lead times. Recognizing its manufacturing lead times in some cases extend to twelve months or longer, NVIDIA makes estimates of customers’ future demand, which could give rise to product shortages or excess inventory and increase the uncertainty of demand forecasting. To address potential mismatches between supply and demand and to manage resource deployment, NVIDIA writes down its inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess quantities when estimates of future demand decline. Climate change, extreme weather events and the risk of power safety shut-offs in northern California due to wildfire risk are acknowledged as having adverse implications for its headquarters and data centers, potentially impairing employees’ ability to work effectively, which the company seeks to mitigate through insurance coverage and resilience planning. The company further recognizes that climate-related disruptions to its supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and political instability could disrupt operations and require losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. NVIDIA depends on third parties to manufacture, assemble, test, package and design its products, reducing its control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules, and faces risks that events such as natural disasters, war, pandemics or cyber-attacks could disrupt its worldwide operations, damage customer relationships, and require substantial expenditures and time to fully resume operations. Upon security incidents, NVIDIA engages in remedial and preventative actions, rotates network credentials, hardens its network, analyzes exfiltrated information, and notifies law enforcement to mitigate risks and support recovery. The company has modified its business and workforce practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote work, limited travel and incremental on-site expenses as offices reopen, while continuing to monitor pandemic-related disruptions to supply chain, logistical services and component availability. NVIDIA relies upon internal processes and information systems, including implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, to support key business functions and scalability, recognizing any programming errors or control failures could impact its ability to operate and report financial results. Succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees are deemed essential to maintaining strategic planning and execution. Investments in acquisitions and strategic initiatives involve diversion of capital and management’s attention and integration challenges that, if not managed effectively, could impair the company’s ability to absorb shocks and maintain performance. NVIDIA continuously assesses its resilience to evolving regulatory, geopolitical and market pressures—including trade restrictions, export controls, antitrust enforcement, data privacy laws and climate-related requirements—acknowledging that changes could increase compliance costs, restrict operations or require strategic adaptation to preserve organizational health and performance under adverse conditions.

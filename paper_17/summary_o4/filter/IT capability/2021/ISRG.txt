Our risk disclosures describe the impact of public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on business continuity and operational flexibility, including restrictions on travel, temporary facility closures, supply-chain interruptions, diverted hospital resources, and shifts to remote and hybrid work that have increased operational risk, cyber vulnerabilities, and office-space uncertainties. We highlight our reliance on key sole-source suppliers and the associated risks of disruption or termination, which could necessitate extensive quality-verification processes, higher costs, and manufacturing delays, and describe mitigation activities such as enhanced supplier communication, adjustments to purchase-order coverage, and increased inventory levels. We discuss credit and lease financing risks arising from customer deferrals or defaults and note our customer relief program, which provided service-fee credits, lease-payment deferrals, and extended payment terms to maintain program continuity and support customers. We outline the potential effects of geopolitical, regulatory, and environmental crises—including tariffs, export restrictions, government shutdowns, and natural disasters—on our manufacturing, regulatory approvals, and import/export channels, and the corresponding need for strategic supplier diversification and distribution modifications. We also address threats to our information systems from cybersecurity incidents and data breaches, emphasizing ongoing investments in network security, data encryption, and incident response protocols. Collectively, these disclosures reflect our deliberate approach to risk management, resource reallocation, and strategic adaptation designed to preserve operational integrity, mitigate disruptions, and maintain performance under challenging and variable conditions.

Berkshire Hathaway has taken steps intended to mitigate cyber-security and other operational risks, including “business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis” to limit service interruptions and security events. It “manages its operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis” and relies on “outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units” alongside a board-approved succession plan to address key person dependencies and ensure continuity of capital allocation and investment decisions. The company emphasizes that “financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire,” maintains substantial cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bill balances with a self-imposed $30 billion floor for repurchases, and “insists on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments” to provide a margin of safety against market volatility. To support the integrity of core infrastructure, it “requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided on a timely basis” and similarly allocates capital for utilities and energy assets. In its insurance operations, disciplined underwriting practices are employed “to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations,” recognizing that “the timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility” in results. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including “upstream supply chain constraints” that “adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies,” has led to resource reallocation, increased hiring and wage costs, and ongoing cost control, even as management concedes it “cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our operations will completely normalize.” These policies reflect the company’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to adversity and preserve or improve functioning across challenging conditions.

Throughout the risk factor disclosures, management acknowledges that “a manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties … could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business and operations,” underscoring the imperative to maintain continuity and positive adjustment under adverse and unpredictable circumstances. In response to the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has implemented adaptive forecasting and production measures for Veklury to address fluctuating infection, hospitalization and vaccination rates, established contingency protocols to mitigate global supply chain disruptions arising from quarantines, travel restrictions and raw‐material shortages, and reconfigured manufacturing volumes to prevent both shortages and excess inventory. Clinical resilience has been reinforced by modifying trial protocols, managing participant compliance challenges and FDA-imposed holds, and by prioritizing R&D activities through a process in which “we manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of technical and regulatory successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations.” Financial and regulatory adaptability is supported through foreign‐currency hedging strategies, a revolving credit facility for working capital and disciplined impairment reviews of both finite‐ and indefinite‐lived intangible assets linked to milestone achievements and regulatory approvals. Employee and organizational health measures—including enhanced safety protocols, remote‐work flexibilities, health screenings and vaccine requirements—have been deployed to preserve morale and productivity, while strategic collaborations and a diversified network of third-party manufacturing partners reinforce operational flexibility and system resilience. Finally, rigorous accruals for legal contingencies, robust cybersecurity protocols and comprehensive compliance frameworks further strengthen the Company’s capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and maintain integrity and performance across nominal, extreme and exceptional conditions.

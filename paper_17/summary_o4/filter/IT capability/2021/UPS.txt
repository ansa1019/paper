UPS’s disclosures highlight the organization’s exposure to and management of a broad spectrum of internal and external pressures to preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions. The company notes that its business, financial condition and results of operations “are and will remain subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,” including the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations, financial performance, customer liquidity and workforce deployment; “the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences remain uncertain, are changing and difficult to predict,” underscoring the challenge of maintaining continuity and operational flexibility. UPS identifies “supply chain disruptions,” severe weather events, natural or man-made disasters and evolving regulatory and security requirements as potential sources of business interruption and reputational risk, and it has “invested and expect[s] to continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans” to bolster system integrity and support rapid response to cyber-attacks and other disruptions. Recognizing climate change as a source of “financial and operational risks,” UPS commits significant resources to emissions-reduction goals, asset remediation and the development of alternative fuels, while acknowledging that technological advances and regulatory outcomes may affect its cost structure and competitive position. To enhance resilience, the company maintains ample liquidity through cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, commercial paper programs and committed credit facilities, “regularly evaluates opportunities to optimize our capital structure” and executes disciplined capital allocation—including divestitures such as the sale of UPS Freight to reallocate resources and strengthen financial flexibility. UPS further mitigates commodity and currency exposures through fuel surcharges, hedging transactions and active management of interest-rate and foreign-exchange risk. Human and organizational resilience is addressed through workforce planning, benefits and pension management—where “changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor” are recognized immediately to manage volatility—and through self-insurance programs based on actuarial estimates that “incorporate actual loss experience and judgments about expected future development” to absorb liability and preserve organizational health. Continuous process and strategy reviews, including enhancements to revenue quality, cost-to-serve and technology-driven automation, illustrate UPS’s systemic approach to preserving integrity and performance—at least partially—while under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

Our filings disclose that “our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, such as anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, competition, money transfer services, privacy and sanctions, and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve,” that we “maintain and regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met,” and that we “indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses they may suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules.” To safeguard our operating integrity, we operate “a business continuity program” under which we seek to “successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets, and data” following errors, interruptions or damage; we also “devote significant resources to our cybersecurity, acquired entities, and supplier risk management programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents.” Our treasury policies “provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives,” ensuring “adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; timely completion of payments settlement activities; payments on required litigation settlements; planned capital investments in our business; and investment of excess cash in securities” while limiting credit exposure “to any one financial institution or type of investment.” Consistent with these policies, we maintain “a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes,” an unsecured $5.0 billion revolving credit facility, and a litigation escrow account under our U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. We “expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives,” and during the COVID-19 pandemic “are taking a phased approach to reopening our offices, with most of our employees currently working remotely,” reflecting our adaptive measures to preserve functionality and performance under challenging conditions.

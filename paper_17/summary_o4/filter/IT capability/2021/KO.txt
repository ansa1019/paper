Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and related business disruptions, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical, and we have developed system-wide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, which include the management of any supply-chain challenges. Our priorities have been ensuring the health and safety of our employees; supporting and making a difference in the communities we serve; keeping our brands in supply; maintaining the quality and safety of our products; and serving our customers across all channels as they adapt to shifting demands. Although the pandemic has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our global supply chain—causing temporary plant closures, production slowdowns and delays in sourcing key ingredients and beverage containers—we have contingency plans in place, expect supply-chain pressures to continue into 2022 and remain flexible to adjust to uncertainties arising from new variants, government actions and evolving consumer behavior. We expect to continue to see improvements in our business as we learn and adapt to the ever-changing environment and proactively pursue productivity initiatives and reinvestment programs while managing potential distractions, employee morale impacts and internal control challenges. Our ability to evolve and improve our existing products through innovation, to develop and market new products that reflect changing consumer preferences, and to selectively expand into other profitable categories is central to our capacity to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform in order to emerge stronger. We are accelerating our digital transformation—creating personalized consumer experiences, building more powerful digital tools for our retail customers and digitizing operations through data, artificial intelligence, automation and robotics—to increase operational flexibility and competitive advantage. We continue to strengthen our enterprise information systems and our cybersecurity, privacy and incident-response capabilities through investments in personnel, technology and training, supported by an information-risk management program and regular reporting to senior management and the audit committee, to protect against service interruptions, data breaches or other incidents that could impair our ability to manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments. We also bolster our financial resilience by managing working capital, leveraging supply-chain finance programs, maintaining undrawn credit lines, actively balancing short- and long-term debt and pursuing strategic realignment initiatives, acquisitions, refranchising and divestitures to preserve liquidity and support our capacity to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, and maintain performance under pressure.

The company discloses a comprehensive risk management and business continuity framework intended to preserve its integrity and performance when faced with internal or external disturbances, ranging from patent or competitive pressures and economic uncertainty to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and cyber-attacks. It maintains diversified funding sources—including cash, cash equivalents, commercial paper, a $6 billion committed credit facility and periodic issuances of long-term notes—to ensure liquidity for operational continuity, R&D investment, strategic acquisitions and return of capital to shareholders. The report details the use of hedging programs and derivative instruments to mitigate foreign-exchange and interest-rate volatility, regular monitoring and estimation of provisions for chargebacks, rebates and product returns to protect cash flows, and establishment of inventory-level controls and buy-back incentives for wholesalers to prevent channel overstock and maintain customer service levels. Organizational flexibility is further supported by global restructuring programs, accelerated depreciation and facility closures to optimize manufacturing capacity and by agreements with public health agencies and third parties to expand vaccine and antiviral production in response to the COVID-19 emergency. The company also describes ongoing efforts to enhance cyber-resiliency—including modernizing systems, improving recovery speed and sustaining critical operations during network attacks—and to accrue for environmental, legal, tax and other contingent liabilities in order to absorb strain and adapt rapidly to unexpected situations, while maintaining strategic foresight through ongoing scenario planning, dynamic capital allocation and reinforcement of its financial and operational foundations.

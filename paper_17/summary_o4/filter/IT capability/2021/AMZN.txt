These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations, and the events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price; the variability in our retail business places increased strain on our operations as demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events, and failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth; when we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs; if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders; in addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand; failures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business; as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively; failure to optimize inventory or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments; we seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services, and we regularly evaluate our facility requirements; we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches because we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, and failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors' or customers' technology, products, and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action, deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services, and otherwise harm our business and reputation; our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient; we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties; any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability; we depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our president and CEO, and competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate has historically been intense; the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business; decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises), or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all; under our commercial agreements and strategic alliances, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services to businesses, and these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service; we may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, and we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services; we have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and these transactions create risks such as disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; problems retaining key personnel; additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired; the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill; and the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell, but demand for products can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale; we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes; we seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies; steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results; we use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, and some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented; our expansion places a significant strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources, and failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results; we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate and disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters or extreme weather or geopolitical events could disrupt our operations; we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers, and an inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience; we believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers; we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, our mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers; we believe that our model enables us to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle, generally collecting from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due; we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months; and we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position, although there can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

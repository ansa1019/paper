The annual report discloses that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and may continue to impact us in the future through delayed, reduced or cancelled customer orders; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; the inability of our customers or licensees to purchase or pay for our products or technologies; insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; workforce illness or quarantine; and challenges in safely reopening our offices, which could expose employees, customers, licensees and partners to health risks and associated liability and cause operational disruptions. We explain that the degree to which the pandemic impacts our future business, results of operations and financial condition depends on uncertain developments such as its duration, spread and severity; the availability, adoption and efficacy of vaccines; emergence and characteristics of new variants; government responses and other mitigation measures; and the timing and extent of the resumption of normal business and social activity, as well as the extent to which it affects our customers, licensees, suppliers and other partners and exacerbates other operational risks. We note that our revenues are significantly concentrated among a small number of customers and licensees, and that the concentration of device share and corresponding purchasing power of these companies may result in lower prices, revenue fluctuations and reduced cash resources for other purposes, particularly if our customers vertically integrate or adopt competitors’ products, or if political or trade policies limit our ability to transact with key customers or suppliers. We acknowledge that our growth depends on extending our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas and industries beyond mobile handsets—an endeavor requiring substantial resource allocation, research and development investments, transitions to new business models and organizational transformations, as well as the recruitment, retention and motivation of specialized engineering and technical personnel in a highly competitive market and under evolving hybrid working practices that may impair our collaborative and innovative culture. We describe our strategic use of acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions to open or expand opportunities for our products and technologies, while recognizing that integration efforts involve complex challenges—retaining key employees, consolidating operations and systems, achieving anticipated synergies and securing regulatory approvals—and carry the risk of impairment charges, litigation and financing obligations. We further emphasize our reliance on a limited number of third-party suppliers in a fabless production model for manufacturing, assembly, testing and raw-material procurement, and we warn that failure to execute supply strategies that ensure supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins—such as securing multi-year capacity commitments—could result in supply interruptions or delays, increased costs, sole-source vulnerabilities, lost sales opportunities, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, higher fixed costs relative to demand, excess or obsolete inventory and harm to customer relationships. We identify additional risks to our manufacturing operations, including environmental, health, safety and cyber-attack exposures; impacts of climate change; natural disasters; geopolitical conflicts; and compliance with evolving environmental and climate-change laws, all of which could disrupt operations, delay production and increase compliance expenditures or liabilities. We caution that our demand forecasting processes, based on assumptions and estimates, may lead to overestimation of demand and result in higher inventory carrying costs or excess inventory. We disclose that third parties regularly attempt unauthorized access to our information technology systems and that, despite our robust cybersecurity measures aligned with international frameworks, we may not anticipate, detect, repel or implement effective preventive measures against all evolving threats, and any breach could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our technology, intellectual property or proprietary information. We observe that our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and manage a hybrid working environment without impairing productivity, collaboration and innovation. We describe our reliance on patent, copyright, trademark and trade-secret laws, confidentiality agreements and international treaties to protect our intellectual property and our exposure to enforcement challenges, changes in patent law, adverse rulings in governmental investigations, competition-law challenges and efforts by OEMs or standards bodies to limit or devalue royalty commitments, any of which could harm our competitive position, licensing revenues and ability to enforce our patents. We explain that changes in our patent-licensing practices—such as requiring licenses to chipset manufacturers or selling chipsets to unlicensed OEMs—could increase transaction costs, delay revenue recognition and reduce aggregated revenues. We underline the complexity and evolving nature of regulations affecting patent licensing, competition, trade, environmental compliance, cybersecurity, data protection, taxation and other areas, noting that compliance efforts may divert management attention and increase costs or restrict operations, and that noncompliance may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, we recognize that operating in the highly cyclical, capital-intensive semiconductor industry—subject to rapid technological change, price erosion, capacity constraints, market volatility, economic downturns, trade tensions and regulatory actions—requires the maintenance of financial, human and operational resources to absorb strain, preserve functioning and, where possible, improve our performance under challenging and uncertain conditions.

UnitedHealth Group maintains business continuation and resiliency plans that are maintained, updated and tested regularly in an effort to contain and remediate potential disruptions or cyber events and mitigate operational interruptions, delays or cessation of service. The company acknowledges a reliance on the integrity and timeliness of the data it uses to serve members, operate the business and deploy new services, and commits significant development and operational resources to consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand its information systems—including AI/ML-powered technologies—while managing cyber-security risks through programs to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and training employees on phishing, malware and other threats, despite evolving techniques used by threat actors and vulnerabilities arising from remote operations and third-party dependencies. Medical cost risk is managed through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs, and benefit, network and premium adjustments are employed to offset funding pressures arising from regulatory rate changes, pandemics, public health crises and large-scale emergencies. In strategic transactions, the company emphasizes the integration of acquired businesses into its existing operations and internal control environment to preserve or enhance system integrity and performance amid external variations, supporting the organization’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt to challenging conditions and maintain functioning and financial stability.

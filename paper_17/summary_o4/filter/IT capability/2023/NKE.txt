Nike’s Annual Report discloses multiple measures that support organizational resilience as defined by Vogus & Sutcliffe, including business continuity and disaster recovery planning across its globally diversified operations, as well as substantial investments in information technology systems—encompassing demand and supply planning, inventory control, digital commerce platforms and enterprise resource planning—to maintain system integrity and operational flexibility in the face of disruptions such as pandemics, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, facility closures, labor shortages, transportation delays and fluctuations in foreign currency rates. The company manages risk through foreign exchange hedging, diversification of manufacturing locations and a factory currency exposure index, coupled with strategic resource allocation to absorb inflationary input, freight and logistics costs, and by leveraging data analytics and digital transformation to sense demand, reconfigure supply chains and sustain performance under pressure. Nike further emphasizes its reliance on a robust global distribution network, contract manufacturer oversight, emergency management protocols and capital commitments to adapt to environmental perturbations, ensure operational continuity, mitigate external pressures and reconstitute trajectories toward long-term growth, demonstrating a systemic perspective on preserving or improving functioning despite adversity.

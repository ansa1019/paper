Gilead acknowledges that actual or threatened outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases may significantly disrupt its global operations, including supply chain and logistics constraints, increased operating expenses, lower demand, challenges to employee safety and interruptions to clinical trials or patient access; in response, the company maintains business continuity plans and contingencies and conducts periodic natural disaster risk assessments as part of its enterprise risk management program. It hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures through contracts to mitigate financial volatility and relies on cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and a revolving credit facility, supplemented by operating cash flows, to ensure adequate funding for capital needs. The company recognizes that its extensive outsourcing of clinical trial activities to third-party contract research organizations and reliance on third-party manufacturers and corporate partners for active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug product manufacturing expose it to risks of delays, quality issues, lot failures, inventory shortages, regulatory GMP inspections, product withdrawals or recalls, and potential disruptions from natural disasters, equipment failures or other difficulties at single-source facilities. To support long-term growth and respond to uncertainties, Gilead manages research and development expenses by identifying planned activities, prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of technical and regulatory success, market potential and resource availability, and reallocating resources among internal and external portfolios as needed. The company also invests in enterprise resource planning and information systems, including the Kite Konnect platform, and recognizes that failures, delays or cybersecurity incidents in these systems could impair manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, financial reporting and patient safety.

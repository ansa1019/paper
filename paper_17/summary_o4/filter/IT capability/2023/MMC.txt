The company discloses that its inability to successfully recover should it experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability; that if it experiences a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event—such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, war or geopolitical tensions, protests or riots, security breach, cyberattack (including manipulation of control systems of critical infrastructure), power loss or telecommunications failure—its ability to operate will depend, in part, on the continued availability of its personnel, office facilities and the proper functioning of its computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations; that disruptions may result in data loss, data unavailability, data corruption or other damage to information technology systems; that a cyberattack or other business continuity event affecting the company or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption of its information technology systems or operations or its ability to recover data, requiring it to incur significant expense to address and remediate such issues; and that an extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and, in the worst case, manipulation of critical infrastructure control systems could result in loss of life.  The company states that its operations depend on its ability to protect its technology infrastructure against damage and on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information; that these risks have increased significantly due to hybrid and remote work environments; that it regularly assesses and takes steps to improve its existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession; that a disaster or continuity event on a significant scale, or its inability to recover successfully from such an event, could materially interrupt business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships and legal liability; and that its business disruption insurance may not fully cover, in type or amount, the cost of a successful recovery.  The company further warns that its business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if it fails to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change such as AI, and that failure to keep up with technological changes or execute effectively on its strategic initiatives could adversely impact its business and results of operations.

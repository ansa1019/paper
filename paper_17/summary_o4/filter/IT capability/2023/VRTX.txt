The Company recognizes that its organizational resilience may be challenged by a range of potential disruptions—regulatory changes in healthcare laws and pricing reforms, geopolitical and environmental perturbations, third-party manufacturing or logistics failures, cybersecurity breaches, and delays or suspensions in clinical trials—which could materially interrupt business continuity, resource allocation and operational flexibility. To mitigate these risks, management has implemented security measures and a business continuity plan, diversified supplier relationships and developed contingency strategies with contract research organizations and logistics providers, while maintaining corporate compliance programs and inter-organizational collaboration frameworks to preserve system integrity and absorptive capacity. At the same time, the organization faces integration challenges and contingent consideration liabilities from acquisitions, restrictive financial covenants that limit strategic adaptation, and variability in quarterly operating results driven by fluctuating net product revenues and R&D investments, underscoring the need for ongoing risk assessment, stakeholder engagement, adaptive strategies and strategic agility to maintain functioning and emerge stronger under adverse conditions.

The company’s significant global operations expose it to additional risks and any adverse event—such as war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, as well as natural or man-made disasters including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease—could materially interrupt its facilities, supply chain and ability to manufacture, develop or distribute products; climate change’s acute and chronic risks, including extreme weather conditions, inland flooding and sea-level rise, as well as transitional risks such as new carbon pricing regimes, regulatory requirements, changes in technology and market risk, may disrupt operations, require facility upgrades, and impose increased costs for resilience; reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements for critical development, manufacturing and distribution activities increases the company’s exposure to vendor non-performance and requires continuous monitoring, risk assessment and contingency planning to preserve operational continuity; the company’s dependence on sophisticated software applications, complex IT systems and cloud-based providers creates cyber-attack and data-security vulnerabilities that threaten its manufacturing, research and sales operations despite ongoing efforts to strengthen defenses, conduct impact assessments and reconfigure IT infrastructure; sustained pricing pressures worldwide—from government cost-containment measures, managed care negotiations and pending drug price-setting under the Inflation Reduction Act—demand strategic resource allocation, dynamic capability for negotiating rebates and discounts, and adaptable commercial practices to maintain profitability; evolving and complex legal, regulatory and ESG requirements, including climate-related disclosure mandates, ESG reporting directives, intellectual property law changes and data privacy regulations, necessitate sustained investments in compliance, inter-organizational collaboration and governance mechanisms to mitigate compliance failures; competitive pressures from lower-cost generics and biosimilars, unpredictable economic conditions, currency fluctuations and disruptions in emerging markets compel the company to continuously deploy resources for research and development, diversify its product pipeline, and maintain a flow of successful new products to offset revenue losses from patent expirations; and challenges in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel underscore the importance of organizational flexibility, strategic planning and adaptive leadership to ensure business continuity, mitigate risks of fragmentation and sustain performance under internal or external disturbances.

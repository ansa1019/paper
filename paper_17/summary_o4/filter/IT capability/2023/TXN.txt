The Company’s disclosures highlight its susceptibility to macroeconomic downturns, volatility in general market conditions, geopolitical tensions and political, social, economic, security and public health disruptions across more than 30 countries, including risks to manufacturing capacity, power, water, transportation, communications and information technology networks, which may impact its ability to deliver products, support customers, receive manufacturing equipment or source alternate suppliers; it faces substantial competition requiring rapid response to product development and pricing pressures, necessitating agility in product innovation and cost structures; it undertakes strategic, business and organizational changes—including acquisitions, divestitures, capital investments and restructuring—to support its objectives and acknowledges that failure to implement these changes successfully could adversely affect its business plans and operating results; climate change is identified as exacerbating natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt its manufacturing and design operations; reliance on third parties for goods, services and advanced manufacturing process technology exposes it to supply chain risks from quality excursions, political or economic instability, natural events or epidemics and limited access to key materials and utilities; significant investments in research and development and capital expenditures are made to improve existing technology, develop new products to meet changing customer demands and strengthen manufacturing capacity, although returns on these investments may not be realized until commercial viability is assured; the Company warns that cybersecurity events could compromise its networks, result in data loss or unauthorized release of proprietary information and disrupt manufacturing and other operations; its manufacturing forecasts, based on multiple assumptions, may result in inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce its profit margins; and its primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations, supplemented by cash, short-term investments and an undrawn revolving credit facility, with management expressing confidence that it has the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next twelve months.

Mastercard identifies information security and operational resilience as critical components of its business continuity framework, noting that cyber‐attacks, human error, software or hardware failures, supply‐chain attacks, natural disasters (including climate-related events), power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence and other catastrophic events may interrupt its transaction switching systems and third-party networks, damage its reputation, increase costs and cause losses. The company employs a multi-layered approach to protect digital technologies, computer systems and customer information, and maintains an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies to preserve system integrity, maintain performance and ensure operational continuity under adverse conditions. Mastercard acknowledges that inadequate infrastructure in emerging markets or failures by service providers to meet capacity requirements could compromise its ability to transmit information globally, materially reduce operational resilience and invite regulatory intervention in the event of prolonged service outages. While it offers cyber and intelligence solutions to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and security incidents and maintains insurance coverage, the company recognizes that evolving threats and vulnerabilities—both in its own systems and those of third parties—require ongoing investments in protective measures, remediation of vulnerabilities and development of robust recovery mechanisms to sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The Annual Report discloses that the company’s business continuity plans and other safeguards may not fully mitigate the operational impacts of natural disasters, pandemics, credit market disruptions or geopolitical conflicts, including supply chain interruptions, regulatory constraints, third‐party distribution or manufacturing failures and currency controls, which could delay production, shipments and revenue, impair compliance management and constrain its ability to meet customer demand. It continuously monitors and assesses risk factors, deploying cybersecurity and third‐party cybersecurity risk management programs, environmental goals and supplier standards to address climate change, biodiversity loss and extreme weather events potentially affecting raw material quality and volume, and maintains ongoing evaluation of defenses to reduce security incidents. In response to the war in Ukraine, it has scaled down investments where necessary, sustained commercial activities where safe, invested in alternate production capacity in western Ukraine, assessed evolving Russian regulatory constraints and developed contingency plans to preserve operations. The company acknowledges the inherent unpredictability of geopolitical, regulatory and macroeconomic developments—including decisions by authorities such as the WHO, FCTC or FDA, shifts in tax regimes, and fluctuations in consumer behaviors—and confirms that, notwithstanding prudent planning and forward‐looking statements, it cannot predict or identify all risk factors, yet seeks to adapt resource allocation, organizational design and compliance mechanisms to sustain functioning and performance under challenging conditions.

Boston Scientific’s disclosures reflect an ongoing commitment to maintaining business continuity and organizational resilience by identifying and mitigating risks from economic volatility, supply chain disruptions, public health crises, regulatory changes and cybersecurity threats. The company notes that challenging domestic and international economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, interest‐rate fluctuations, sovereign debt issues and foreign currency volatility, could adversely impact its customers, suppliers and vendors, potentially interrupting the supply of materials and components, while global pandemics such as COVID-19 have demonstrated the need for operational flexibility to respond to site shutdowns, labor-market disruptions and limited provider capacity. To enhance resilience, management has instituted a global supply chain optimization strategy and approved a 2023 restructuring plan to simplify manufacturing and distribution networks, transfer production lines among facilities, expand efficiencies and resiliency across production, sterilization and distribution, and optimize functional capabilities to support business growth, with anticipated savings reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Financial resilience measures include accounts receivable factoring programs, a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility, diversified cash management policies and disciplined leverage and liquidity planning, while ongoing efforts to integrate acquisitions, maintain robust IT and OT systems, strengthen incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, and adapt to evolving regulatory regimes such as the EU MDR and privacy laws are portrayed as critical to absorbing strain and preserving the integrity and performance of operations under internal and external pressures. Moreover, the company recognizes that climate change, environmental regulation, corporate social responsibility and sustainability considerations may affect the availability and cost of inputs and underscores its proactive approach to climate risk management, resource reconfiguration and strategic foresight in order to preserve or improve functioning under adversity.

KKR’s annual report highlights that its ability to sustain operations and adapt under stress depends critically on business‐continuity measures and risk‐mitigation frameworks that, while implemented to address market volatility, geopolitical upheavals, natural catastrophes, pandemics, terrorist acts, cyber-security breaches, and third-party service outages, cannot be assured of fully preserving its functioning or performance, and acknowledges that its disaster-recovery and operational-continuity programs may be insufficient to avert material disruptions. The firm notes its exposure to unexpected events—from disruptions to its New York headquarters to failures by counterparties, administrators or technology providers—and the resulting need to allocate resources, reconfigure operations, and deploy hedging and insurance strategies, yet concedes it cannot control or predict many external pressures. Moreover, KKR recognizes that its competitive advantage and resilience rest on the retention, skills and coordination of its employees, the integrity of its third-party networks, effective crisis response and regulatory navigation, and that any failure in these areas, combined with complex inter-organizational relationships, may impinge on its operational flexibility, capacity to recover from adverse conditions and maintenance of core business objectives.

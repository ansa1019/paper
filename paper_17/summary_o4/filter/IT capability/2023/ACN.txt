In its annual report, Accenture identifies that its business is subject to general risks and uncertainties, including volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions which have in the past undermined, and could in the future undermine, business confidence and cause clients to reduce or defer spending, challenging the company’s ability to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build revenue and resource plans. The company emphasizes that its success depends in part on its ability to anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings—such as digital, cloud, security-related offerings and developments in AI including generative AI—to serve evolving client needs and maintain a competitive advantage, while acknowledging that failure to sufficiently invest and innovate could materially affect its results of operations. Accenture reports applying AI to its services, client delivery methods and internal operations to enhance its adaptability and service innovation. The report describes workforce management actions—including hiring, reskilling, redeployment of existing people, engagement of subcontractors and, when necessary, involuntary terminations and business optimization actions—to keep its supply of people and skills in balance with client demand and control costs under changing demand patterns and global delivery requirements. Recognizing the criticality of information technology networks and systems, the company highlights exposure to security incidents, cyberattacks, disruptions of utilities or cloud services, and other system failures which could affect its or its clients' operations, and notes reliance on business continuity and disaster recovery plans, insurance, and compliance with privacy and cybersecurity laws such as GDPR to mitigate operational and reputational risks. Accenture also describes risks associated with geographic concentration of its delivery capability—particularly in India and the Philippines—and potential constraints from local regulations and geopolitical tensions, which may impair operational flexibility and efficiency. The firm reports that its strategy includes strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance skills and capabilities, while acknowledging challenges in integrating acquired businesses, assimilating employees into its culture, and diverting management attention. To manage financial resilience, Accenture discusses cost-management strategies, pricing adjustments, hedging programs to partially offset currency translation effects, and tax planning to preserve margins and sustainable growth under internal and external financial pressures. These disclosures collectively illustrate measures to absorb strain, preserve functioning and maintain performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions in line with the concept of organizational resilience.

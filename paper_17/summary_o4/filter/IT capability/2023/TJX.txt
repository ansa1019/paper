In its risk disclosures, the company warns that “failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and successfully manage our inventory could adversely affect our results,” noting that key elements of its off-price business model—opportunistic buying, lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns—“place considerable discretion with our merchants,” who “are expected to effectively react to rapidly changing opportunities and trends in the market, to assess the desirability and value of merchandise, and to generally make determinations of how and what we source, as well as when and from where we source it.” The firm emphasizes that “to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns, we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores, maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store, and be flexible in our allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories,” reflecting operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration in response to external pressures. It acknowledges that its “ability to allocate, deliver, and maintain our preferred mix and level of inventory has been impacted in recent years by temporary store closures, inflationary pressures, global supply chain disruptions, and other challenges, as a result of events, including the global COVID-19 pandemic,” illustrating resilience in maintaining integrity under extreme or exceptional conditions. The report highlights that the business model “allows us greater flexibility to meet consumer product preferences and trends than many traditional retailers (for example, by expanding and contracting merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes),” demonstrating adaptive strategies and dynamic capabilities. The company’s reliance on forecasting processes that “seek to plan sales and align expenses” and its continued investments in information technology—including “planning; purchasing; sales, including point-of-sale processing and e-commerce; supply chain management; inventory management; human resources; financial management; communications; information security; and legal and regulatory compliance”—together with “effective disaster recovery plans,” underscores efforts to sustain business continuity and system resilience. Disclosures about the “risk of compromise or disruption” to IT systems, the need for “additional mitigation strategies and investments across our IT security workforce, technologies and processes,” and the potential for “material business disruption, liability and reputational damage” from updating or replacing its systems illustrate active risk mitigation and change management. Financial resilience measures—such as routinely entering into “inventory-related derivative instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates,” hedging freight costs and closely monitoring debt and liquidity sources—reflect strategies for safeguarding performance under pressure. The company also recognizes that failure to “effectively attract qualified individuals, train them in our business model, support their development, engage them in our business, and retain them in sufficient numbers” could impair its ability to adapt and flourish, underscoring the importance of human capital resilience. Finally, acknowledgment of the need to comply with evolving corporate governance, regulatory and ESG requirements, manage reputational threats, and navigate expansion into “new international jurisdictions” by “effectively communicating and implementing company policies and practices in new, possibly remote, jurisdictions,” highlights comprehensive mechanisms aimed at preserving the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

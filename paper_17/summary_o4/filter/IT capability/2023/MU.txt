The Company confronted a wide array of internal and external disturbances—from operational process interruptions due to equipment failures, power outages, natural disasters, and climate events to supply chain disruptions, geopolitical and regulatory actions (including export controls and the CAC cybersecurity decision), economic downturns, and volatile customer inventory levels—that challenged its ability to maintain business continuity and operational flexibility. In response, the Company employed resilience strategies encompassing geographic dispersion of manufacturing sites and suppliers, dynamic capacity management (including wafer-start reductions and underutilization cost charges), and resource reconfiguration through its 2023 restructuring plan, which targeted a 15% headcount reduction and substantial operating‐expense cuts to preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions. Driven by a systemic perspective on competitive advantage, the Company optimized its product portfolio mix, accelerated investment in advanced process and product innovations such as EUV lithography and leading-edge DRAM and NAND nodes, and pursued disciplined capital allocation—balancing significant fab expansions (including U.S. CHIPS Act-contingent projects), debt and equity financing, and partner contributions—to ensure sufficient financial resources and adaptability. Through robust inter-organizational collaboration with third-party manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics partners, stringent intellectual property and cybersecurity controls, and adherence to responsible sourcing and environmental, social, and governance criteria, the Company sought to absorb strain, reconfigure its strategic initiatives, and reconstitute its trajectories toward future growth, thereby reinforcing its capacity to sustain integrity, mitigate risks, and emerge stronger from unexpected events.

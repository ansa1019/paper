Throughout its risk factors and management’s discussion and analysis, the Company discloses a comprehensive set of strategies, investments, capabilities and processes intended to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite economic uncertainty, competitive pressures, labor disruptions, cybersecurity incidents, regulatory changes, natural disasters, climate change and other external variations. The report highlights investments in IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery capabilities to maintain business continuity; reliance on a large, diverse global workforce and strategic initiatives—such as combining its network with digital capabilities, acquiring specialized logistics and technology providers, right-sizing the operating model and exploring strategic alternatives—to adapt to challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions; disciplined capital allocation, regularly evaluated financing strategies and hedging instruments to mitigate fuel price, currency exchange and interest-rate volatility; robust self-insurance reserves based on actuarial estimates to manage liability and workers’ compensation exposures; periodic testing and adjustment of asset valuations, including annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments and remeasurement of long-lived assets when utilization declines; and forward-looking commitments to capital projects, environmental sustainability goals and pension and benefit contributions to ensure adequate resources under both nominal and extreme conditions. Collectively, these disclosures reflect the Company’s systemic perspective on organizational resilience as the maintenance of integrity and performance under internal and external pressures.

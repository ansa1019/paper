The Company continually evaluates and enhances its procedures and safeguards to defend against persistent and sophisticated cyberattacks and other security breaches, recognizing that such preventative actions demand significant resources and management attention and that no assurances can be given that they will adequately repel all threats or prevent disruptions. It relies on an extensive network of internal systems and third-party suppliers to deliver services and acknowledges that system, network or infrastructure failures—whether due to severe weather, natural disasters, power outages, human error, policy non-compliance or other internal or external disturbances—could interrupt service, damage its reputation, incur remediation costs for repairing infrastructure and systems, and require the deployment of additional resources to maintain integrity and performance. To preserve business continuity and competitive advantage, the Company expects to adapt to technological developments by investing in artificial intelligence, machine learning and the ongoing expansion and enhancement of its nationwide 5G network, while also introducing new offerings to meet evolving customer needs. In fulfilling extensive government commitments—ranging from accelerated 5G network build-out, high-speed wireless service delivery to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives—the Company has allocated material financial and managerial resources and accepts that non-compliance risks fines, reputational harm and diversion of executive focus. Through merger integration and restructuring activities, including the decommissioning of legacy networks and consolidation of network, retail, IT and back-office operations, the Company seeks to reconfigure its asset base, realize synergies and improve operational flexibility under varying conditions. Its use of securitization transactions to manage receivables and maintenance of committed financing facilities, including a revolving credit agreement and a commercial paper program, further underpin its financial resilience by ensuring access to liquidity. Finally, the Company recognizes that delays or failures in system modernization and technology integration could impair its ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, recover promptly from outages, safeguard information, and maintain satisfactory customer and employee experiences, and therefore continues to strengthen its dynamic capabilities to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity.

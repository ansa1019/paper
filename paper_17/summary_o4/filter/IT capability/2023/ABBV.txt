AbbVie’s Form 10-K discloses a wide range of measures and strategic investments designed to preserve continuity and maintain performance under internal and external pressures. The company highlights its ongoing risk assessment and mitigation of interruptions in single-source raw materials, complex biologics manufacturing and third-party service providers, along with business interruption insurance and contingency planning. AbbVie describes how public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic prompted modifications to business practices and coordination with government authorities to safeguard employees, patients and supply chains. It underscores substantial resource allocation to research, development and regulatory compliance despite high failure rates and lengthy approval processes, thereby sustaining operational flexibility through a diversified pipeline of mid- and late-stage compounds. The company further notes its disciplined financial management—maintaining revolving credit facilities, monitoring economic and customer credit risks, implementing cybersecurity protections for its information technology systems, repurchasing shares and leveraging operating cash flows—to ensure liquidity, adapt to pricing, legislative and market shifts, and reconfigure strategic trajectories toward long-term growth while preserving core functioning in the face of adversity.

The Company’s annual report emphasizes that sustaining business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions relies on a robust and scalable technical infrastructure designed with sufficient reliability, redundancy, and capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance during service disruptions, catastrophic events, and crises; it identifies a multifaceted set of internal and external pressures—including cyber-incidents, operating system interoperability changes, supply-chain and manufacturing risks, inventory constraints, natural disasters, and geopolitical or regulatory actions—that could impair its ability to deliver products and services, and describes resilience strategies such as diversification of data centers and network resources, cost-reduction initiatives balanced against long-term user experience priorities, resource reallocation toward privacy-enhancing and artificial intelligence technologies, and contingency planning for emergency management and crisis response. The report further highlights strategic adaptation through continuous evolution of advertising systems and formats, development of new products and metaverse capabilities, and selective acquisitions to reconfigure competencies, all supported by organizational change processes, risk assessment and mitigation mechanisms, inter-organizational collaboration, and governance structures aimed at preserving organizational health, sustaining firm performance under pressure, and ensuring the maintenance of integrity and functionality—even under extreme or exceptional conditions.

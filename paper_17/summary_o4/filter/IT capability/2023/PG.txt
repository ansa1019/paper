The company acknowledges that its ability to meet customer needs and achieve cost targets depends on maintaining key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole‐supplier or sole‐manufacturing plant arrangements, and observes that the loss or disruption of such arrangements has at times interrupted and could in the future interrupt product supply, which, if not effectively managed and remedied, could adversely impact the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. It highlights that its businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures—particularly due to changes in commodities, labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare costs—and that failure to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost‐saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share, could adversely affect its results of operations or cash flows. The discussion further emphasizes that achieving business objectives requires successful responses to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms, and that the success of its reputation and brand equity hinges on effective management of real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, supply chain practices and broader stakeholder perceptions. The company also warns that a significant information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of key IT or OT systems or their service providers could have a material adverse impact on its business or reputation if its business continuity plans do not effectively address such failures on a timely basis, potentially causing interruptions in operations and exposing it to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. It must successfully manage the demand, supply and operational challenges associated with future disease outbreaks, including significant reductions or volatility in demand, shifts in consumer behavior and governmental mandates limiting or closing facilities, and concedes that despite efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, outcomes depend on factors beyond its knowledge or control. In its management’s discussion and analysis, the company underscores that delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth, strong cash generation and ongoing productivity improvements that enable investments in product and packaging innovation, more efficient and effective supply chains, equity and awareness‐building brand advertising and other programs; that it acts with agility and is constructively disrupting its industry and operating model to create more value; and that it has declared focus areas to strengthen performance—namely leveraging environmental sustainability for innovation, increasing digital acumen to drive preference and efficiency, developing next-level supply chain capabilities for flexibility, agility, resilience and productivity, and delivering an employee value proposition to attract, retain and develop key talent.

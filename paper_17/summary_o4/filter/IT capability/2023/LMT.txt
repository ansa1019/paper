Management acknowledges that while it seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks, business continuity cannot eliminate all uncertainties and internal or external variations—such as government funding delays, continuing resolutions or shutdowns—that may restrict new contract starts, delay or reduce orders, cancel programs and disrupt cash flows. The firm’s reliance on U.S. government appropriations subjects it to shifting funding priorities, budget compromises, heightened geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions, all of which can constrain operational flexibility, competitive positioning and performance under pressure. Supply chain resilience is challenged by single or sole‐source dependencies, global semiconductor shortages, supplier performance issues and evolving procurement regulations, resulting in increased lead times, cost pressures, delivery delays and market volatility. To mitigate these risks, the company employs long‐term supply agreements, alternative domestic and allied sourcing, inventory management and strategic investments in emerging technologies and digital transformation to bolster process efficiencies, resource allocation and systemic adaptability. Under both cost‐reimbursable and fixed‐price contracts, complex technical requirements, cost estimation uncertainties, schedule variances, workforce constraints, inflation, contract audits and potential terminations for convenience or default create performance risks that may necessitate provisions for reach-forward losses. The firm’s balanced capital deployment strategy—anchored by free cash flow generation, disciplined debt management and access to credit facilities—supports resource generation, strategic agility and transformation to ensure system integrity and performance maintenance. Human capital resilience is addressed through talent development, hybrid work models and succession planning, while environmental remediation, cybersecurity, pension risk transfers and preparedness for public health outbreaks further underscore the need for ongoing risk assessment, adaptive strategies and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

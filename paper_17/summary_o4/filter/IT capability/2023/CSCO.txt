The report emphasizes that the company’s operating results “have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment,” including its “ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments” and risks of “excess and obsolete inventories” and “supply constraints.” It describes how “in past periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the significant supply constraints seen industry‐wide” and how “when facing component supply‐related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations,” illustrating resource deployment, risk mitigation, and adaptation under adversity. The disclosure also highlights strategic reconfiguration of the business model toward “more software and subscription offerings” to preserve performance, and underscores operational flexibility through agreements that allow the option “to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.” It further acknowledges the need to manage nonlinearity in manufacturing lead times and shipping patterns, to optimize “inventory build and customer delivery plans,” and to coordinate with suppliers and contract manufacturers to secure supply coverage and pricing, all of which reflect a systemic perspective on maintaining business continuity, reconfiguring operations in response to disruptions, and preserving organizational functioning under challenging conditions.

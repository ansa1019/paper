In the 2023 Form 10-K, Lam Research discloses that during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for its products and services it faces significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, workforce training and assimilation, and in sizing its supply chain infrastructure, facilities and workforce on a timely basis, and therefore continuously reassesses strategic resource allocation choices to adapt to the changing business environment and scale capacity without incurring excess fixed costs. The company reports deploying cost management programs to align expenditures with anticipated revenue streams and maintaining investments in research and development and extensive worldwide customer service and support capabilities even in downturns. To reinforce its operational resilience, Lam Research endeavors to establish alternative sources of supply—recognizing that direct suppliers and outsource providers may suffer setbacks, exclusivity constraints or force majeure events—and hedges anticipated foreign currency cash flows to mitigate exchange-rate variability. It maintains business continuity plans for its concentrated manufacturing and R&D facilities, which were activated during the COVID-19 pandemic to modify business processes, qualify suppliers, enforce social distancing, implement telework arrangements and adjust capital expansion projects. In January 2023, the company initiated a restructuring plan involving workforce reductions, relocation of manufacturing activities to existing facilities and exit from selected supplier arrangements to better align its cost structure and infrastructure with economic and market realities, while exercising discretion in the timing and prioritization of manufacturing and deliveries to balance customer requirements and resource availability. Lam Research acknowledges its supply chain, manufacturing operations and customer relationships may be disrupted by natural or man-made disasters, climate change, geopolitical disputes and market volatility, and further expects that forecasted operating cash flows combined with existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will support its operational, investment, financing and capital-redistribution needs through at least the next twelve months, subject to the uncertainties inherent in the semiconductor industry and the global economy.

Thermo Fisher Scientific employs a risk-based approach to implementing and reviewing security controls across its information technology systems and third-party service providers and conducts due diligence in connection with acquisitions, leverages data backups across most of its systems while acknowledging that its disaster recovery planning may not address every eventuality, and pursues strategic growth investments—defined as targeted spending to enhance commercial capabilities, geographic sales reach, e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, service and operational infrastructure, research and development, commercial tools, and employee incentives—alongside productivity improvements under its Practical Process Improvement business system, which encompasses continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives, restructuring actions such as headcount reductions and facility consolidations, and low-cost region manufacturing; restructuring actions taken in 2023, which generated approximately $0.2 billion of charges, are expected to realize annual cost savings of approximately $0.5 billion.  The company also directs substantial capital expenditures toward property, plant and equipment for capacity and capability investments; maintains financial resilience through a combination of significant cash and cash equivalents, a $5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with undrawn capacity maintained equivalent to outstanding commercial paper, the use of interest rate and cross-currency swaps which reduced net interest expense by approximately $116 million in 2023, and non-taxable intercompany loans and returns of capital to fund acquisitions, capacity expansion, and debt repayment outside the U.S.; and supports ongoing capital flexibility with a board-authorized $4 billion share repurchase program, of which $3 billion was executed early in 2024, reinforcing the company’s ability to maintain operations and preserve financial strength under varying internal and external pressures.

The Company identifies its reliance on ongoing resource allocation to adapt to technological change by continuing to innovate and extend its platform, introduce new and enhanced products, features, services and business models, and develop and reconfigure its skills, tools and capabilitiesâ€”activities that uphold its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. It further describes measures to ensure business continuity and system resilience through investments in cybersecurity protections and ISO 27001 certification, disaster recovery planning, system redundancy and the design of its software and computer systems to utilize public cloud and third-party infrastructure with contingency planning for service interruptions, particularly during critical peak periods. The Company notes its operational flexibility in handling extremely heavy customer demand and mitigating the risk of interruptions in online services, as well as its adaptation strategies in response to climate-related events and natural disasters by establishing robust environmental programs, partnering with organizations focused on climate risk mitigation, and planning for recovery from catastrophic events near seismic faults. In addition, the Company discusses its risk assessment and mitigation of global macroeconomic uncertainty, geopolitical conditions, pandemics and supply chain disruptions through strengthened oversight of external service providers and continuous investment in its information technology infrastructure and privacy and security capabilities. The risk factors also outline integration and reconfiguration processes related to acquisition and divestiture activities to reconstruct operational trajectories, realize synergies, and minimize disruption, while the MD&A emphasizes strategic planning, proactive measures and organizational coherence as means to reconstitute and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations, reflecting a multifaceted approach to maintaining performance, system integrity and organizational resilience under diverse pressures.

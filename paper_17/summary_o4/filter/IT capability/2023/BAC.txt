Bank of America’s annual report describes extensive measures to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by developing comprehensive contingency plans to respond in the event of potential adverse economic, operational, financial or market stress conditions, including monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable the firm to increase capital and/or liquidity, access funding sources and reduce risk through asset and business resiliency strategies. The report emphasizes that effective management of business continuity depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of operations and information systems, backup systems and other safeguards to support critical business operations and customer services through disruptions such as natural disasters, electronic or physical infrastructure outages, cyber events, pandemics and geopolitical conflicts. It further describes operational risk management and operational resiliency capabilities designed to permit the firm to meet the expectations of its customers and clients through a range of operating conditions and to reconstitute operations under crisis scenarios. Liquidity risk disclosures explain the maintenance of readily available assets—cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities—to meet contractual and contingent obligations, and the use of stress testing, contingency funding plans and an enterprise resolution strategy, including intercompany arrangements to support a “single point of entry” approach, to withstand extreme market stress. Interest rate risk management and modeling, including instantaneous parallel and non-parallel curve shocks, as well as rigorous trading portfolio var and scenario stress testing, underscore the institution’s commitment to reconfiguring and adapting balance sheet and trading activities in response to dynamic interest rate movements. Finally, climate risk analyses of both physical risks—such as increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events and supply chain disruptions—and transition risks toward a low-carbon economy are integrated within an enterprise climate risk framework, demonstrating Bank of America’s emphasis on foreseeing, confronting and benefiting from environmental perturbations and thereby reinforcing its capacity for organizational resilience.

Amgen’s risk disclosures and management’s discussion describe a multifaceted approach to preserving positive adjustment under internal and external perturbations by maintaining business continuity and operational flexibility across its global organization. The company highlights reliance on sophisticated information technology systems, coupled with cybersecurity monitoring and cyber-liability insurance, to mitigate and recover from breaches; the use of backup diesel-powered generators in Puerto Rico after hurricanes; qualifications of multiple third-party contract manufacturers and logistics providers to guard against single-source disruptions; and periodic business continuity planning and risk assessments to address natural disasters, pandemics and geopolitical conflicts. Financial resilience is supported by cross-currency and interest-rate swap agreements, a $4 billion revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop, disciplined capital allocation—including maintaining cash reserves, debt management and dividend policies—and dynamic hedging to absorb market volatility. Amgen further outlines structured integration and resource reconfiguration processes for acquisitions, regular reviews of environmental, social and governance objectives, and crisis response protocols to adapt to shifting regulatory, reimbursement and economic landscapes, collectively reflecting the organization’s capacity to absorb strain, reconstitute operations and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

The annual report describes multiple facets of the company’s efforts to “absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity,” including significant investments to maintain and enhance information security and controls and to investigate and mitigate security vulnerabilities; the operation and frequent testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans designed to recover all critical business functions, assets and data after operational failures, natural disasters or cyber‐attacks; proactive monitoring and management of geopolitical, economic, regulatory and technological changes—ranging from rapid technological evolution and artificial‐intelligence regulation to shifts in card network fees, tax laws, antitrust requirements, data privacy regimes and foreign currency exchange rates—that could disrupt continuity or constrain service delivery; reliance on diversified liquidity and financing mechanisms, such as commercial paper programs, a multicurrency revolving credit facility, foreign lines of credit and guarantees of joint‐venture debt, to ensure operational flexibility under extreme or unexpected conditions; resource reconfiguration through the disciplined acquisition, integration or divestiture of complementary businesses and the realignment of reportable segments to enhance operational performance, create strategic synergies and reconstitute future trajectories of growth; allocation of contingency reserves, indemnification arrangements and credit‐risk management programs to absorb losses from merchant defaults, chargebacks or third‐party service failures; measures to mitigate supply‐chain disruptions and maintain vendor and alliance partner relationships despite shortages, delays or facility closures; continual adaptation of policies and procedures in response to evolving cybersecurity, data localization, consumer protection and payment‐network rules; management of goodwill, intangible assets and debt covenants to preserve financial integrity and maintain access to capital; focus on attracting, retaining and developing key personnel as a primary actor in sustaining organizational health; and ongoing efforts to integrate platforms and value-added solutions in order to preserve system integrity, enable operational continuity and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

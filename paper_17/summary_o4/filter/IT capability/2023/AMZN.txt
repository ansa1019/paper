In the “Risk Factors” section we describe that events and uncertainties—including seasonality-driven demand fluctuations, natural or human-caused disasters, extreme weather, public health crises, geopolitical events, economic or regulatory developments, and unforeseen circumstances—could materially impair our operations, growth, reputation, financial condition, and cash flows, and that our ability to maintain business continuity depends on accurately forecasting demand, managing inventory levels to avoid significant markdowns or write-offs, and staffing our fulfillment network and customer service centers to meet peak requirements. We acknowledge that system interruptions and delays resulting from sudden surges in web traffic or infrastructure failures can reduce sales and harm customer experience, that our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not address every disruption, and that failures to predict demand or optimize data center and fulfillment capacity may lead to service interruptions and increased costs. Rapid global expansion and the complexity of scaling our management, operations, systems, and technical performance impose significant strain on our resources and require ongoing strategic investments in technology infrastructure, fulfillment capacity, security measures, and process efficiencies to preserve service levels and operational flexibility. Our reliance on third-party shipping providers and single-source suppliers for critical components exposes us to supply chain disruptions and performance variability that necessitate adaptive logistics, risk mitigation strategies, and resource reallocation. We maintain substantial cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, alongside committed borrowing facilities, and continuously evaluate our capital structure, financing alternatives, and operational processes to support liquidity, fund strategic initiatives, and sustain or restore performance under challenging conditions.

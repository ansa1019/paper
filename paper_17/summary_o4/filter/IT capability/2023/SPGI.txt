The company acknowledges in its risk factor disclosures that its information systems and networks, and those of its third-party service providers, are exposed to evolving cyber-security threats that may defeat measures designed to anticipate, detect, avoid, or mitigate breaches, which could materially interrupt or compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information critical to its operations; as a result, it devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update systems, processes and cyber-security technologies, to conduct cyber due diligence in acquisitions, to devise incident response and communication protocols, and to maintain disaster recovery plans with backup facilities, recognizing that such plans may not be fully redundant or always sufficient. The company further discloses that disruptions in the physical or technological infrastructure—whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, pandemics, civil unrest, war, terrorism or geopolitical events—could materially impair its ability to store, process or deliver data, underscoring the need for robust business continuity planning, office succession strategies and coordination with third-party providers, including cloud services, despite the risk that integration and transition activities may introduce material deficiencies or additional liabilities. It describes the possibility that localized or regional disasters, compounded by climate-driven extreme weather, could challenge the availability of personnel, facilities and critical systems, potentially causing operational challenges, loss of human capital, regulatory exposures, reputational harm and client relationship damage; accordingly, it regularly assesses and improves its business continuity plans, key management succession arrangements and internal controls. The disclosures also highlight that the company’s ability to compete and innovate in the face of market volatility, regulatory changes and technological disruption relies on continuous investments in new processes, technologies, change-management efforts and cross-enterprise collaboration to preserve or improve functioning under pressure, support rapid adaptation to internal or external variations and disturbances, and sustain performance—at least partially—in adverse, extreme or exceptional conditions.

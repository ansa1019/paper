Chubb’s enterprise-wide resilience framework leverages underwriting controls, risk models, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance to manage exposures to natural and man-made catastrophes, pandemics, and cyber events that could otherwise generate substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition. The process of establishing reserves “can be highly complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments” and actuarial staff in each of our segments “regularly evaluates the levels of loss reserves,” reflecting the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. We maintain a disciplined underwriting process throughout our insurance operations, including geographic diversification, excess of loss coverage, per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps in proportional reinsurance, and ongoing risk transfer reviews supported by tests such as “the ratio of the net present value of losses and commissions divided by the net present value of premiums” to confirm a reasonable possibility of significant loss. Counterparty risk is controlled through collateral requirements, credit rating-based limits, and a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance that is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and forward-looking default factors. Our investment portfolio is broadly diversified across geographies, sectors, and issuers, with durations “matched” to insurance liabilities, periodic assessments of expected credit losses, and sensitivity testing—such as estimating the impact of a 100-basis-point increase in interest rates—thereby preserving system integrity. To ensure operational continuity and business continuity, we hold invested assets in cash and short-term securities, use repurchase agreements as a low-cost funding alternative, maintain multi-currency notional cash pooling programs, and secure credit facilities subject to covenants on consolidated net worth and ratios of consolidated debt to total capitalization, thus maintaining liquidity for unforeseen claims demands. Catastrophe risk accumulation is actively monitored and managed by “using internal and external data together with sophisticated, analytical catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques,” and we conduct climate change and pandemic stress scenarios to inform our reinsurance protection and capital deployment. Financial strength ratings from recognized rating agencies provide strategic foresight for capital management, as any downgrade could require collateral postings or cancellations of premium, highlighting the multifaceted measures we employ to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change in order to survive, grow, and flourish.

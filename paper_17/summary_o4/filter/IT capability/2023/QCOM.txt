We assess a broad spectrum of risks and uncertainties that could disrupt our operations and require significant management attention, and in response we have implemented supply strategies designed to provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins—establishing alternate suppliers, qualifying new sources for critical integrated circuit products, entering multi-year capacity commitments and maintaining a $4.3 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program—to mitigate interruptions and preserve operational continuity; we actively manage inventory levels and accounts receivable through advance supply agreements and utilization of prior payments to adapt to fluctuating customer demand and elevated customer inventories; in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 we initiated restructuring actions to reduce fixed-cost underutilization and optimize our cost structure, recording $712 million of related severance charges and expecting completion in the first half of fiscal 2024; we maintain a robust cybersecurity program aligned with international frameworks to identify, remediate and defend against evolving threats to our IT systems and proprietary information; we continue to invest in research and development of wireless, 5G and integrated circuit technologies and pursue strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and minority investments to diversify into automotive, IoT and other new markets, recording impairment losses prudently when business realignments necessitate it; we manage potential disruptions arising from U.S. and Chinese trade and national security policies, geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, climate change and health crises by diversifying manufacturing and warehouse locations, securing export licenses, carrying insurance, complying with environmental, health and safety regulations and monitoring purchase and lease obligations; our treasury and tax planning optimize foreign-derived intangible income deductions, manage repatriation obligations and respond to evolving domestic and international tax regimes; and we balance capital allocation among dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and debt issuances—issuing $1.9 billion of fixed-rate notes with staggered maturities, repurchasing $3.0 billion of common stock and paying $3.5 billion of dividends—to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility in a volatile macroeconomic environment.

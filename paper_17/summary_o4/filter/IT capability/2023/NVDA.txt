Nvidia’s risk disclosures emphasize its efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, noting that “business disruptions could harm our operations and financial results” and acknowledging that “our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities,” given that “our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics” and that “in the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us…our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.” To absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity, the company explains that “we build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand,” “we have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity,” “we have…entered…and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments,” and “we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors,” while also recognizing that “deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges…which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases,” that “the timing and availability of these cloud services has changed and may continue to change, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines,” and that “while we have managed prior product transitions…and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.” In addressing operational flexibility and risk mitigation, Nvidia states that “to defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features” and “we must also continue to develop our security measures…designed to ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place,” and it warns that “any ERP system implementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results.” Under external pressures and strategic resilience, management reports that “during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions…and export licensing requirements…we transitioned some operations…out of China and Hong Kong,” cautioning that “any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue,” even as the company works “to expand our data center product portfolio to offer new solutions…for which the USG does not require a license,” while noting that “our competitive position has been harmed…if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls,” which “may again change…and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions.” Finally, in addressing environmental perturbations and systemic resilience, Nvidia cautions that “climate change may have a long-term impact on our business,” that “extreme heat and wind…may lead to power safety shut offs…impairing the ability of our employees to work effectively,” and that “climate change…may disrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations.”

Our disclosures describe a multifaceted set of risks and operational safeguards that relate directly to our ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We acknowledge that “other events beyond our control such as pandemics and epidemics, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, wars and regional hostilities, travel-related accidents, or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel may disrupt or limit the ability or willingness of travelers to visit certain locations,” and that “because these events and their impacts and responses to them are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, demand for and provision of our services, and relationships with travel service providers and other partners.” We maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans and seek “to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems,” yet we also recognize that “if such events were to occur, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately and it could result in lengthy interruptions or delays in our services,” that our “existing IT business continuity and disaster recovery practices are less effective against certain types of attacks such as ransomware,” and that “any system failure that causes an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation, damage our brands, increase customer service costs, or result in lost business.” We identify our reliance on “various third-party distribution channels (i.e., marketing affiliates),” “search and meta-search services,” “payment processors,” and other outsourced resources as critical dependencies whose “damage, breach of, or interruption in these third-party services and systems” could prevent bookings, compromise data, disrupt cash flows, or otherwise undermine our operational continuity and competitive advantage. We note that “if the logic determining placement and display of results of a consumer’s search changes,” our own placement and costs can be adversely affected. We describe ongoing initiatives to “enhance our payments capabilities,” invest in cloud computing, automated systems, and system upgrades to support growth and adapt to technological and market changes, while acknowledging the complexity of highly automated, multi-input processes that “mitigate the risk of human error but…make testing, troubleshooting, and auditing more difficult,” and may “make it difficult to quickly detect and correct errors embedded in these processes or systems.” We emphasize that our “business relies on a global supply chain of third party service providers and we are exposed to risks because we rely on the resilience, security, and legal compliance of their products and services,” as well as on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees and to manage outsourced operations across multiple geographies. Finally, we recognize that “evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards and disclosures,” “availability and cost of limiting or offsetting our use of carbon-based energy sources,” and our climate-related commitments add resource constraints and planning complexities, and that “failing to meet those objectives may adversely impact our reputation, employee retention, and willingness of customers and partners to do business with us.”

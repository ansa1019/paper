The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize its ongoing efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions through comprehensive risk mitigation and resilience strategies, including investments and processes to absorb strains (e.g., “we believe our operations are efficient” yet may face “disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes… pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events… labor issues or other shipping problems”), preservation of business continuity via orderly merchandise receiving and distribution, and reliance on third-party and in-house logistics providers to support its e-commerce operations while recognizing the negative effects when these providers are unable to provide services in a timely fashion. It highlights that “availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital to our business” and that it is “building strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events,” noting “substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency” and that “failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business.” The Company describes its adaptive merchandising and pricing strategies—such as working with suppliers to share cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing at greater volumes, holding prices steady or reducing prices to drive sales—to respond to inflationary pressures and uncertainty in economic conditions, asserting that “while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes…the opposite of brittleness” and that adjustments to “merchandise mix… online offerings” have supported performance maintenance. It further outlines its capacity to absorb financial strain through a diversified funding model—“cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments… with capacity under existing and available credit agreements”—and prudent capital deployment for new and relocated warehouses, IT transformation, and supply-chain enhancements, while cautioning that natural disasters, pandemics, currency fluctuations, and regulatory or market disruptions could necessitate suspension of operations or additional resource allocation, thereby underscoring a systemic perspective on organizational resilience encompassing risk assessment, operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration, and recovery mechanisms.

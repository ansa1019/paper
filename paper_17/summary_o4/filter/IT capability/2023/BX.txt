The report repeatedly describes the firm’s ability—or need—to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse internal or external variations, such as difficult market, economic and geopolitical conditions, elevated inflation, high and volatile interest rates, rapidly changing regulatory regimes, strained credit markets, cyber-security threats, pandemics, climate-related events, and terrorism, all of which may materially reduce revenue, disrupt operations and threaten continuity. It highlights management actions taken or contemplated to maintain positive adjustment in these challenging conditions, including reducing fixed costs and other expenses to preserve profitability; reallocating resources by cutting or eliminating certain services or service providers; terminating or restructuring personnel; adjusting investment allocations and operational plans; negotiating debt refinancing or rolling over credit facilities; deploying capital opportunistically or constraining new commitments to match liquidity needs; hedging exposures with derivatives; and expanding business initiatives, such as insurance-dedicated platforms, alternative capital vehicles and diversified product offerings, to strengthen resilience. The firm also notes that dedicated risk-management processes, including stress testing, due diligence, risk assessment, scenario analysis and contingent liquidity planning, are employed to identify and mitigate potential operational, financial, compliance and reputational risks, while ongoing monitoring of fund-level and partner-level performance, together with governance measures such as valuation reviews, independent audits and executive oversight, aim to preserve integrity and performance—at least partially—even when market benchmarks, asset valuations or portfolio company cash flows deteriorate. These descriptions collectively reflect an organizational emphasis on systemic flexibility, adaptive strategies, crisis preparedness and the maintenance of service and investment continuity under pressures, constraints, failures, errors, hazards and other exceptional conditions.

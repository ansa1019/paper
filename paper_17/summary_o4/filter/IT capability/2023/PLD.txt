Consistent with the definition of organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007: 3418), the registrant acknowledges exposures to social, geopolitical, economic and environmental risks across its global operations—including currency volatility, supply‐chain disruptions, rising material costs, labor shortages, regulatory change, climate‐related hazards, cybersecurity incidents and public health crises—and describes strategies to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity. These include diversifying funding sources through access to global capital markets and credit facilities, maintaining substantial liquidity reserves, hedging foreign currency and interest rate exposures by borrowing in local currencies and using derivative instruments, and dynamically allocating capital to development, acquisitions, building improvements and renewable energy assets in response to evolving market rents and customer needs. To mitigate disruptions, the company employs system redundancy and disaster recovery plans, pursues comprehensive insurance programs (including property damage, rental loss, environmental and catastrophe coverage with periodic self‐insurance in seismic zones), conducts annual coverage reviews, and shares financing and operational responsibilities through co‐investment ventures. Governance measures—such as compliance with multiple international laws, maintenance of investment‐grade credit ratings, a dividend policy aligned with REIT distribution requirements, same‐store portfolio analyses and mark‐to‐market lease adjustments—further enable the organization to reconfigure its operating trajectory, reconstitute resources, and maintain performance and growth in turbulent markets.

NEE and FPL’s risk factors disclose that their business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to a variety of internal and external pressures—regulatory, political, economic, operational, technological, environmental and market-based—that may hinder their ability to adapt to unexpected events and maintain operational flexibility, preserve performance and recover from adversity. They describe extensive federal, state and local regulation governing permitting, planning, construction, operation, cost recovery and rate structures, noting that any inability to recover costs or achieve authorized returns in base rates or cost recovery clauses could materially adversely affect the business and limit investment in resilience-enhancing assets. Development and operational risks, including supply chain disruptions, inability to obtain licenses, escalating material costs, contractor disputes, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hurricanes, floods and other severe events, are identified as potential sources of service interruptions, increased expenses, lost revenues and damage to facilities, requiring actions such as additional winterizing of critical equipment, modifying plant operations and expanding load shedding options. The reports highlight the potential for facility start-up failures, fuel and resource constraints, use of unproven technologies, maintenance outages and unplanned outages to impair generation and delivery capabilities, along with the consequences of prolonged outages, equipment breakdowns, environmental violations, wildlife mortality risks, water availability limitations, fuel transportation failures and competitive pressures from distributed generation. Terrorism, cyberattacks and other disruptive threats are cited as risks to critical infrastructure, information systems and operational continuity, potentially limiting abilities to generate, transmit or bill for power and undermining stakeholder engagement and trust. The companies’ use of derivative instruments, hedging strategies, value-at-risk models and credit enhancement mechanisms, such as letters of credit, guarantees and collateral posting, is described as essential for mitigating commodity price, interest rate and credit exposures, while reductions in market liquidity and variations from historical price patterns may expose them to significant financial losses. The importance of diversified liquidity and capital resources—cash flows from operations, revolving credit facilities, debt and equity issuances, shelf registrations and strategic participation in project finance—is underscored to support working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities and acquisitions under adverse conditions. Subsidiary guarantees, support agreements and structured payables for power purchase agreements, project financings and nuclear decommissioning obligations are also noted as critical to ensuring business continuity. The maintenance of insurance coverage, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, decommissioning fund management and adherence to regulatory accounting treatments for storm restoration and pension benefit plan funding further exemplify resilience mechanisms intended to absorb strain, preserve operating capabilities and maintain system integrity while navigating extreme conditions, regulatory uncertainties and evolving technological and market landscapes.

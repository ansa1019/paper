The Company emphasizes the critical importance of continually introducing and enhancing products, services and solutions to retain customers and attract new business, noting that failure to anticipate technological trends or devote appropriate resources to adapt can materially harm operations; it outlines business continuity and operational flexibility measures including disaster recovery planning, infrastructure redundancy, capacity planning and third-party service provider management, as many critical applications reside in only one data center and disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities, while acknowledging that service interruptions, hardware or software failures or errors could disrupt business operations and harm customer relationships. It describes risk mitigation and resource allocation strategies in development and use of AI technologies—investing in generative AI capabilities, content labeling, governance frameworks and responsible use frameworks—to respond to rapid technological change and evolving regulatory environments, and delineates acquisition integration challenges in achieving financial and strategic goals, integrating operations, technologies, culture and personnel, reconstituting operations and refocusing management resources. To preserve system integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances, the Company outlines robust information security and incident response capabilities, dedicating resources to engineering secure products, enhancing reliability features, code hardening, penetration testing, reviewing controls and improving incident response processes, while noting elevated risks from geopolitical tensions, cyberattacks, pandemics and climate-related catastrophic events. The Company further highlights the need to manage global regulatory compliance in data protection, privacy and cross-border transfers, maintain financial resilience through cash flow hedging, professional investment management and capital structure flexibility, and sustain organizational health and adaptability in a hybrid work environment, complex sales cycles, and intensely competitive and turbulent global markets, thereby enabling positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

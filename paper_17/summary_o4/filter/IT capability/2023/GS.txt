The risk factors disclosure emphasizes that the firm’s businesses may be disrupted by unforeseen or catastrophic events—“including pandemics, terrorist attacks, wars, extreme weather events or other natural disasters”—and that disruptions to its operational systems or third-party infrastructure “could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses,” despite “our resiliency plans and facilities” and “efforts to maintain business continuity.” It describes a comprehensive resilience framework that includes a firmwide operational risk and resilience committee, a contingency funding plan to manage potential cash and collateral outflows, regular stress testing of modeled liquidity outflows and intraday liquidity needs, and recovery and resolution planning with triggers and alerts to preserve system integrity. The text also notes efforts to “diversify our third-party vendors to increase our resiliency,” daily backtesting of market risk, adaptive cybersecurity defenses and business continuity protocols, and governance structures—spanning capital planning, liquidity management and scenario analyses—designed to mitigate risk, enable rapid adaptation and maintain functionality and performance under adverse conditions.

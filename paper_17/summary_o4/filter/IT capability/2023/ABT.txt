Abbott’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including ongoing actions to mitigate disruptions to its large and complex global supply chain—such as those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures and labor shortages—and the reconfiguration of production trajectories through alternative facility shipments, line conversions, production prioritization and importation of product following a voluntary infant formula recall. The company commits substantial resources to research, development and innovation to sustain competitive advantage and respond effectively to environmental disruptions, while recognizing inherent risks in regulatory approvals, manufacturing complexities and clinical outcomes. Abbott invests in sophisticated information systems and technology, monitors them continuously for cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities and regulatory changes, and employs hedging arrangements and professional expertise to manage foreign currency, tax and customer credit exposures, regularly analyzing historical trends to adjust reserves for rebates, allowances and doubtful accounts. Despite availability issues and cost increases for raw materials, packaging and transportation over the past three years, Abbott managed supply chain challenges without significant service interruption and partially offset inflationary effects through price adjustments and gross margin improvement initiatives. The company pursues strategic acquisitions, licensing arrangements and alliances, and may dispose of or spin off businesses to optimize resource deployment and integrate new technologies, while maintaining readily available financial resources—including investment-grade credit ratings, unused lines of credit and share repurchase authorizations—and monitoring indebtedness to preserve operational flexibility, funding for working capital, capital expenditures and shareholder returns.

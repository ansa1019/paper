Management continues to enhance its ability to absorb operational strain and preserve performance under internal and external disturbances by refining its transportation plan, adding network capacity, improving yard and facility operations, and maintaining a resource buffer to address surges in demand, weather disruptions, and unexpected traffic shifts. The company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business and devotes significant capital and human resources to protect systems and proprietary data, conduct hazard identification and risk assessments, and deploy predictive technologies—including additional hot‐wheel bearing detectors, real‐time railcar condition monitoring, and proprietary train‐builder software—to proactively intervene and prevent service interruptions, derailments, and cyber incidents. Severe weather and other natural phenomena are addressed through infrastructure hardening investments, contingency deployments of additional locomotives, and aggressive hiring of train, engine, and yard employees to maintain network fluidity and service reliability. A comprehensive safety management program centered on critical operating rules, culture initiatives, employee engagement, training, quality control, and targeted capital investments further supports operational resilience. Operational excellence efforts focus on running a fluid network, optimizing resource utilization, transforming the service product, and reducing cost structure, while a 2024 capital plan allocates approximately $3.4 billion to grow the business, replace aging assets, and enhance network resiliency. Management employs climate scenario analyses, sensitivity analyses of market and tax variables, and continuous monitoring of key performance metrics to inform liquidity and capital planning, ensuring sufficient borrowing capacity and adaptive responses to evolving regulatory, environmental, and market pressures to sustain business continuity, mitigate risk, and uphold service commitments under challenging conditions.

Our organizational resilience is supported by compliance programs and policies that are continually adjusted to meet a wide array of complex and evolving global regulations and laws, enabling us to adapt our product offerings, services, fees and other business aspects in response to regulatory pressures; by global settlement risk policies and procedures that limit credit exposure, require collateral when credit standards are not met and, as of September 30, 2023, include $10.1 billion of available liquidity specifically earmarked to fund daily settlements in the event of client funding failures, with additional liquidity available for working capital; by a $7 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program to support working capital requirements; and by an investment portfolio of marketable debt securities that is regularly reviewed for liquidity and potential impairment under changing market conditions. We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses under our operating rules, maintain a business continuity program designed to recover critical business functions, assets and data following operational disruptions, and recognize that recovery may not always be immediate or complete. During acquisitions and strategic investments, we incorporate due diligence on cybersecurity and operational resilience postures, controls, procedures and governance frameworks to mitigate integration risks, resource diversion and cultural integration challenges. We invest in infrastructure and human capital, including AI governance frameworks, to preserve operational flexibility, innovate responsively and manage advanced and persistent cyber-attack vectors—from malware and zero-day vulnerabilities to synthetic-media schemes—while acknowledging that evolving threats and third-party performance failures could disrupt our networks, systems and service delivery, lead to negative customer experiences and brand damage, and adversely affect our competitive positioning, transaction volumes and financial results.

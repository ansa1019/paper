The annual report repeatedly acknowledges the company’s exposure to disruptive events and its efforts to preserve or restore operations under adverse conditions, describing “natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions,” “global health crises, pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks” that have led to “unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities” and warning that any resurgence of such events “could negatively impact the economies and financial markets of the world and our business and financial statements.” It details operational flexibility and risk mitigation measures, noting that supply interruptions, delays or cost increases “can disrupt our ability to produce or deliver our products and/or increase our costs,” and it describes system redundancy and disaster recovery planning to guard against cyber-attacks, hardware failures, power outages or other unforeseen events, while warning that those plans “may be ineffective or inadequate” and that catastrophic losses due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, power shortage, public health crisis or other natural or man-made disasters “could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, diminish demand, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses.” The report also discusses strategic adaptability in response to market pressures—such as inflation, interest rates, regulatory change, competitive consolidation and shifts in customer preferences—through continued investment in new product innovation, global manufacturing capacity, digital capabilities and artificial intelligence, while recognizing that failures in these efforts “could adversely affect our competitiveness,” increase costs or delay offerings. It further addresses resource deployment and organizational change processes in the context of acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring, noting that delays or failures in executing these strategic initiatives “may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits,” and it highlights the necessity of maintaining relationships with key distributors, recruiting and retaining skilled employees, and complying with evolving environmental, health, safety, data privacy and industry-specific regulations to manage risks, reconfigure trajectories of response to disruptive events and help ensure the maintenance of positive adjustment and continuity of performance under challenging conditions.

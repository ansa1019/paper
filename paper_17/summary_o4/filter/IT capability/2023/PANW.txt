Our 2023 annual report repeatedly underscores that our operations and financial results are exposed to a broad spectrum of internal and external pressures—ranging from economic and geopolitical volatility to technological disruption, supply-chain constraints, credit and liquidity risks, cyber-security incidents, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, pandemics, or terrorism—that could materially impair our ability to maintain continuity of service and preserve performance under stress. We therefore emphasize the need to continuously enhance and scale our information-technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, controls, and headcount; to refine inventory forecasting and supply management with our manufacturing partners; to strengthen disaster-recovery and business-continuity plans; and to employ hedging and credit-risk mitigation strategies to absorb strain without sacrificing core functionality. We also highlight our commitment to anticipate and respond promptly to rapidly evolving market and technology developments—through targeted R&D investments, strategic acquisitions, and go-to-market adjustments—to reconfigure our product and subscription trajectories, sustain competitive advantage, and emerge stronger from disruptive events. In addition, we recognize that robust governance—encompassing internal-control frameworks, legal and regulatory compliance (including export and data-privacy requirements), and effective risk-assessment and financial-reporting processes—is essential to preserving organizational integrity and flexibility in extreme or exceptional conditions and to ensuring our ability to maintain positive adjustment and performance even under adverse or unexpected circumstances.

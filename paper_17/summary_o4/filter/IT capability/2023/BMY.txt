Bristol-Myers Squibb discloses that it maintains organizational resilience by requiring critical suppliers and alliance partners to deploy business continuity plans in the event of crisis and by monitoring inventory levels and out-movement data to limit channel stocks to expected demand, thereby preserving supply chain continuity amid disruptions such as pandemics, natural disasters, geopolitical events, or regulatory delays. The company regularly assesses working capital needs, debt and leverage ratios, debt maturities, capital expenditures, dividend policies, share repurchase capacity and acquisition financing to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions, including suspension of share repurchases as market conditions warrant. It supports operational flexibility through a $5 billion revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and planned debt issuances, ensuring adequate liquidity access and lower cost of capital. Governance processes—such as formal review and certification of SEC filings, establishment of a business risk and disclosure group and engagement of third-party consultants to re-engineer accounting and reporting processes—help manage risks, monitor compliance with consent orders and enhance system integrity. Operational continuity is further bolstered by rigorous compliance with current good manufacturing practices, chain-of-custody controls for novel therapies, information technology security measures, and the dynamic adaptation of selling, general and administrative expenses through restructuring and integration initiatives, all of which support the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functionality and adjust positively under challenging conditions.

The company’s 10-K disclosures recognize that the integrity and performance of its global operations depend significantly on a complex, predominantly outsourced supply chain and on global and regional economic conditions, and that adverse macroeconomic shifts, political events, trade disputes, terrorism, industrial accidents, natural disasters, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, cyber-attacks, labor disputes and other business interruptions can materially disrupt its ability to manufacture, deliver products and maintain services.  It acknowledges that reliance on single or limited sources for critical components can exacerbate the impact of such disruptions, potentially requiring substantial recovery time, significant expenditures to resume operations and risking lost sales.  To mitigate these risks and maintain continuity, the company invests in manufacturing process equipment at outsourcing partners, makes prepayments under long-term supply agreements, builds inventory in advance of product announcements, maintains insurance coverage (albeit potentially insufficient), and implements system upgrades, redundancy and disaster recovery planning for its information technology systems.  The company has also deployed security measures—encryption, authentication technologies, multifactor authentication and monitoring—to secure its systems and reduce the impact of unauthorized access.  In its distribution network, the company depends on carriers, wholesalers, retailers, logistics providers and other resellers, and it invests in reseller programs while recognizing that such initiatives may require substantial resources without guaranteed incremental returns.  Finally, the company emphasizes that its ability to sustain competitive advantage and operational flexibility under industry volatility and external pressures depends on timely innovation, significant R&D investment and the successful introduction and transition of new products, services and technologies.

The company’s disclosures describe a comprehensive risk and capital management framework designed to preserve operational flexibility and continuity under both normal and stressed conditions, including policies and procedures for maintaining adequate liquidity for transaction settlement, custody requirements, and lending commitments; routine liquidity stress‐testing and contingency funding plans drawing on working capital, client‐generated cash, and external financing such as FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and brokered certificates of deposit; and the maintenance of backup and recovery infrastructure—comprising geographically dispersed operations, incident management protocols, and routine business continuity and disaster recovery plan testing—to safeguard service continuity and mitigate technology or operational failures. During the rapid short‐term rate increases of 2022 and 2023, the company adapted by reallocating funding sources, utilizing higher‐cost supplemental financing to facilitate client cash realignment into higher‐yielding investments and then reducing its borrowings by approximately 18 percent as realignment activity declined, demonstrating reconfiguration of resources and responsiveness to unexpected market shifts. Capital management practices—including maintaining regulatory capital ratios well above minimums, stress testing across adverse macroeconomic scenarios, and executing a mix of dividends, preferred stock issuances and redemptions, and share repurchases—are intended to support strategic initiatives, absorb potential losses, and return excess capital while preserving financial stability. Governance and oversight of liquidity, market, credit, operational, and compliance risks are exercised through a tiered structure of board-level and executive risk committees and functional subcommittees, each monitoring key risk metrics, scenario analyses, and capital contingency planning, thereby reflecting the firm’s systemic perspective and multifaceted approach to maintaining integrity, performance, and business continuity—what scholars define as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

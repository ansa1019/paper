The company actively manages working capital and inventory levels by adjusting purchasing activity to align with fluctuating demand, while anticipating consumer trends and adapting pricing to address inflationary or deflationary pressures. It emphasizes business continuity planning for potential disruptions such as cyber-attacks, system outages, natural disasters, public health crises, and geopolitical conflicts through redundancy measures, cybersecurity defenses, cloud migrations, and regular system updates and patches to maintain system integrity and rapid recovery. Supplier relationship management, contractual oversight, and responsible sourcing audits are employed to secure product availability and uphold quality standards under supply chain stresses, and risk assessment processes, compliance initiatives, and crisis response procedures covering legal, environmental, regulatory, and labor-related contingencies are maintained to safeguard the company’s reputation, ensure adherence to evolving regulations, and preserve customer and stakeholder confidence, thereby supporting the firm’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure processes, and maintain positive adjustment in challenging conditions.

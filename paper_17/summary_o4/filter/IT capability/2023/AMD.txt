Throughout its risk factors, the company describes reliance on external manufacturing and assembly resources—“we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities, our business could be materially adversely affected”—and warns that any damage to facilities, power outages, water shortages, high heat events or other disruptions may require allocation of reduced product supply among customers. It further discloses that “if essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected,” and that outsourced supply-chain logistics functions may not be fulfilled in accordance with contract terms, potentially disrupting delivery schedules and customer operations. In addition, the company highlights that “global health outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have and may continue to adversely affect our employees, disrupt our business operations and practices, as well those of our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers” and that “public health measures … may cause us to incur additional costs, limit our operations, modify our business practices, diminish employee productivity or disrupt our supply chain.” Business continuity risks also extend to internal systems: the newly upgraded ERP system “may not operate as we expect it to and may cause disruption to our operations, administrative or technical problems, difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls, and interruptions or delays to our sales processes.” Cybersecurity threats constitute further organizational vulnerabilities, as “IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information.” The report also recognizes that “climate change may have a long-term impact on our business” through more frequent and severe natural disasters, water and energy shortages, and evolving regulations that could disrupt operations or increase costs. These disclosures implicitly underscore the company’s need for risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, operational flexibility and strategic response mechanisms to preserve integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

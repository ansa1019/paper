The company’s operational resilience framework incorporates disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect its businesses against natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures and similar events, while acknowledging that such preparations may not fully prevent loss of client data, service interruptions or operational disruptions. It dedicates significant additional resources to modify and enhance information security and controls to mitigate cyber threats, and maintains prudent and conservative investment guidelines for client funds—emphasizing safety of principal, liquidity and diversification—supported by short-term financing arrangements, including a commercial paper program, reverse repurchase agreements and committed revolving credit facilities, to satisfy client funds obligations and manage interest rate cycles through laddered maturities. The company continually upgrades, enhances and expands its solutions and services in response to rapid technological advances and changing client needs, leveraging strategic pillars that drive innovation, service excellence and talent retention to sustain competitive advantage. It also maintains contingency plans for bank failures, secures strong credit ratings to ensure access to liquidity during financial market volatility, impounds client funds in advance to mitigate timing risk, establishes credit quality, maturity and exposure limits for its investment portfolios, and employs derivative instruments when appropriate to manage market, currency and credit risks—all measures that support the preservation or improvement of organizational functioning under internal and external pressures.

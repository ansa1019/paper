Oracle’s annual report underscores that the company must absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging internal and external conditions by operating in rapidly changing economic and technological environments driven by factors outside its control or forecasting ability and by implementing risk mitigation and adaptive strategies to maintain business continuity.  It identifies political unrest, terrorist attacks, public health crises, natural disasters and other sources of uncertainty that can depress IT budgets, delay or cancel customer purchases, and threaten revenue growth and profitability.  It highlights dependence on single-source component vendors and outsourced third-party manufacturing partners, reduced channel diversity and “build-to-order” inventory models, any of which can be disrupted by natural disasters, political unrest or capacity constraints, impairing the supply chain, delaying product shipments and causing excess or obsolete inventories.  It warns that a disruption or failure of highly automated systems, concentrated development and critical business operations in a few geographic areas, or catastrophic events such as earthquakes or fires, could delay sales, cloud service delivery and support, and materially affect operating results.  The report also describes the inherent uncertainty of its “pipeline” forecasting system, unpredictable conversion rates and sales cycles, and the risks in integrating acquired companies and technologies into its cloud and hardware strategies, any of which may impede adaptation to customer needs, competitive pressures and evolving IT models.  In response, Oracle employs strategic initiatives including diversifying cloud offerings, strengthening engineered systems, hedging foreign currency and interest rate exposures, monitoring operations for improprieties, and allocating resources to research and development and customer support services to enhance operational flexibility, system integrity and resilience against extreme and nominal disturbances.

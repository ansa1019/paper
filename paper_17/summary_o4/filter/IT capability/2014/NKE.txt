Within Item 1A – Risk Factors, Nike acknowledges that business disruptions—including natural disasters, climate change, terrorist acts, disease outbreaks, extreme weather conditions and increased freight and transportation costs—can interrupt manufacturing, supply chains and distribution despite business interruption insurance that “may not adequately protect us.” The company notes its dependence on independent contract manufacturers and retailers, warning that “if one or more of our significant suppliers … sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms,” timely product replacement may not be possible, and that difficulties in forecasting consumer preferences can lead to “excess inventories or inventory shortages,” inventory write-downs, shipment delays and weakened brand loyalty. The risk factors further highlight that failure to sustain technical innovation and quality control could harm competitive positioning and that inability to “anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products” may impede revenue growth, illustrating the importance of operational flexibility and adaptation. As a resilience mechanism, Nike “makes substantial use of our futures ordering program” to “minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders, and the risk of non-delivery,” while identifying risks from interruptions in information technology systems, exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, default by financial counterparties, data security breaches and contractor noncompliance, any of which could impair resource allocation, organizational response and performance under pressure. In Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Nike describes strategic initiatives to “make our supply chain a competitive advantage,” improve working capital efficiency, deploy capital effectively and deliver “steady results through effective management of our diversified portfolio,” noting that despite “significant foreign currency headwinds,” it delivered “record revenues and earnings” in fiscal 2014 driven by higher average selling prices, “growth in our higher margin dtc business” and disciplined management of demand creation and overhead expenses. The report further explains that its “foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations” by leveraging natural offsets, currency correlations and hedging instruments, and affirms that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to external financing will be sufficient to maintain business continuity and financial resilience under volatile conditions.

In the “Risk Factors” section, the company discloses that “we are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards,” underscoring the resource allocation, innovation and regulatory adaptation processes that enable the firm to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite intense competition and regulatory pressures. It describes undertaking “various restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success,” including “simplifying our manufacturing plant structure, reducing manufacturing costs and improving gross margins” and “rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics,” reflecting deliberate reconfiguring of operations to maintain performance under financial and market constraints. The report highlights that integrating acquired businesses “requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, quality systems and finance,” illustrating the systemic perspective, inter-organizational collaboration and absorptive capacity needed for resilience. Acknowledging “uncertainty about global economic conditions” and potential disruptions in supplier and customer operations, the text details diversified supply arrangements, accounts receivable factoring programs and uncommitted credit facilities as risk mitigation measures to protect liquidity and ensure continuity. Further, the firm emphasizes its reliance on “information technology systems” that “require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems” and warns of cyber-attack risks, underscoring preparedness and recovery mechanisms. Finally, the commitment to maintain “investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies,” use of financial leverage to “reduce our cost of capital” and preservation of “cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets” collectively function as strategic resilience tools designed to sustain organizational integrity and performance maintenance under both nominal and extreme conditions, in line with the scholarly definition of resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

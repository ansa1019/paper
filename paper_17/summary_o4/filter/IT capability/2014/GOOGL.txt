The Company’s disclosures recognize that its operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect its ability to maintain service continuity and performance under adverse conditions. In particular, it acknowledges that interruption or failure of its information technology and communications systems—vulnerable to natural disasters, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, vandalism, and supplier break-ins—could result in lengthy service interruptions, given that some data centers are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The Company emphasizes that competing successfully depends heavily on its capacity to rapidly deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace, adapt its offerings across multiple platforms and devices, and continue significant investments in research and development, acquisitions, and security measures to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite evolving threats and disruptions. It also highlights manufacturing and supply chain risks—such as quality issues, supplier capacity constraints, raw material shortages, and geo-political events—that may require workaround plans, resource reallocation, and strategic flexibility to sustain operational continuity. In discussing acquisitions and strategic transactions, the Company notes that integration challenges—including diversion of management focus, alignment of controls, cultural integration, and system transitions—have created unforeseen operating difficulties, underscoring the need to reconstitute and reconfigure response trajectories in immediate reaction to disruptive events and toward a resilient future.

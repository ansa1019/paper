Our annual report discloses that our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those arising from rapid growth and expansion, which “places a continuous significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources” and demands ongoing improvements to our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. We acknowledge that failure to effectively manage future growth or to improve our systems and processes “may disrupt existing customer relationships, cause us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our products, or increase our technical support costs,” negatively impacting customer satisfaction and operating results. We rely on licensed third-party technology to support these enhancements and may experience difficulties that could harm business continuity. Our operating results are “likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable,” driven by factors outside our control such as changes in market needs, competitive pressures, and end-customer requirements, highlighting the need for operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration, and accurate risk assessment. We recognize that our limited operating history in a rapidly evolving industry “makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects,” increases the risk of inability to plan for and model future growth, and subjects us to risks “frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies.” We face complex supply chain and manufacturing dependencies on third-party contract manufacturers and sole-source component suppliers, whereby any “manufacturing and logistics disruption,” natural disaster, or regional instability could “severely impair our ability to fulfill orders,” leading to delayed revenue or lost sales opportunities. We manage forecasts of future demand to procure components on a non-cancelable basis, yet “insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.” We also note the importance of maintaining “effective sales incentive programs” and channel partner performance to ensure distribution resilience, and we recognize that defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products or updates “could result in damage to our reputation, loss of channel partners, end-customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem, and costly litigation,” requiring significant reallocation of resources to correct or work around issues. Finally, we emphasize the ongoing commitment of substantial resources to research and development and to rapidly introduce new products and enhancements “to respond to new threats,” as our competitive position and future growth depend on our ability to adapt, innovate, and sustain operations under evolving internal and external pressures.

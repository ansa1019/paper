The Company discloses that its business continuity and disaster recovery plans are intended to preserve system integrity and maintain performance under adverse conditions but may not be fully effective in the event of catastrophic events, underscoring the need to adapt operations and reconstitute trajectories of service delivery when disrupted. It identifies volatile and uncertain global economic and geopolitical conditions that undermine forecasting, client demand and resource planning, requiring continual rebalancing of its global workforce, redeployment of skills across multiple delivery centers and adjustment of compensation and hiring levels to absorb strain and preserve functionality. The firm’s cost-management and resource-allocation strategies—including the use of lower-cost locations, involuntary terminations, currency hedging and contract provisions—are designed to mitigate risks, maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and protect profitability when pressures arise. Reliance on complex information-technology networks, third-party vendors and cyber-security controls exposes the organization to internal and external disturbances, prompting the implementation of risk-mitigation mechanisms, alliance partnerships and monitoring of system failures to safeguard ongoing operations. The 10-K also highlights the necessity of strategic investments in emerging technologies, service innovation and transformation initiatives to respond effectively to rapid industry change and competitive consolidation, thereby strengthening the Company’s ability to absorb external shocks and emerge stronger. Contractual structures that permit clients to reduce or terminate services on short notice further demand organizational flexibility and robust client-relationship management to limit revenue volatility. Finally, the Company emphasizes the critical role of its internal control framework, legal and regulatory compliance processes and governance structures as systemic tools for detecting, responding to and recovering from unexpected events at all hierarchical levels, reinforcing its capacity to maintain continuity and performance under internal or external perturbations.

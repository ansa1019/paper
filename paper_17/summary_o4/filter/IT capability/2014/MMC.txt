The company’s disclosures emphasize its capacity to maintain positive adjustment and preserve functioning under adverse conditions through robust risk management, business continuity and disaster recovery frameworks. Should the firm “experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations,” and a failure to recover successfully “could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.” To mitigate such risks, “we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession,” protect our “technology infrastructure against damage from events that could have a significant disruptive effect,” and acknowledge that “we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients in a disaster recovery scenario.” The company further recognizes that “improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data…could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm,” that “our testing efforts may not discover all system deficiencies,” and that “our policies, procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent improper access to or disclosure or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information,” whether by human error, vendor breakdowns or cyber-attacks. Operational flexibility and adaptability to rapid technological change are also vital, since “our businesses face rapid technological changes and our failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes or to successfully implement strategic initiatives to address them could adversely affect our business and results of operations.” The company’s global footprint and significant non-U.S. operations expose it to “exchange rate fluctuations and various risks,” including evolving “data privacy and cyber security” regulations, trade sanctions, political and economic pressures, and constraints on cash repatriation, all of which require ongoing risk assessment, resource reallocation and strategic response mechanisms to uphold performance. Its risk and insurance services segment delivers “risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions) as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services,” using “case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analyses to estimate potential losses,” while its consulting segment provides “actuarial, consulting and administration services relating to defined benefit pension plans,” involving “assumptions and estimates concerning contingent future events” and necessitating periodic “reassessment of funding requirements” to prevent performance impairment and preserve organizational health. Financial resilience is managed through diversified capital markets access, maintenance of credit facilities subject to coverage and leverage covenants, proactive monitoring of credit ratings to avoid higher financing costs, and pension funding strategies that include negotiated deficit recovery plans, plan curtailments and transitions to defined contribution arrangements. The firm’s acquisition and disposition activities involve “special risks…difficulties in integrating acquired businesses,” contingent consideration arrangements and ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, all of which demand strategic agility, real-time reconfiguration of resources and systemic coherence. Collectively, these measures reflect the organization’s commitment to “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” by absorbing strain, mitigating hazards and preserving or improving functioning in both nominal and exceptional circumstances.

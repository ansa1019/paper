The report emphasizes that it is “not possible to predict or identify all” risk factors facing the company, highlighting the need for adaptable planning and resource reallocation when unforeseen market, regulatory or operational challenges arise.  It describes how the Company has responded to the launch of competing products by providing “significant discounts or rebates to public and private payers in order to obtain formulary status or to expand access,” illustrating dynamic pricing strategies and operational flexibility under external pressures.  Demand for new products such as Sovaldi and Harvoni is noted to depend on reimbursement policies and formulary coverage, creating uncertainty in forecasting that the Company manages through ongoing negotiations with payers and by adjusting its discount and rebate structures.  The disclosures discuss manufacturing and supply‐chain vulnerabilities—“many of our products…are made at only one facility” or by third‐party manufacturers and contract research organizations—and recognize that disruptions or regulatory inspections could delay production or shipments, underscoring the importance of business continuity, contingency planning and capacity reconfiguration.  The report also details how government budgetary and purchasing fluctuations, particularly in southern Europe and non‐retail sectors, have “caused…fluctuations in our product sales, revenues and earnings,” requiring the Company to monitor external funding cycles and adjust its working capital and inventories accordingly.  Healthcare reform initiatives, evolving drug pricing legislation and the branded prescription drug fee compel regular risk assessment, strategic response and mitigation measures.  A broad range of litigation and intellectual property disputes, including interference and infringement actions, are described as ongoing drains on resources and as challenges to the Company’s ability to maintain product lines, necessitating legal defenses and collaboration with patent offices worldwide.  The report warns of reliance on information technology systems that are “vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack,” stressing the importance of infrastructure resilience, data security programs and recovery mechanisms.  Finally, the Company acknowledges the risk of natural or man‐made disasters—“our headquarters and…manufacturing facilities…are located in a seismically active region” without earthquake insurance—which could require “significant recovery time” to resume operations, illustrating the need for emergency management planning.  Together, these disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions that encompasses strategic agility, resource reconfiguration, inter‐organizational collaboration and operational continuity in the face of uncertainty, disruptions and external pressures.

Berkshireâ€™s board has developed and continues to monitor a succession plan identifying capable subsidiary managers to succeed key personnel, which, together with outstanding managers running its numerous and highly diversified operating units, helps mitigate the risk of dependency on a few key decision-makers. In its decentralized model, each operating subsidiary must recruit, retain and deploy qualified, competent management and personnel to direct day-to-day activities, execute business plans and serve stakeholders, and changes in demographics, training requirements or unexpected demand increases could adversely impact its ability to meet customer needs. We rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business, and although significant disruptions or cyber intrusions could lead to service interruptions, safety failures, security violations and other operational difficulties, we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis. Our senior corporate management team remains responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities, chief executive selection, tone-at-the-top communication, governance monitoring across hierarchical levels and resolution of governance-related issues, ensuring organizational health and flexibility under emerging pressures. Our railroad and utilities businesses continually make significant capital investments to expand capacity, improve system reliability and address service-related challenges, and forecast aggregate capital expenditures funded from operations and debt to maintain operational continuity and performance under environmental and economic disturbances. Financing subsidiaries regularly access credit markets to fund acquisitions and operations, and substantial liquidity is maintained to preserve integrity and competitive advantage even under constrained market conditions. Forward-looking statements caution that our operations are subject to external pressures, including regulatory changes, economic cycles, commodity price fluctuations and geopolitical events, which may require adaptive strategies, resource reconfiguration and proactive risk mitigation to preserve or enhance functioning under adverse conditions.

Our 10-K disclosures describe a range of operational and strategic initiatives and risk-mitigation processes that collectively support our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. For example, we acknowledge that “our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks,” including the risk that if “we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum before reaching capacity” we may be “at a competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service” that would impair customer retention and financial performance. In the area of cybersecurity, we note that “the ever-evolving threats require us to continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes” and that failure to prevent a “significant attack or breach” could disrupt internal systems, “impair our ability to provide services,” incur remediation costs and reputational damage. We also recognize the dependency on suppliers and third parties: “disruptions with respect to such suppliers, or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance,” and during our “initial stages of implementing a new customer billing system … any unanticipated difficulties, disruption or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects,” requiring parallel operations to “aid in the transition.” Continuing technology evolution drives our need “to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings,” yet we concede that “scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints … could cause delays in launching new network capabilities, which could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades.” Financial flexibility and leverage are also central to resilience, as we explain that “restrictive covenants” in our debt agreements “could limit our ability to react to changes in our operating environment or the economy” and that our “significant indebtedness could … limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business.” We further disclose that “economic and market conditions may adversely affect our business and financial performance” and that fluctuating consumer confidence and credit conditions “have contributed to market volatility and economic uncertainty.” In our risk-management and liquidity strategies, we maintain “an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments,” periodically “assess the need for and recognize an allowance for credit losses” on installment receivables, and have entered into “factoring arrangements to sell certain service accounts receivable” to bolster liquidity. We invest heavily in network resilience, completing the build-out of our LTE network to cover 265 million people and targeting 300 million by 2015, with “cash capital expenditures for property and equipment … in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion in 2015,” and we continue to “opportunistically acquire additional spectrum” to strengthen our resource base. Our critical accounting policies likewise incorporate forward-looking judgments—such as “comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount” in goodwill impairment tests and using a “greenfield approach” to test spectrum license carrying values—ensuring that our financial statements reflect changes in market conditions. Together, these disclosures reflect a multifaceted set of organizational capabilities, strategic tools, resource deployments and adaptive processes designed to maintain operational continuity, manage emerging threats and reposition the company to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

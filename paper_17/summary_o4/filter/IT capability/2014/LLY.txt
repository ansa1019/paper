The Company’s risk disclosures acknowledge that manufacturing difficulties or disruptions at its facilities or those of contract manufacturers—arising from quality or regulatory compliance problems, natural disasters or inability to obtain sole-source raw materials—could result in product shortages and lost revenue, and that system inadequacies or operating failures in its complex information technology systems and networks—vulnerable to energy or telecommunications failures, natural disasters, terrorism, malware or other malicious intrusions—could harm the business despite extensive measures to prevent, respond to, and minimize the impact of interruptions. It further recognizes that reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing for product development, manufacturing, commercialization and information-technology support creates operational risks if third parties fail to perform to required standards or meet contractual, regulatory or confidentiality obligations. In the face of intense competition, rising regulatory hurdles and pricing or reimbursement pressures—including rapid revenue declines upon loss of patent exclusivity—the Company emphasizes the need to maintain a continuous flow of innovative, cost-effective products and new indications sufficient to cover substantial research and development costs and replace sales lost to generics. The management’s discussion and analysis describes the inherently high failure rate of pharmaceutical research and development and explains that R&D spending is managed across a broad portfolio so that delays or terminations of individual projects will not materially affect total spending, reflecting a systemic diversification strategy. To mitigate financial risks, the Company uses derivative instruments to hedge interest-rate and foreign-currency exposures, maintains a balanced mix of fixed and floating rate debt, and offsets currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities to stabilize cash flows. It also reviews the carrying value of indefinite-lived and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable, adjusting them to fair value when necessary. The report notes that cash flow from operations, investment transactions and planned repatriations of foreign earnings are expected to fund domestic operating needs, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures, thereby supporting business continuity and strategic resource deployment under challenging conditions. Finally, it highlights that the integration of the acquired Novartis Animal Health business is complex and potentially disruptive, where unexpected delays or difficulties could impede achievement of intended operational efficiencies and synergies, underscoring the importance of effective change management, operational flexibility and strategic resilience in maintaining organizational integrity and performance.

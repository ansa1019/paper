The Company’s risk factors and related disclosures describe multiple strategies and resource commitments intended to preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, including their acknowledgment that “disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations,” potentially delaying customer orders, impeding accurate forecasting and access to external financing, and prompting restructuring charges or asset impairments under deteriorating economic conditions. They highlight the importance of operational flexibility in managing cost structures “in both the short term and over a longer duration,” the need for adaptable inventory and capacity management given the semiconductor market’s cyclical nature, and reliance on third‐party suppliers that may force the Company “to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers” to avoid production delays. The disclosures also address the complexity of their manufacturing processes—where “instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages”—and emphasize investments in product testing and quality management to mitigate defect‐related risks. Information technology is identified as critical infrastructure susceptible to “damage, disruptions or shutdowns” that could lead to loss of sales, while their human capital disclosures underscore that failure “to retain our key personnel” would undermine execution of business strategy. The Company further describes use of acquisitions, credit facilities, cash and short‐term investments, and dividend and stock repurchase programs as financial resilience tools to ensure ongoing resource availability, reflecting their systemic approach to absorb strain and maintain continuity, adaptability, and performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

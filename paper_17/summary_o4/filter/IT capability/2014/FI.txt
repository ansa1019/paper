The Company acknowledges that an operational failure in its transaction processing businesses, including its business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, could materially harm its business, damage its reputation, or cause the loss of clients. In the same vein, security breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks may disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or those of our clients and vendors, and we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security controls or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities. Our ability to adapt our products and services to constant technological changes, evolving marketplace demands and industry standards, and to develop and introduce innovative solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers, will significantly affect our future success; failures or delays in these efforts could result in client attrition or hinder new business development. We also recognize that adverse U.S. and global market and economic conditions, including prolonged downturns in the financial services industry, may reduce demand for our offerings and transaction volumes, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition. Strict compliance with applicable federal, state and international regulations, as well as contractual requirements imposed by financial institution clients, is critical to avoid breach of contract suits, regulatory proceedings or fines, preserve client relationships and maintain our ability to obtain new business. Acquisition activities expose us to risks such as increased indebtedness, unforeseen liabilities and difficulties in integrating operations, any of which may disrupt our business and divert resources, while our disciplined allocation of capital, active portfolio management, operational effectiveness initiatives and ongoing strategic initiatives to enhance client relationships and differentiate our products through innovation are designed to strengthen our resilience. We anticipate benefiting over the long term from financial institutions’ trend toward outsourcing technology and digital channels, leveraging our economies of scale in infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks to create revenue opportunities and support operational flexibility. We employ our operating cash flow— which increased to $1.3 billion in 2014, reflecting higher earnings and favorable working capital changes—to repay debt, fund capital expenditures, pursue acquisitions and support share repurchases, all while maintaining compliance with our debt covenants. Our continued access to capital through our revolving credit facility, term loan and senior notes, subject to credit rating adjustments, further underpins our liquidity and capacity to preserve operational continuity under both nominal and stress conditions.

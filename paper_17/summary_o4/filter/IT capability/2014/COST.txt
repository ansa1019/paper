In its 2014 Form 10-K, the company discloses that it mitigates internal and external pressures and preserves operational integrity by absorbing strain through diversified resource allocation, structured risk assessment, and contingency planning. It emphasizes business continuity via the orderly operation of merchandise receiving and distribution processes and the maintenance of primary and back-up computer systems, reinforced by ongoing technology investments and change management processes to address power outages, security breaches, and other system disruptions. Supply-chain resilience is supported by multiple vendor relationships and provisions for labor disputes, natural disasters, and logistical constraints, while inventory and purchasing strategies are adapted to emerging consumer trends to avoid excess stock and margin erosion. The company manages hazards related to catastrophic events, public health issues, and climate change through insurance, self-insurance captives, credit facilities, and contractual commitments, thereby safeguarding its financial condition and liquidity. Strategic agility is demonstrated by adjustments to pricing, merchandise mix, multichannel retail platforms, and warehouse expansion plans to respond to competitive landscapes and economic variability, and human-capital resilience is underpinned by targeted recruitment, training, and benefit programs. Overall, these practices reflect the firmâ€™s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and reconfigure its operations to support ongoing growth objectives.

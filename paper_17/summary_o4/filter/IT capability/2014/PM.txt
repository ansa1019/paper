We identify a diverse set of internal and external pressures—economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters, conflicts or regime changes—that could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, lead to property loss or equipment damage, complicate staffing and cost management, and materially affect volumes, revenues and net earnings, underscoring our need to absorb strain and sustain functioning under adversity. To mitigate these risks, we maintain backup systems and business continuity plans, deploy information systems to manage processes, data and communications, and retain the flexibility to replace third-party manufacturers or service providers with internal resources. We monitor tax regimes, competitive actions, consumer trend shifts and regulatory requirements, such as restrictions on advertising, packaging, health warnings and product formats, and implement strategic initiatives including pricing adjustments, product portfolio diversification, innovation in reduced-risk products, asset impairment and exit cost management—as evidenced by factory closures and restructuring in the Netherlands, Australia and Canada—to preserve performance and reconfigure resources under challenging conditions. We analyze volume, product and geographic mix, currency exposures and asset impairment charges, and define adjusted diluted EPS—excluding impairment, discrete tax and unusual items—to assess core operational results and trends. Our forward-looking guidance, which incorporates prudent assumptions about currency, market expansion plans and increased spending on reduced-risk products, is subject to the ongoing risks identified in our Item 1A risk factors and excludes unanticipated impairment, exit-cost charges or currency fluctuations, reflecting our trajectory model of response planning under volatile conditions.

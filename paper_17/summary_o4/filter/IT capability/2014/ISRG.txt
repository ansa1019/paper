The company’s risk disclosures describe a multifaceted resilience framework in which it strives to maintain business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by deploying credit risk monitoring and mitigation programs to address customer and supplier financing constraints, hedging foreign currency exposures to offset exchange‐rate volatility, and establishing contingency plans for sole‐source suppliers and manufacturing disruptions—such as alternative sourcing, quality control and assurance processes, corrective and preventive actions, and field corrections or recalls to manage product defects. It highlights investments in internal knowledge and training of surgical teams to sustain operational flexibility, the expansion of service agreements and remote support systems for rapid recovery, and the continuous refinement of its quality management system and regulatory compliance capabilities to adapt to changing standards and unexpected events. The company further addresses resilience to external pressures—ranging from global economic downturns, health care reimbursement shifts and competitive advances to natural disasters, cybersecurity threats and pandemic‐related hospital disruptions—through robust cash generation, diversified revenue streams, prudent liquidity management, self‐insurance of certain risks and strategic acquisitions and integrations to reconfigure resources and capabilities. Finally, its approach to legal contingencies—employing tolling agreements, mediation efforts and accruals for probable loss—alongside decentralized geographic operations and targeted research and development investments, reflects a systemic perspective on risk assessment, resource allocation and organizational evolution to preserve performance and emerge stronger from adversity.

We have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. To handle the increase in end customers, we expect to continue to grow our headcount significantly over the next 12 months, increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. To manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems. We may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner, and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with third-party technology, and our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud. Our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner, may result in disruption of our current operations and end-customer relationships, our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses. We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time; it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers over whom we have limited control and no guaranteed supply contracts, which exposes us to risks of supply shortages or interruptions, quality control problems, price fluctuations and the inability to satisfy end-customer orders in a timely or cost-effective manner. Breaches of our or our partnersâ€™ cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services, compromise the integrity of our software products, result in significant data losses and theft of our intellectual property, damage our reputation, expose us to liability and require significant additional costs to maintain network and data security. Our corporate headquarters and many of our service providers are located in areas exposed to natural disasters and other catastrophic events; in the event of an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or disease outbreak, shipments could be delayed or canceled, end customers may delay or forego purchases and our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers, logistics providers or partners may prove to be inadequate, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

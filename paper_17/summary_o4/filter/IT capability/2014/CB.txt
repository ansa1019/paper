Recognizing that exposures to natural and man-made disasters, pandemics, and cyber-attacks could materially impair business operations, the company has implemented a disciplined underwriting process supported by risk models and analytical decision-making tools in underwriting, claims, reserving, and catastrophe risk management, established reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses through collaborative multi-disciplinary actuarial reviews and reserve committees, and limited loss exposure through underwriting controls, structured excess of loss and proportional reinsurance programs, geographic diversification, program size limits, collateral agreements, and letters of credit. To ensure operational flexibility and business continuity under unexpected situations, management maintains highly liquid and duration-matched investment portfolios, multi-currency notional cash pooling programs, secured credit facilities subject to covenants, share repurchase and dividend distribution mechanisms, and probabilistic modeling of U.S. hurricane and California earthquake probable maximum loss, while continuously updating security measures, administrative and technical controls, and vendor agreements to address cyber-security and infrastructure disruptions. Furthermore, the company monitors reinsurer creditworthiness, actively pursues recoveries, negotiates collateral support, and conducts in-depth reviews of policyholder behavior under derivative-based variable annuity reinsurance to adapt assumptions and mitigate the impact of environmental turbulence, thereby preserving system integrity, adaptability, and performance maintenance in the face of adverse conditions.

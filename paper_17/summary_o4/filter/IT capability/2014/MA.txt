Mastercard maintains an information security program that is reviewed by our board of directors, a business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, and processing systems that incorporate multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks, and we also test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities. We are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees in regulatory proceedings, litigation and legislative activity, and acknowledge that regulators in several jurisdictions increasingly have been leveraging or seeking to establish the authority to regulate certain aspects of payment systems such as ours, which may require us and our customers to adjust our strategies accordingly. In addition to policies, procedures and controls designed to comply with applicable AML and OFAC sanctions requirements, we have a revolving credit facility in the amount of $3 billion which could be used for general corporate purposes, including to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers, and we guarantee the settlement of many Mastercard, Cirrus and Maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks, and our business strategy includes ongoing investments to modify or enhance protective measures, comply with evolving privacy, data protection and security regulations, and adopt new technologies and industry-wide standards. Although our transaction processing systems and other key service offerings may experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions, natural disasters, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism or cyber-attacks, and despite our business continuity program, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks, and any such interruption could materially reduce our results of operations. Moreover, our ability to attract and retain cardholders and support our global payments industry depends on close collaboration with issuers, acquirers, merchants and regulators to manage brand perception, adjust incentive programs, and introduce innovative servicesâ€”all of which must be continuously reconfigured to preserve our performance and integrity in the face of external disturbances, competitive and economic pressures, and evolving regulatory requirements.

The company maintains business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials to mitigate disruptions from labor disputes, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors; it relies on relationships with suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and external business partners under formal policies and procedures to manage inherent operational, legal, reputational and financial risks; it must obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protections and respond to technological advances by competitors to preserve competitive advantage; the ongoing management of acquisitions, divestitures and workforce optimization projects, including the retention and development of key employees in core markets, is deemed critical to sustaining leadership, executing strategic initiatives and delivering productivity improvements; the ability to maintain key information technology systems, networks, processes and security controls—some managed by third parties—and to implement effective business continuity plans for catastrophic events, power outages or cybersecurity breaches is recognized as essential to uninterrupted operations; price and cost fluctuations in commodities, raw materials, labor, energy, pension and healthcare costs, and foreign exchange rates are managed through pricing actions, cost-saving projects, sourcing decisions, productivity and cost savings plans and hedging strategies; the company actively evaluates market risks related to interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices on a centralized basis, taking advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting; it seeks to preserve financial flexibility through strong credit ratings, diverse debt facilities and ready access to capital markets; the company’s disclosures of forward-looking statements, risk factors and its assumption of no obligation to update such statements underscore the need for agile response and adaptation to evolving economic conditions, regulatory changes, political volatility, supply chain interruptions, shifts in consumer demand and competitive pressures; these practices collectively reflect its capacity to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under adversity and maintain integrity and performance across nominal, extreme or exceptional internal or external variations.

Visa maintains comprehensive policies, procedures, systems and controls designed to identify, monitor and mitigate risks—from anti-money laundering and operating regulation compliance to credit settlement exposures and litigation liabilities—while preserving business continuity through a litigation escrow account under its retrospective responsibility plan, a hedging program to offset currency fluctuations, and regular evaluation of cash requirements for operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures. The company secures liquidity and operational flexibility via cash on hand, an investment portfolio of readily marketable securities, a commercial paper program and an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility, and it anticipates funding defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in accordance with assessed discount rates and plan‐asset performance. Visa invests in technology assets, processing network infrastructure and global payments platforms to support growth initiatives, digital solutions and system interoperability, uses client incentive arrangements and long-term marketing and sponsorship commitments to drive volume and acceptance, and employs a dynamic governance framework that empowers management to assess opportunities and risks, deploy resources, adapt organizational processes and respond promptly to disruptive regulatory changes, litigation outcomes, technological developments and market volatility. The company also manages merger, acquisition and integration activities, succession planning and global-local decision-making processes to ensure organizational effectiveness, strategic agility and the maintenance of performance under challenging conditions.

In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NEE and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their business and any inability or failure to do so adequately could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. FPL is a regulated entity subject to the jurisdiction of the FPSC over a wide range of business activities, including retail rates and cost recovery clauses, and the FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery by FPL of costs it considers excessive or imprudently incurred and to determine the level of return permitted on invested capital. Regulatory decisions may require FPL to cancel or delay planned development activities, reduce or delay capital expenditures or incur non-recoverable costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect. NEE and FPL cannot predict the impact of changing FERC rules or the effect of wholesale supply and demand, and cannot assure they will be able to respond adequately or sufficiently quickly to such rules and developments. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for substantially increased regulation of the OTC derivatives market and, if final rules on mandatory margin require posting significant amounts of cash collateral, NEE’s and FPL’s liquidity could be materially adversely affected. NEE’s and FPL’s business is influenced by various legislative and regulatory initiatives, including deregulation and environmental regulation, and they are unable to predict future changes that may increase costs or competitive pressures. The operations of NEE and FPL are subject to many operational risks, including escalations in fuel and labor costs, equipment breakdown, facility start-up uncertainties, supply interruptions and the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes, which can be destructive and cause power outages and property damage, forcing NEE and FPL to incur additional costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities subject to regulatory approval. Threats of terrorism, cyber attacks or other disruptive activities could limit their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power, delay development of new facilities, harm critical information technology systems and impair their ability to raise capital, and implementation of increased security guidelines has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in additional costs. Modifying or replacing information systems is costly and involves integration, data conversion and control risks, and any disruptions or deficiencies could increase costs, impede revenue tracking, divert management’s attention and negatively impact the effectiveness of the control environment. NEE and FPL rely on derivative instruments to manage commodity price and interest rate risks, but their hedging and trading procedures and risk management tools may not protect against significant losses if price movements deviate from historical patterns, and reductions in energy market liquidity may further restrict their ability to mitigate these risks. Disruptions or volatility in the credit and capital markets may increase their cost of capital or restrict their access to funding, which in turn could delay capital investments, limit growth and adversely affect liquidity, while an inability to maintain current credit ratings or to post required collateral could further impair their financial flexibility. NEE’s and FPL’s ability to service customers and sustain operations also depends on maintaining an appropriately skilled workforce, having insurance coverage, securing regulatory approvals, completing construction projects on schedule and within budget, and ensuring the availability of third-party transmission and fuel transportation facilities; failures in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on NEE’s and FPL’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Starbucks operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment where new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operation, and if any of the risks and uncertainties described actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected; any material interruption in our supply chain, such as casualty loss of roasting plants, interruptions in service by third party logistics providers, trade restrictions or natural disasters, could affect our ability to produce or deliver products and negatively impact our profitability; we rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology, including cyber‐attacks, could harm our ability to effectively operate and could adversely affect our financial results, notwithstanding significant capital investments and other expenditures to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate cyber‐attacks and prevent breaches of our information technology systems or data loss; if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results; growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high‐quality raw materials, to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high‐quality product and customer experience; we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of our business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control; business incidents that erode consumer trust, such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy, contaminated food, recalls or other potential incidents, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results; market risk, including changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates, is managed according to a market price risk management policy involving pricing features within supply contracts and the use of hedging instruments, such as fixed‐price and price‐to‐be‐fixed contracts and financial derivatives for coffee and dairy procurement; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including trade, labor, healthcare, privacy, food, anti‐bribery and corruption requirements, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements; our borrowing arrangements and indentures require compliance with covenants on liens, sale and leaseback transactions and certain financial ratios, and we actively manage our cash and investments to internally fund operating needs, scheduled interest and principal payments, dividends and share repurchases, including liquidating offshore investments in anticipation of funding strategic acquisitions; and we face extraordinary external pressures, such as labor discord, war, terrorism, political instability, boycotts, social unrest and natural disasters including health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings, all of which require the allocation of significant financial and operational resources to mitigate adverse impacts and preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

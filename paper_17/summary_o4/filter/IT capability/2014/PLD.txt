Prologis has committed substantial resources to expand and manage its global platform, deploying robust internal controls, cross-regional operating procedures and scenario-based planning to preserve business continuity and positive adjustment under social, political or economic pressures across its international operations. The company maintains geographical, sectoral and currency diversification of its real estate portfolio and conducts annual evaluations of earthquake, hurricane, flood and terrorism insurance—supplemented by self-insurance where commercially reasonable—and uses derivative contracts and debt denominated in functional currencies to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, thereby absorbing strain and retaining or improving functioning despite internal or external disturbances. To address liquidity constraints and extreme market disruptions, Prologis employs resource reallocation mechanisms such as strategic dispositions, contributions to co-investment ventures, debt refinancing, equity issuances under its “at-the-market” program and alternative funding arrangements, and, when necessary, divestitures or lease renegotiations at less than optimal terms. The firm actively manages capital commitments and covenant requirements on its credit facilities and co-investment venture equity calls, ensuring operational flexibility by maintaining borrowing capacity, refinancing maturing debt, and adjusting its development and acquisition activities in response to evolving market conditions. Performance monitoring tools—such as same-store analyses, net operating income, FFO and core FFO—guide resource deployment, strategic foresight and risk mitigation, while continuous review of tax structures, consolidation criteria and critical accounting judgments supports organizational intelligence, systemic integrity and the ability to reconfigure trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events.

In its 2014 Form 10-K, Stryker Corporation describes numerous strategies, resources and potential risks that bear on the firm’s capacity to maintain operations and performance under adverse conditions in a manner consistent with organizational resilience. The company acknowledges that “macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in affected regions” and that “financial difficulties experienced by our customers, including distributors, and suppliers could result in product delays and inventory issues,” highlighting its exposure to external pressures and the need for risk mitigation. It notes its reliance on information technology systems for critical business processes and warns that “if our systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes … and our business continuity plans do not effectively compensate on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our operations,” alongside investments in cybersecurity—including “monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies”—to preserve system integrity and data availability. To manage currency variability, the company “enters into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations,” while its global cash management strategy ensures liquidity through operating cash flow, supplemental debt and disciplined capital allocation for acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, thereby supporting ongoing resource generation and deployment. Stryker continually evaluates receivables in higher-risk regions and maintains reserves it deems adequate “so any additional credit risk … is not expected to have a material adverse impact.” It maintains appropriate debt levels “after evaluating … cash flow expectations, … investment and financing plans … and overall cost of capital” and reports no off-balance-sheet financing “of a magnitude … that could have a material impact.” Regarding regulatory and legal contingencies, the firm discloses accrued charges for product recalls, noting “the actuarially determined range of probable loss to resolve this matter … is estimated … and the final outcome … is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict,” and recognizes exposures from healthcare regulations, product liability, intellectual property litigation and FDA compliance that could trigger sanctions, recalls or manufacturing suspensions. The company’s commitment to internal innovation—“to develop products … that improve outcomes and deliver greater cost savings and efficiencies”—and the establishment of separate dedicated sales forces and expanded regional headquarters are presented as means to strengthen competitive advantage, operational efficiencies and strategic flexibility in a turbulent market environment. Finally, Stryker’s critical accounting policies address estimation uncertainties in inventory reserves, tax positions, goodwill and intangible asset valuations, reflecting the firm’s structured approach to assessing risk and maintaining performance under pressure.

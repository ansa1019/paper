The report describes how the Company maintains positive adjustment under challenging conditions by centralizing funding and liquidity risk management to ensure business continuity throughout market cycles, preserving excess liquidity in the form of cash and high‐quality, liquid, unencumbered securities at both the parent company and regulated subsidiaries and diversifying funding sources; by conducting rigorous stress testing and contingency planning that project contractual and contingent outflows under varying severity scenarios, match potential cash requirements with available sources on a legal‐entity basis and monitor a time‐to‐required‐funding metric to gauge the ability to meet obligations without new debt issuance; by proactively managing credit risk through disciplined underwriting, risk‐rating frameworks, concentration limits, collateral practices and loss mitigation initiatives such as loan modifications and workout strategies; by quantifying and controlling market risks via value‐at‐risk, sensitivity analyses, limit structures, model validation and backtesting processes to ensure adherence to approved risk appetites; by employing asset and liability management derivatives to hedge interest-rate, prepayment and foreign-exchange exposures; by embedding operational risk governance in a three-line-of-defense framework with independent risk management and corporate audit oversight, using risk and control self-assessments, loss event reporting, scenario analysis and business recovery planning to maintain system integrity; and by periodically evaluating capital adequacy and allocating capital to businesses based on risk‐adjusted return models, all of which collectively support the Company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of internal and external variations and disturbances.

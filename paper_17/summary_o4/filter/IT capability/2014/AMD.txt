The Company also executed a cost-rebalancing initiative, reducing global headcount by approximately 6% and rationalizing its real estate footprint to generate operating efficiencies and improve resource allocation and operational flexibility.  To safeguard business continuity in the face of supplier or manufacturing disruptions, AMD maintains long-term wafer supply agreements with third-party foundries, negotiates annual purchase commitments, and relies on a network of third-party wafer foundries and assembly, test and packaging partners while continuously evaluating their capacity, quality and reliability to ensure adequate product supply and timely response to customer demand.  Financially, the Company has reprofiled its debt maturity schedule through the issuance of senior notes, repurchase of existing debt and establishment of a secured revolving credit facility, and it holds cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities intended to preserve system integrity and fund its ongoing investments in research and development despite external pressures.

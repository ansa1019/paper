The company acknowledges that its operations rely on robust information technology and network systems and that business continuity may be disrupted by unanticipated system failures, data corruption, infrastructure or network outages, malicious software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party providers or increased government regulation; although disaster recovery plans and backup facilities exist, the systems are not always fully redundant, and the disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. It recognizes that operational disruptions due to infrastructure or technological malfunctions—whether from human error, sabotage, vandalism, terrorism, political unrest or force majeure events—could impede personnel’s ability to service clients, interfere with electronic delivery of products and services and materially and adversely affect the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The company maintains policies, processes and internal controls intended to ensure IT stability and security and manage cybersecurity risks, but acknowledges that measures to avoid or mitigate breaches may be insufficient or become obsolete, potentially resulting in material interruptions, reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory sanctions, litigation or financial losses. It continuously reviews and assesses legal and regulatory risks arising from litigation, government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, recognizing that additional investigations or adverse outcomes may require recording contingent liabilities in future periods. The transition of financial processing systems and outsourcing of support functions is managed with risk assessment and mitigation processes, yet the company admits that inadequate performance by third-party service providers could lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies or harm to employee morale. Moreover, its expanding cross-border operations confront external pressures such as currency conversion restrictions, differing legal and regulatory standards, export and import barriers, political unrest, expropriation risks and anti-corruption laws, all of which the company addresses through compliance controls and continuous evaluation of its ability to adapt and respond effectively.

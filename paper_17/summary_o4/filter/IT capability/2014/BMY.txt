The company cautions that its product supply and patient access could be adversely affected by “disruption in supply chain continuity including from natural or man-made disasters at one of our facilities or at a critical supplier,” and that the failure of any critical third party “to comply with current good manufacturing practices” or to “adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis” could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing and materially impair operations. It similarly recognizes that “a significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure” could negatively impact operations, and has therefore “invested in industry appropriate protections and monitoring practices” and maintains ongoing threat monitoring. To preserve financial flexibility and support operational continuity under adverse conditions, the company believes that its “existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations” will be sufficient to meet normal cash requirements for several years, it periodically evaluates debt repurchase and interest rate swap termination opportunities, actively manages working capital “by focusing on receivables, inventories, and accounts payable,” factors certain receivables to mitigate credit risk, and maintains undrawn revolving credit facilities. In addition, it has established inventory management agreements with wholesalers and a governance process to estimate months-on-hand levels against “expected demand” and limit sales in accordance with distribution channel policies, illustrating its ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve functioning under internal or external pressures.

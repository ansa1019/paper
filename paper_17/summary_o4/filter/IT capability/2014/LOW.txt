“We have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business,” administered by our chief risk officer and including “developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify,” reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal and external disturbances. We recognize that “failure to adapt our business concept successfully could negatively affect … the rate of growth of our business and our market share,” and accordingly we are transforming from a single-channel retailer to an omni-channel home improvement company by “investing extensively in online sales, content marketing and information searching technology capabilities” to meet changing customer demands. Our leadership development program “is focused on aligning processes for corporate strategy, business unit strategy and integrated planning to drive alignment, execution and delivery of solutions, including timely delivery and functionality of new technology solutions,” and our enhanced sales & operations planning process ensures “improved seasonal planning, including the cadence of product introductions, promotions and staffing,” with “collaboration from all functions, including logistics, merchandising and marketing” to provide relevant products at the right time. We maintain and improve our critical information systems supporting inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, transportation, receipt processing and product delivery and have disaster recovery plans in place, acknowledging that “performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems … without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented could quickly destroy the positive benefits” of those systems. Recognizing the evolving cyber-attack threat, we continue to invest in information security while acknowledging that “despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security, we may be unable to adequately anticipate or prevent a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of sensitive data,” which could materially affect our reputation and financial performance. We mitigate supply chain disruption risks by sourcing from over 7,000 vendors and monitoring political, logistical and regulatory factors, and we self-insure for workers’ compensation, general and product liability, and extended protection plan claims, accruing liabilities based on actuarial assumptions. Our liquidity is supported by strong cash flows from operations, a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a $500 million letter of credit sublimit, and continued access to the capital markets, ensuring business continuity under varying market conditions. We forecast approximately $1.4 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2015—investing in store equipment, resets, remerchandising, customer experience enhancements, corporate infrastructure and the opening of 15 to 20 new stores—in order to deploy resources strategically, maintain operational flexibility, and foster resilience as market conditions evolve.

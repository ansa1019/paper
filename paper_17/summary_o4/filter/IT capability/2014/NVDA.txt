Nvidia discloses that business disruptions such as security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters or supplier constraints may interrupt critical operations, requiring substantial recovery expenditures and testing its ability to maintain continuity and integrity of functions under adverse conditions. The company acknowledges its dependency on third-party foundries, subcontractors and software development tools to manufacture, assemble, test and package products, exposing it to risks in capacity allocation, procurement of raw materials, lower manufacturing yields and supply delays that could harm market share and necessitate resource reallocation. It stresses the importance of accurately forecasting customer demand to manage inventory levels, achieving design wins by anticipating evolving market requirements and compliance with industry standards, and controlling product quality to preserve reputation and competitive positioning. Risk mitigation strategies include diversifying and periodically reviewing its investment portfolio under strict credit and duration limits, conducting impairment and stress testing of cash equivalents and marketable securities, maintaining liquidity through substantial cash balances and access to external financing, and safeguarding intellectual property through licensing arrangements and litigation. Ongoing evaluation of capital expenditure plans, allowances for doubtful accounts, and contingent liabilities for litigation and tax positions further illustrate a systemic approach to preserving organizational health, sustaining performance under pressure, and adapting to evolving internal and external challenges.

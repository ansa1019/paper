Lockheed Martin emphasizes identification, management and mitigation of risks to business operations, acknowledging that risk and uncertainty cannot be entirely eliminated, and has developed procedures to maintain continuity of operations when government funding is delayed—at times continuing performance without customer‐approved funding to meet delivery dates. The company seeks to ensure adequate funding by notifying customers when estimated program costs approach allotted levels, and balances a mix of cost-reimbursable, fixed-price, incentive-fee and time-and-materials contracts to address changing risk-reward profiles as programs mature. In response to budget constraints, continuing resolutions and sequestration pressures, Lockheed Martin leverages its diverse backlog and production contract portfolio to attenuate the impact of discretionary spending cuts, recognizes the lagged effect of budget reductions on long-cycle businesses, and adapts its operating structure through facility consolidations, workforce realignments and accelerated depreciation. Supplier and supply-chain resilience measures include monitoring sole-source suppliers—such as the propeller manufacturer impacted by a factory fire for C-130J aircraft—and engaging in indemnification and standby letters of credit to guard against performance disruptions. Facing increased contract fragmentation, price competition and re-competition on existing services programs, the company strives to maintain strong customer relationships, enhance cost control, sustain operational flexibility and tailor advanced technology solutions at affordable prices. To diversify risk and resource dependencies, Lockheed Martin pursues international sales growth via in-country partnerships, joint technology offices and local production arrangements, while complying with complex legal, regulatory and offset requirements. The firm integrates compliance with procurement laws, audit protocols and cost accounting standards—including the recovery of pension contributions through prepayment credits and performance-based payment mechanisms—to preserve cash flows, absorb cost overruns, and reconfigure financial and operational resources so as to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

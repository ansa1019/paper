Throughout the report, the Company describes multiple initiatives and processes designed to anticipate and absorb internal and external pressures, maintain continuity of operations and preserve performance under adversity, including detailed business continuity plans and an information risk management program—supported by investments in personnel, technologies, cyber-insurance and ongoing training—to guard against service interruptions, security breaches and system shutdowns and enable prompt recovery; a robust water stewardship and risk management program that regularly assesses resource constraints, drives efficiency in usage and wastewater treatment, replenishes watersheds and collaborates with governments, NGOs and communities to safeguard raw-material supply and production capacity; measures to mitigate climate-change and extreme-weather impacts on agriculture, manufacturing, transportation and demand, including supply-chain optimization and sustainable agriculture partnerships; a global productivity and reinvestment program and zero-based budgeting designed to reconfigure processes, standardize information systems, optimize resource allocation and drive cost savings that are reinvested in brand-building and commercial agility; strategic refranchising of North America territories and the integration and restructuring of bottling and distribution operations to enhance local market focus, speed decision-making and align incentives; and cross-functional committees, scenario-based risk assessments and collaboration with bottling partners to manage hazards ranging from cyber-attacks and legal or regulatory changes to geopolitical unrest and natural disasters, all of which reflect a systemic perspective on resilience as the ability to adapt, reconstitute operating models and sustain organizational strength under challenging conditions.

We maintain a comprehensive risk management and compliance framework designed to ensure the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including a corporate compliance program that “actively identifies, prevents and mitigates risk” through policies, systems and a culture of compliance with health care fraud and abuse laws, off-label promotion prohibitions and global transparency requirements.  We rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers and clinical research organizations to source raw materials, conduct nonclinical and clinical trials and supply finished product, recognizing that “any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials” and that we “do not have control over their operations,” which requires us to monitor and manage contractual relationships, inventory levels and manufacturing process validation in order to preserve operational continuity.  Our information technology systems and network infrastructures are subject to “risk of breakdowns or breaches” from cyber-attacks, malware, employee misuse, power disruptions or disasters that “could materially adversely affect our business,” so we maintain security measures and contingency plans to protect data integrity and system resilience.  We have leased and constructed headquarters and laboratory facilities—“located in a flood zone along the Massachusetts coast”—for which we record and periodically re-measure exit and build-out obligations, apply subleasing strategies to offset ongoing costs and assess fair-value estimates of remaining lease commitments to maintain operational flexibility.  Our senior secured credit facility includes covenants requiring maintenance of minimum net revenue levels and restricting certain activities, which we monitor closely to preserve financial resilience and liquidity.  We invest heavily in research and development infrastructure, human capital and cross-functional decision-making processes, allocating resources among programs and partnerships in order to adapt to regulatory changes, competitive pressures and unexpected delays, and we rigorously assess potential acquisitions and collaborations through due diligence, integration planning and milestone-based funding to safeguard strategic agility and organizational health.  In the event of catastrophic events—natural disasters, regulatory actions, quality failures or safety issues—we maintain insurance programs, post-marketing surveillance, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, emergency management procedures and recall readiness to protect system integrity, preserve functioning and support our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance despite adversity.

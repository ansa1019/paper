The annual report warns that “other unforeseen events beyond our control, such as oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions, travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as ebola, influenza h1n1, avian bird flu and sars, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities or travel related accidents, can disrupt travel or otherwise result in declines in travel demand,” noting that because these events “are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services,” and that disruptions in third-party systems or GDSs could “prevent us from booking related accommodation, rental car and airline reservations.”  The company states that “we have experienced ‘denial-of-service’ type attacks on our systems that have made portions of our websites slow or unavailable for periods of time” and that “we expend significant resources in an attempt to prepare for and mitigate the effects of any such attacks,” while also maintaining that “we do maintain redundant systems and hosting services” but “do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.”  To secure its operations the report explains “we currently require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems” and “we also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts,” although it concedes that “our efforts to protect information from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful or may result in the rejection of legitimate attempts to book reservations through our services, any of which could result in lost business,” and that “these issues are likely to become more difficult to manage as we expand the number of places where we operate and as the tools and techniques used in such attacks become more advanced.”  Finally, the report acknowledges that it “does not have a completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business,” and that “any system failure that causes an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation, damage our brands or result in consumers choosing to use a competitive service, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”

KKR acknowledges that its operations heavily depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential information through its financial, accounting and data processing systems and that any failure, disabling event or security breach—whether from system outages, malicious code, infrastructure disruptions, natural disasters or other emergencies—could disrupt business continuity, expose it to liability, regulatory intervention or reputational harm and impair its ability to function under challenging conditions; accordingly, KKR maintains business continuation and disaster recovery programs, implements protective measures and endeavors to mitigate known risks to the extent practicable, yet it can provide no assurance that such mitigation efforts will be successful. The firm further recognizes that its capacity to allocate resources efficiently, scale costs to match downturns in net income and adjust to external pressures—from adverse market and economic conditions, regulatory capital requirements, funding constraints and evolving tax regimes—directly affects its operational flexibility, risk-mitigation capabilities and strategic adaptation, and that limitations in its liquidity, hedging effectiveness or disaster recovery infrastructure may impair its ability to preserve or improve performance, recover from disruptions, respond to unexpected situations and sustain competitive advantage under extreme or exceptional conditions.

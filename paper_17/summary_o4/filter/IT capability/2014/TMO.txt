Throughout the discussion, the company underscores its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning by expanding product lines and services through developing and commercializing its own technologies and strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, including the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies and related divestitures to secure antitrust approval, and by implementing productivity improvements—improved cost efficiencies from its practical process improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low‐cost region manufacturing. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts, writes down inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on expected demand, and reviews definite‐lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when indications of potential impairment exist, using projections of future cash flows discounted to present value and sensitivity analyses to monitor risk. It recognizes contingent liabilities for warranty obligations, environmental matters and legal proceedings, and assesses income tax positions and valuation allowances for tax assets and loss carryforwards based on expected profitability by jurisdiction. The company anticipates a significant adverse effect on revenues and operating income from the stronger U.S. dollar, forecasts that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.35 billion together with future cash flow from operations and available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility will meet cash requirements for at least the next 24 months, and intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds if commercial paper markets are not available. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience, current market and economic conditions, and expects its effective tax rate in 2015 to be less than 3% based on forecasted rates of profitability across approximately 50 countries, while also providing for contractual obligations and commercial commitments—debt principal, capital lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations, letters of credit, bank guarantees and acquisition-related contingent consideration—to ensure resilience through proactive measures that foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change and maintain the organization’s integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

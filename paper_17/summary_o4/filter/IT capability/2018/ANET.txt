The Company has experienced rapid growth and increased demand for its products over the last several years, which has placed a strain on its management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure and required it to manage an increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes across hardware and software development, contract manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, fulfillment and maintenance and support.  To manage domestic and international growth of its operations and personnel, the Company must continue to improve its operational, financial and management controls and its reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems.  Its success will depend in part upon its ability to manage its growth effectively by continuing to increase the productivity of its existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed.  The Company acknowledges that its systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud and that its failure to improve these systems, or their failure to operate effectively as intended, may result in disruption of its current operations and end-customer relationships, including the inability to manage growth and to accurately forecast revenue, expenses and earnings and to prevent losses.  The Company bases its inventory requirements on forecasts of future sales, which are subject to change, and recognizes that inaccuracies in these forecasts can lead to product shortages that impede customer production or excess supply that requires price reductions, write-downs and potentially redesign of products, all of which could materially adversely affect gross margins and operating results.  Because some key components are obtained from sole or limited sources and because it relies on third-party contract manufacturers and distribution channels, the Company is susceptible to supply shortages, delays, capacity constraints and quality control problems that could disrupt scheduled product deliveries, impair its ability to ship products, and damage customer relationships and revenue.  In the rapidly evolving cloud networking market, if the market does not develop as anticipated, if end customers do not adopt the Company’s solutions or if competing technologies emerge, the Company may be unable to compete effectively, its ability to generate revenue will suffer and its competitive position could be materially adversely affected.  To remain competitive and adapt to technological shifts, the Company must successfully manage product introductions and transitions, enhance existing products, develop new technologies and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, addressing market demand for disaggregated software and hardware solutions.  The Company’s ability to compete effectively also depends on its capacity to meet end-customer requirements for product qualification and testing, to manage production ramp-up issues, purchase commitments and inventory in line with anticipated demand, and to secure timely availability of merchant silicon and other critical components.  The Company further recognizes that external pressures—including market evolution, competitive pricing pressures, industry consolidation, economic conditions, geopolitical developments such as Brexit and tariffs, regulatory changes, cybersecurity breaches, and litigation over intellectual property—can result in significant fluctuations in its financial and operational results, impair its ability to maintain consistent revenue and margin performance and require significant legal expenditures, operational reconfiguration or product redesign.  Its business continuity and system integrity are subject to risks posed by natural disasters, geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions, any of which could delay shipments, disrupt critical functions and materially harm its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.  The preparation of its financial statements involves significant estimates, assumptions and judgments—particularly relating to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, contract manufacturer and supplier liabilities, income taxes and loss contingencies—and material weaknesses or changes in these critical accounting policies could adversely affect the accuracy and timing of its financial reporting, potentially leading to unfavorable market reactions and impairing its ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and organizational coherence under challenging conditions.

The company’s risk factors disclosure highlights the strategic emphasis on maintaining business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by managing exposures across its global operations, supply chains and financial systems. It underscores the importance of sustaining key manufacturing and supply arrangements, executing supply chain optimizations and sole‐supplier or plant arrangements to guard against labor disputes, site impairments, IT system discontinuities, raw‐material shortages, trade‐policy changes, natural disasters, extreme weather, war, terrorism and other uncontrollable external factors, and describes productivity improvements in manufacturing and overhead reinvested in product and packaging enhancements. A dedicated information and operational technology risk management program, supervised by IT management and reviewed by cross‐functional stakeholders, conducts regular analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats, implements employee training and updates security policies to prevent data breaches and system failures, and relies on robust business continuity plans to address operational outages, data loss or disclosure incidents. The company further outlines disciplined cash‐flow management and liquidity strategies, including the assessment of financing sources such as commercial paper programs, credit facilities and marketable securities, to ensure resource availability amid credit market disruptions, currency fluctuations and political or economic volatility. Ongoing portfolio and organizational change processes, encompassing acquisitions, divestitures, joint‐venture integration, leadership succession, workforce optimization, and compliance with evolving laws and regulations, support strategic agility and the preservation of performance under uncertainty. Additionally, hedging activities for interest rates, currency exchange and commodities, along with advance transfer‐pricing rulings and productivity and cost‐savings programs, reinforce the firm’s ability to absorb strain from internal or external disturbances and preserve or enhance functioning in dynamic, turbulent markets.

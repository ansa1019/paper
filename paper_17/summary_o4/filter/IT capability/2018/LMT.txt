Lockheed Martin’s annual report describes a variety of strategies and practices that underpin its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The company pursues long‐term, multi‐year contracts with both U.S. and international customers to stabilize revenues and preserve operational continuity even when government appropriations fluctuate, thereby absorbing internal and external variations without loss of core capabilities.  It allocates resources across independent research and development, capital expenditures and portfolio‐shaping acquisitions and divestitures to ensure emergent needs can be met and legacy programs sustained, reflecting a systemic perspective on resource deployment and innovation.  Risk mitigation mechanisms such as foreign‐currency forward contracts, interest‐rate swaps and commercial‐paper facilities enable adaptive financing and preserve system integrity in the face of market volatility.  The use of performance‐based payments, percentage-of-completion revenue recognition and progress‐payment terms provides flexibility in contract execution and shields the firm from excessive warranty and sustainment cost risk.  Divestiture of non-core businesses and the consolidation of ventures and joint ventures enhance organizational coherence, reduce fragmentation and reconfigure the company’s operating footprint to match evolving strategic objectives.  The annual assessment and incorporation of actuarial assumptions—discount rates, expected returns on plan assets and updated longevity projections—into pension funding and expense reflect ongoing adaptation to demographic and market perturbations, while large discretionary contributions create prepayment credits that buffer against future funding uncertainty.  Off-balance-sheet arrangements such as industrial cooperation (“offset”) agreements and standby letters of credit are managed to support customer requirements in foreign jurisdictions and preserve competitive advantage without compromising financial strength.  Operating profit and margin improvements are driven by continuous capability development and delivery strategies, risk retirements on underperforming contracts, cost recoveries on restructuring actions, and disciplined performance‐to-plan reviews—each a mechanism for partial maintenance of performance under pressure.  These practices, taken together, constitute resilience strategies that enable the company to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden changes in budgetary, technical or market conditions and to emerge stronger from disruptive events without losing strategic focus or operational effectiveness.

In our risk factors section, we caution that “if any of the risks and uncertainties described…actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations…could be materially and adversely affected,” reflecting the importance of risk mitigation and preservation of functioning under adverse conditions. We operate in an “increasingly competitive and rapidly changing environment” that demands strategic agility and operational flexibility. To anticipate and counter external disturbances such as cyber-attacks, we “continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss.” Our reliance on information technology across administrative functions, point-of-sale processing, supply chain management and digital initiatives is supported by “operational safeguards,” redundancy efforts and “incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans,” which, if ineffective, “could result in an interruption in our operations and…material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results.” We recognize that “any material interruption in our supply chain…could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability,” and thus we engage a diverse network of domestic and international suppliers, monitor performance and enforce compliance to detect and address quality and safety hazards. In our market risk disclosures, we describe a “market price risk management policy” and the use of hedging instruments for commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates to safeguard financial resources and preserve performance. Our MD&A further describes “streamlining efforts…to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and removing non-core, slow growth activities,” and the realignment of organizational and operating structures in support of newly established global alliances, illustrating our capacity to reconfigure resource deployment, adapt to strategic initiatives and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

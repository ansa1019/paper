Recognizing that “operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment,” the company emphasizes its ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments and to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas while transforming its business to deliver more software and subscription offerings, thereby bolstering business continuity and performance under environmental perturbations. It states that “inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence,” and that “when facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations,” illustrating its approach to risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration. The company acknowledges that it “plans our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels,” but that expenses are “relatively fixed in the short term,” prompting restructuring actions—“we initiated a restructuring plan … to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas”—to enhance operational flexibility and resource deployment. It manages distribution channel complexity through a two-tier system and strategic alliances, warning that “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins,” and supports nonlinearity in shipping patterns and fluctuating customer lead times with multiple financing programs. By leveraging its strong cash, cash equivalents and investment portfolio alongside committed credit facilities to fund working capital, customer financing, acquisitions and shareholder returns, and by continuously assessing allowances for receivables, warranties and contingencies, the company seeks to absorb strain, adapt to sudden market shifts and preserve integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional disturbances.

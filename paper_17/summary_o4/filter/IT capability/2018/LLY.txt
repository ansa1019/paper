We must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies, and we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules so that a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. In the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values that can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating, and we seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency forward and option contracts, the gains and losses on which offset, in part, the impact of exchange-rate fluctuations on our assets and liabilities; accordingly, based on our interest rate and foreign currency exposure at December 31, 2018 and 2017, hypothetical 10 percent shifts in interest or exchange rates would not have a material impact on our earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. We face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating rates of the U.S. dollar against the euro and Japanese yen and manage these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, while continuing to monitor deteriorating economies and recognizing that future charges may arise, although we do not expect such charges to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. Failure, inadequacy, or breach of our information technology systems, infrastructure, or data protection could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights, interrupt product manufacturing or services that rely on IT, damage operations, customer relationships, or reputation, or cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages, and although we have implemented measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent these risks, these measures may not be successful. Manufacturing difficulties at our facilities or contracted sites, whether due to quality or regulatory compliance problems, natural disasters, mechanical or IT system vulnerabilities, or inability to obtain sole-source raw materials, could lead to product shortages and lost revenue, and we rely on third-party suppliers, distributors, collaborations, and service providers for critical aspects of development, manufacture, commercialization, information technology support, and financial processes, recognizing that failure of these parties to perform to our standards or satisfy legal and contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe cash provided by operating activities, together with available cash and cash equivalents, should be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs—including installment payments of the toll tax, dividends to shareholders, share repurchases, and capital expenditures—and we continue to evaluate business development transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and enhance shareholder value.

Our disclosures emphasize the ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by describing how we strive to preserve organizational functioning and performance despite internal and external variations and disturbances. We address uncertainty about global economic conditions, including credit and sovereign debt concerns, which have caused and may continue to cause disruptions in the financial credit markets, leading customers and distributors to postpone or reduce spending and suppliers to face insolvency or credit constraints resulting in product delays. We detail our efforts to allocate and effectively manage resources, including scaling training for surgical teams, maintaining inventory and manufacturing capacity, and employing operating lease arrangements to provide flexibility in capital acquisition. We monitor and mitigate risks through foreign currency hedging, diversification of distributors, and protection of intellectual property. Our business continuity planning encompasses management of business interruptions due to natural disasters, epidemic diseases, prolonged government shutdowns, and cybersecurity threats, with programs to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents. We note the challenges of regulatory and reimbursement uncertainties, the risks of product defects and recalls and of termination of strategic relationships, and caution that our operating results in any particular period may not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Through investments in technology infrastructure, research and development, and strategic initiatives, we seek to support operational flexibility, systemic integrity, and resilience to environmental turbulence and varied pressures on our organizational health.

Organizational resilience-related disclosures in the report emphasize the company’s reliance on the continuous, secure operation of complex information systems and the availability of personnel, office facilities, telecommunications and computing infrastructure to preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, noting that disasters or other business continuity events—including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terrorist attacks, pandemics, security breaches, cyber-attacks, power losses or telecommunications failures—could cause operational challenges, material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory or legal liability and reputational harm if the firm is unable to detect long-latency compromises in a timely manner, deploy security patches or implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards and controls. The report also highlights the challenges of integrating acquired businesses, where delays or difficulties in completing the integration of information and technology, accounting, tax, financial reporting, human resources and other systems, together with failures to identify or remediate weaknesses and vulnerabilities in acquired entities’ information systems, could expose the firm to unexpected liabilities or make its own systems more vulnerable, requiring allocation of resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties. Third-party and vendor dependencies are identified as risks to operational continuity, as failures by those parties to comply with service level agreements or secure their processes could interrupt critical services and force the company to incur significant expense to remediate. The company describes its resilience strategies to mitigate these risks, including regularly assessing and improving business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession, making strategic investments in technology systems and infrastructure, simplifying organizational structures, retaining and distributing critical experience and expertise, and securing business disruption insurance while acknowledging that such insurance may not fully cover recovery costs. Additionally, the firm underscores that maintaining a cohesive culture, preserving operational flexibility through streamlined management layers, relying on its senior leadership team and sustaining a diverse, engaged workforce are essential to foreseeing, confronting and benefiting from sudden disruptive change, remaining competitive amid digital disruption and regulatory pressures, adapting operations to ensure continuity and performance maintenance, and mitigating the diversion of management attention to regulatory investigations or compliance efforts that could otherwise strain its preparedness.

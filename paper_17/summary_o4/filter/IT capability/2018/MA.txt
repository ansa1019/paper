Mastercard maintains a formal business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies to ensure operational continuity in the event of technology malfunctions, power outages, security breaches or other catastrophic disruptions. The company allocates substantial resources to defending its interchange rate-setting rights and to compliance and risk-management policies and procedures covering clearing and settlement activities, collateral requirements and participant default protocols, while continuously diversifying and innovating its core global payments processing network and real-time account-based payment capabilities to adapt to evolving authentication standards, data protection rules and customer needs. Despite these measures, the failure of third-party service providers, prolonged service outages, cybersecurity incidents or rapid shifts in technology standards could cause interruptions, malfunctions or breaches that compromise system integrity, trigger regulatory intervention, impair customer trust and materially affect business performance. Strategic agility is further challenged by the need to reconfigure products and services in response to varying jurisdictional requirements for data localization, network exclusivity and surcharging, all while preserving the security, reliability and scalability of its switching systems amid global regulatory, technological and market volatility.

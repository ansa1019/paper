While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe practicable and reasonable, we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. We face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted for in our funds, and our public markets business line is highly dependent on our ability to process and evaluate, on a daily basis, transactions across markets and geographies in a time-sensitive, efficient and accurate manner. Our and our third-party service providers’ information systems and technology may not be able to accommodate growth or be suitable for new products and strategies, and any failure to accommodate growth or increases in related costs could have a material adverse effect on our business. We maintain business continuation and disaster recovery programs that may not be sufficient to mitigate harm from a disaster or disruption, and we are dependent on an increasingly concentrated group of third-party vendors for hosting solutions and technologies, where a disaster or disruption could impair our ability to operate without interruption. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential information, and breaches or cyber-security incidents — including state-sponsored attacks — could result in significant losses, increased costs, liability, regulatory intervention, negative publicity and loss of confidence by our fund investors and clients. Global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, affecting investment values, our ability to exit investments profitably, to raise capital, to deploy new capital, and to grow our businesses, while periods of market volatility can present both substantial risks and opportunities to invest at reduced valuations. We intend to fund dividends and growth initiatives through cash flows from operations, carried interest distributions and the ongoing support of the kkr group partnerships, which exposes us to liquidity needs arising from commitments to seed new strategies, fund capital commitments, underwrite capital markets transactions, develop acquisition opportunities, service debt obligations, and support co-investments through both consolidated and unconsolidated entities.

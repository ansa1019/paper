AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it and acknowledges that additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently believed to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business, illustrating its ongoing process of risk assessment and adaptation. AbbVie carries business interruption insurance to mitigate the risk of supply disruptions from single-source suppliers, reflecting a mechanism for operational continuity under adverse conditions. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products and normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits, demonstrating its capacity to preserve market exclusivity and competitive advantage under legal pressures. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers and recognizes that an interruption could impair its ability to deliver products, for which it carries business interruption insurance to protect against failure, illustrating its approach to preserving functioning amid disruptions. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses, which could lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations and time and expense spent investigating the cause, reflecting its contingency planning and investigative processes under unexpected manufacturing failures. AbbVie’s research and development efforts require ongoing substantial expenditures without assurance of commercial success, indicating its resource allocation in the face of high failure rates inherent in pharmaceutical research and development. AbbVie’s innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement, highlighting its engagement in market adaptation and stakeholder management. AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and acknowledges that if a significant distributor encounters financial or other difficulties, it may be unable to collect all amounts owed, demonstrating its scenario planning for distribution risks. AbbVie has debt obligations requiring a portion of its cash flow from operations to make interest payments and reducing cash available to fund other purposes, and if it raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants, illustrating its management of financial constraints and strategic resource allocation. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business, which are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion or breakdown, and although it has invested in data protection and monitors its systems, it acknowledges that breaches could result in loss of revenue or critical information and substantial remediation costs, indicating its continued investment in resilience mechanisms within its IT infrastructure. AbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding to manage credit risk, establishes allowances against accounts receivable and may utilize factoring arrangements, reflecting its risk monitoring and mitigation practices. AbbVie’s long-term success depends on its ability to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds in development by other companies, demonstrating its emphasis on innovation, collaboration and resource reconfiguration to sustain performance under uncertainty. AbbVie intends to fund short-term and long-term obligations through cash on hand, future cash flows or by issuing additional debt, and believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to support its growth objectives, illustrating its strategic foresight and financial resilience. AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term, highlighting its systemic perspective and organizational foresight to maintain performance under challenging conditions. In 2018, AbbVie’s research and development expenses included a $5.1 billion intangible asset impairment charge related to in-process research and development acquired as part of the 2016 Stemcentrx acquisition following the decision to stop enrollment in the TAHOE trial, with the impairment primarily due to lower probabilities of success across early-stage assets, demonstrating its capacity to reconfigure resource allocation and absorb financial strain when projects fail to meet their development milestones.

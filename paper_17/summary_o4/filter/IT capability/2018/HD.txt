Our business and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition, evolving customer preferences, unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters, and regulatory changes, and our ability to maintain continuity under these pressures—including timely and appropriate responses to competitive dynamics, rapid adaptation of inventory levels, localization of assortments, and safeguarding a safe store environment—is essential to preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We must continually anticipate and adapt to changes in the purchasing process, such as faster, guaranteed delivery times and low-price or free shipping, and our substantial investments in store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives under the One Home Depot experience are intended to streamline operations, simplify customer interactions and create an efficient delivery network, yet transformation of these systems could disrupt operations if not executed with proper resource allocation and pace. Business continuity also relies on our capacity to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates, including specialized technology professionals, while controlling labor costs amid external wage and healthcare regulations and minimizing turnover. Our extensive reliance on information technology systems and third-party service providers for transaction processing, inventory replenishment and digital platforms renders us vulnerable to system failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, power outages or catastrophic events, any of which could significantly disrupt operations and impair our interconnected retail strategy. Disruptions in our logistics or supply chain network—arising from weather-related events, natural disasters, trade policy changes, supplier insolvencies, third-party disputes or transportation constraints—could hinder our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair customer demand and damage our reputation. We actively manage payment-related risks, commodity price volatility, seasonality, self-insured liabilities and legal or regulatory exposures through ongoing risk assessment, resource generation, and capital deployment, and we leverage our liquidity, access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets, and non-GAAP measures such as return on invested capital to monitor performance, fund capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and debt obligations, and support rapid response, recovery and long-term organizational stability.

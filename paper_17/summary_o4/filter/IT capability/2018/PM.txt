The company emphasizes that its forward-looking statements are based on prudent plans and assumptions and that it faces a broad range of external pressures—including economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters, pandemics, conflicts and civil unrest—that could materially disrupt its operations and supply chain. In recognition of these risks, it maintains backup systems and business-continuity plans to protect its information systems from failure or security breaches, while noting that any such disruption could result in significant remediation costs, reputational damage and revenue losses. The report further acknowledges the need to reconfigure resources—such as replacing third-party contract manufacturers with internal capabilities—to adapt production capacity to shifting adult consumer preferences and to develop new products, broaden brand portfolios, improve productivity and ensure sufficient capacity under uncertain conditions. It highlights the variable adoption and financial performance of its reduced-risk products in differing competitive, regulatory and fiscal environments and underscores the importance of transforming its culture and talent base to achieve strategic goals and maintain competitive advantage. Additionally, the company identifies supply-chain vulnerabilities related to climate change, crop quality and government controls that may necessitate adjustments in resource deployment and cost structures, as well as revenue risks from currency fluctuations, pricing and tax regime changes. Litigation, regulatory investigations and intense competition are cited as persistent threats, reinforcing the need for ongoing risk assessment, strategic foresight, innovation efforts and flexible resource allocation to preserve organizational health and sustain performance under challenging and evolving conditions.

Nike’s 10-K discloses a comprehensive set of practices and resources designed to enhance its capacity to absorb strain and preserve performance under adversity, including extensive business continuity planning supported by business interruption insurance, a committed $2 billion credit facility and a commercial paper program to safeguard liquidity amid volatile economic and market conditions. Foreign exchange volatility is centrally managed through natural offsets, currency-correlation analysis and forward and option contracts that hedge transactional exposures and delay the impact of rate movements on earnings, while standard rate assignments and factory-currency exposure indices stabilize inventory costs. To address unpredictable demand, seasonality and shifting consumer preferences, Nike deploys operational flexibility by placing product orders four to six months in advance, managing inventory reserves, leveraging multiple transportation modes—including expedited air freight—and enforcing supplier and licensee compliance with environmental, health and safety standards to enable rapid reconfiguration of its supply chain. A significant reliance on complex information technology systems for supply planning, digital commerce and retail operations is underpinned by ongoing investments in global IT infrastructure and distribution centers, together with business continuity plans to mitigate disruptions from system failures, security breaches, natural disasters or pandemics. Evolving legal, regulatory and compliance risks—such as U.S. tax reform under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, GDPR requirements, changing trade policies and geopolitical events—are addressed through continuous risk assessment, hedging, contingent liability reserves and adaptive accounting policies to maintain system integrity and financial resilience. Marketing and endorsement commitments are managed via disciplined demand-creation budgeting and performance monitoring to uphold brand strength, while human capital strategies focus on recruiting, retaining and developing talent to sustain organizational health and dynamic capabilities. Through these systemic perspectives, adaptive strategies and resource-allocation mechanisms, Nike aims to maintain positive adjustment, operational integrity and performance continuity in the face of internal and external pressures.

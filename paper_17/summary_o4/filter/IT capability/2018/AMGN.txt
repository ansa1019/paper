The Annual Report on Form 10-K describes how the Company’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions depends on a resilient manufacturing and supply network that can absorb strain and preserve performance despite internal or external variations and disturbances.  The report highlights the reliance on diesel-powered back-up generators and a rapid reconfiguration of operations when Hurricane Maria disrupted the Puerto Rico electric grid, notes that manufacturing biologic therapeutics is complex, highly regulated and vulnerable to equipment failures, contamination, power outages or interruptions at third-party contract manufacturers, and recognizes that any such disruptions could result in delayed shipments, clinical trial delays, supply constraints, stock-outs and adverse impacts on firm performance.  It details the use of syndicated credit facilities, commercial paper programs, interest rate and cross-currency swaps to manage financial risk, and the execution of a company-wide transformation and process improvement plan that has generated savings reallocated to product launches and R&D pipelines, illustrating strategic resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation.  The report further acknowledges dynamic external pressures—including evolving federal and state reimbursement policies, intensified pricing scrutiny by payers, cybersecurity threats to critical information systems, global economic volatility and regulatory changes—which require ongoing risk assessment, strategic agility, organizational change processes and inter-organizational collaboration.  Finally, it describes initiatives to diversify supplier bases, open clinical trial sites in new geographies, maintain hedging programs against currency fluctuations and invest in next-generation biomanufacturing facilities with smaller footprints and lower resource consumption, all of which reflect a systemic perspective on ensuring business continuity, adaptability and the partial maintenance of integrity and performance under extreme or exceptional conditions.

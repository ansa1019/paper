Disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members; we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots, and failure or disruption of our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our businesses. Given the very high volume of transactions we process each year, it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems, which are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees; any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are currently making, and will continue to make, investments to improve or advance critical information systems and processing capabilities; failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would be harmful, and the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share; failure to identify timely or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. We believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items, and through our online offerings. Our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and depots; local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating warehouses and depots. Failure to effectively manage these and other similar factors may affect our ability to timely build or lease and operate new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability. We opened 21 net new warehouses and relocated 4 warehouses in 2018 and plan to open approximately 20 net new warehouses and relocate up to 4 warehouses in 2019; our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses, and capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations and working capital. Management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We receive, retain, and transmit personal information about our members and employees and entrust that information to third-party business associates, including cloud service-providers that perform activities for us; a compromise of our security systems or defects within our hardware or software, or those of our business associates, that results in our members’ or employees’ information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation, government actions, or the imposition of penalties. We have security measures and controls to protect personal and business information and continue to make investments to secure access to our information technology network; these measures may be undermined, however, due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, internal or external malfeasance, or otherwise, and an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. We are predominantly self-insured for employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, directors’ and officers’ liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss; liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are estimated using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions, and while we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes, particularly in locations where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance by causing physical damage to properties, temporary closures, workforce shortages, disruptions in supply or transport of goods, delays in delivery to warehouses or depots and reduction in product availability; factors associated with climate change, including government regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and extreme weather conditions and rising sea levels, could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. Our business is highly competitive across a range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, and our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results. General economic factors, domestically and internationally, including inflation, levels of unemployment, consumer debt levels, foreign-currency exchange rates, and unsettled financial markets could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require changes in product mix, or impact the cost of or ability to purchase inventory; while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items, and through our online offerings.

The company’s disclosures describe a broad set of measures intended to sustain operations and performance under internal and external pressures—from rapid and significant technological change, customer‐driven product obsolescence risks and evolving industry standards to economic downturns, currency fluctuations, trade disruptions, regulatory shifts, quality failures, supply chain interruptions, natural disasters, cyberattacks and geopolitical events—and to absorb strain without sacrificing core functionality. Key resilience strategies include directed resource allocation for new product development and focused R&D funding, strategic acquisitions and integration of complementary businesses, global sourcing initiatives, consolidation of facilities and headcount reductions to achieve productivity improvements, expansion of commercial infrastructure (including geographic market penetration and e-commerce platforms), maintenance of diversified manufacturing and warehousing footprints, contingency planning for transportation and logistics failures, rigorous quality management and compliance systems, reinforced IT and data security controls, and dynamic liquidity management via cash reserves, commercial paper markets and revolving credit facilities. Together, these organizational capabilities—encompassing proactive risk assessment and allocation of financial, operational and human capital—are designed to preserve system integrity, maintain performance under pressure, facilitate rapid adaptation and reconfiguration, and support the company’s ability to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

Goldman Sachs discloses a comprehensive business‐continuity and risk‐mitigation framework designed to ensure maintenance of operations and financial integrity under a broad range of adverse conditions, including severe market dislocations, operational failures, cyber events, natural disasters, geopolitical disruptions or other crises.  The firm has established resilience plans and facilities—ranging from “global core liquid assets” to contingency funding and intraday liquidity models, stress tests and recovery and resolution planning—to pre‐fund potential cash and collateral outflows under multiple combined market‐wide and firm‐specific stress scenarios, to maintain requisite capital and liquidity, and to support orderly business wind‐down, as necessary.  A robust governance structure guides this approach, with board‐approved risk appetites, firmwide risk committees and an independent second line of defense in liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk management, all of which require periodic monitoring, scenario analysis, regular limit reviews and independent model validation.  The firm continuously updates its operational systems and infrastructure to support growth, new regulations and evolving threats, employs diversified funding across unsecured and secured tenors, allocates capital through an internal attribution framework, and maintains stress‐tested long‐term funding profiles, in each case to absorb shocks, preserve functioning and enable positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The annual report describes a comprehensive risk management and business‐continuity framework designed to enable the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances, and reconfigure organizational trajectories toward future resilience. The company emphasizes its ability to anticipate and respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences—such as health and wellness demands, e-commerce growth and sustainability expectations—and to reallocate resources toward product innovation, reformulations and sustainable packaging to sustain functioning and firm performance under pressure. Disclosures address operational flexibility and preparedness for disruptive events—including natural disasters, pandemics, political unrest, cyberattacks and supply chain interruptions—through contingency planning, disaster‐recovery capabilities and diversified sourcing, while noting that no security measures can provide absolute protection. The report highlights investments in productivity initiatives, shared services and refranchising strategies to reconfigure manufacturing, distribution and go-to-market systems, thereby absorbing strain, mitigating risk and preserving organizational coherence. Climate change and water scarcity are discussed as environmental perturbations prompting capital expenditures, technology deployment for water efficiency, and water‐use governance to maintain system integrity. The company’s integrated risk management framework, with rigorous board‐level oversight, cross‐functional risk committees and monitoring of key macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive pressures, is presented as a systemic mechanism for assessing impact, deploying strategic responses and ensuring business continuity, ultimately positioning the organization to emerge stronger from adversity and sustain growth and competitive advantage.

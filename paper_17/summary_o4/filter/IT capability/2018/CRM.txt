While we have security measures in place to protect our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ data, our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of third-party attempts to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information, efforts by hackers or state-sponsored organizations, vulnerabilities in enhancements and updates, dependencies on products and components across a broad ecosystem, attacks on underlying networks and services not under our control, and employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems; such incidents could result in unauthorized parties obtaining or being denied access to IT systems or data, damage our reputation, expose us to legal liabilities and negative financial impacts, and lead to additional direct and indirect costs such as increased infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities.  These risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks, with our board of directors, audit committee and executive management regularly briefed on our cyber-security policies, practices and ongoing efforts to improve security.  We use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, including near real-time replication of our production environment and customer data in separate facilities and alternate arrangements for certain offerings, although we do not control these facilities and they remain vulnerable to earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, sabotage, administrative actions and other unanticipated events that could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any interruptions or delays in services from third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or other hardware and software vendors, or our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions and infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair service delivery, cause performance degradation or outages, subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer attrition, and harm our business.  If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business.  Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary and third-party software, they may contain errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime and harm our reputation and business, and may create vulnerabilities that inadvertently permit unauthorized access to customer data; in addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that cause disruptions for other customers.  As we acquire companies, we may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our services and in augmenting those technologies to meet our quality standards, which could disrupt operations and customer continuity.  Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, upgrade or replace our software systems effectively, or manage migrations away from legacy applications in a timely manner, we may be unable to execute our business plan or maintain service performance under pressure.  We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements and borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next twelve months and provide financial flexibility, but our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning depends on maintaining sufficient liquidity and adapting our resource allocation to evolving market, regulatory and technological conditions.  Our corporate headquarters and a significant portion of our research and development activities, IT systems and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area, and our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics and other catastrophic events; although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, a major earthquake or climate-related event, including extreme weather impacts on critical infrastructure, could materially and adversely affect our operations, cause higher attrition and losses, and require additional costs and recovery time to resume operations.  We regularly review global compensation to ensure equal pay for equal work, invest in employee-led governance and training programs to foster organizational health, and anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to expand data center capacity, hire and retain personnel, further enhance our services, develop new technologies, integrate acquisitions and extend our global infrastructure in order to maintain operational flexibility, resilience and performance maintenance under challenging and rapidly changing conditions.

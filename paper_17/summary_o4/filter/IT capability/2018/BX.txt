Management acknowledges that its operations depend on the integrity and availability of its financial, accounting, communications and other data-processing systems, and that failures, breaches or disabling of those systems—including those caused by cybersecurity threats, social engineering or third-party service disruptions—could impair business continuity, damage reputation and limit its growth. The firm further recognizes that a disaster or infrastructure failure at its New York City headquarters or elsewhere may overwhelm its disaster recovery and continuity programs, potentially impeding its ability to conduct operations without interruption. It is also acutely aware of its dependence on external credit markets and leverage, noting that tightening credit conditions, rising interest rates, lack of available financing or regulatory limitations on debt could hinder its ability to complete and refinance transactions, force expense reductions or personnel changes, and require rapid resource reallocation to preserve functionality under stress. Market volatility and downturns can provoke significant mark-to-market repricing, reducing liquidity and forcing strategic responses—such as asset sales, cost containment or capital reconfiguration—to maintain performance under pressure. Geopolitical events, legal and regulatory changes, environmental hazards or terrorist attacks are similarly identified as stressors that may constrain resources, impose compliance burdens or necessitate organizational realignment. Collectively, these disclosures reflect an emphasis on adaptation, risk assessment, operational flexibility and recovery mechanisms designed to sustain the firm’s integrity and performance in the face of internal and external perturbations.

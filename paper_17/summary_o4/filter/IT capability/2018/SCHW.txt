Charles Schwab’s annual report describes a comprehensive risk management framework that spans operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks and is overseen by a global risk committee with formal sub-committees, regular risk identification, measurement, monitoring, and mitigation processes, and board-approved risk appetite statements and key risk metrics. To minimize business interruptions and preserve performance under adverse conditions, Schwab maintains a geographically dispersed workforce, backup and recovery infrastructure with dedicated communication facilities, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans within a well-established incident management program. The firm devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity, and scalability of its critical business functions and technology systems, including a tightly integrated information security program with advanced monitoring systems, internal authentication controls, collaboration with government agencies and industry peers, and ongoing testing of discount window and funding procedures. Schwab conducts regular liquidity and capital stress testing, maintains diversified funding sources, adheres to internal liquidity and capital contingency plans for low-probability, high-impact scenarios, and allocates capital and liquidity to support subsidiaries while remaining well capitalized even in stressed environments. Interest-rate sensitivity is managed by matching the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to limit exposure to falling rates while benefiting from rising rates. Through disciplined capital planning, resource allocation for technology and campus expansions, and robust governance— including chief risk officer reporting to the board risk committee—Schwab continually strengthens its ability to absorb strain, adapt to disruptions, and sustain integrity and performance in nominal, extreme, or exceptional conditions.

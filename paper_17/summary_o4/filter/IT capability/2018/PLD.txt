Prologis discloses that its operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect business continuity and firm performance, including volatility in global capital and credit markets, system failures, cyber security attacks and natural disasters, and maintains system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan for its internal and hosted information technology systems even as it recognizes vulnerability to energy blackouts, war, telecommunication failures and unauthorized access. The company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the U.S. and allocates resources to staffing, compliance controls and procedures across regions to mitigate currency fluctuations and restrictions, transfer pricing and tax regulations, multiple and potentially conflicting laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars, political instability, uncertainty over property rights and civil unrest. It seeks to preserve or improve functioning by borrowing in local currencies, establishing natural hedges through currency‐matched debt and designating derivative instruments as net investment hedges to offset translation adjustments, while recognizing that hedging arrangements involve fluctuation risks and counterparty exposure. Prologis depends on the deep industry knowledge and retention of key personnel to sustain organizational health and operational flexibility and continually reviews its disclosure controls, procedures and internal control over financial reporting to prevent errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. To maintain financial resilience, the company manages liquidity from operating cash flow, strategic capital revenues, distributions from co‐investment ventures and proceeds from property contributions and dispositions, while accessing and monitoring credit facilities and capital markets subject to credit ratings and covenant compliance, and may reconfigure capital deployment by divesting properties, adjusting leverage or seeking alternative capital sources to address resource constraints or emergency funding needs. It also monitors environmental, seismic, hurricane and flood risks through insurance coverage, annual assessments and self-insurance decisions when commercially reasonable, and acknowledges potential physical and regulatory impacts from future climate change on its logistics facilities. Critical accounting policies related to acquisition fair value measurements, recoverability assessments of long-lived assets and impairment analyses support Prologis’s ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under adverse conditions.

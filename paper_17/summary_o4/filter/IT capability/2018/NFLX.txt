Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties we utilize, including cyber-attacks and internet interruptions caused by earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, power loss, telecommunications failures or other natural disasters, could result in loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data or theft of intellectual property and adversely impact our business, reflecting our dependence on reliable performance and the continuous development of systems and processes to thwart evolving cybersecurity threats. Our use of third-party “cloud” computing services and our proprietary global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) underscores the importance of maintaining technological infrastructure and interconnectivity with internet service providers, while the need to update partner devices and broaden platform relationships is critical to sustaining operational continuity. Scaling our streaming service internationally further introduces operational and regulatory complexity—from adapting content offerings to varied consumer customs and local laws to managing exposure to anti-corruption, taxation, currency and censorship risks—any of which, if not effectively managed, could harm our ability to attract, retain and serve members. Our long-term, fixed-cost content commitments, notably upfront production and licensing payments for original programming, require strategic resource allocation, liquidity planning and reliance on cash flows, available funds and access to financing sources to meet obligations and support growth despite anticipated negative free cash flows from content investments. We continuously monitor and refine our systems, operational practices and risk management frameworks to address technological, market and regulatory disruptions, employ rigorous accounting judgments in amortizing streaming content and evaluating deferred tax assets, and maintain insurance and indemnification arrangements where available to preserve service integrity and performance under challenging conditions, thereby enhancing our capacity to adapt, mitigate risks and sustain competitive advantage in the face of environmental perturbations and organizational stressors.

The company discloses that its rapid growth and expanded deployments “places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources,” and that “to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.” It warns that “failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, disrupt our existing end-customer relationships, reduce demand for or limit us to smaller deployments of our platform, or harm our business performance and operating results,” and acknowledges that “our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable,” reflecting external pressures such as global macroeconomic instability, uncertainties relating to Brexit, and foreign currency fluctuations. The company recognizes that “we may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner” and that its “existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud.” It identifies risks to continuity stemming from reliance on sole-source suppliers and manufacturing partners, noting that “a natural disaster, epidemic, capacity shortages, or quality problems” could disrupt its supply chain, and from data security threats, stating it is “virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate” attacks that could cause “system disruptions or slowdowns,” trigger “increased costs to remedy any problems,” and necessitate additional cybersecurity measures. The company further emphasizes the importance of “attracting and retaining qualified personnel” and preserving “critical aspects of our corporate culture” that “facilitate critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing,” as well as the need to “accurately predict end-customers’ changing needs” in areas such as mobility, virtualization, cloud computing, and software defined networks to avoid harm to its competitive position. It notes that “seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced” as it grows, and cautions that failure to comply with evolving environmental, data protection, export controls, and accounting regulations could lead to sanctions or operational disruptions. To support resilience, the company describes its use of cybersecurity insurance, foreign currency hedging through forward contracts, maintenance of significant cash, cash equivalents, and investments to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, and ongoing investments in “governance, internal control over financial reporting,” and “disclosure controls and procedures” aimed at preserving organizational health and enabling “positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

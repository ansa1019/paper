Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support adherence to a wide array of evolving global regulations and mitigate regulatory pressures, although we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all authorities. We are subject to central bank oversight in certain markets, which may require us to maintain additional local capital and financial resources and implement localized risk management or governance practices to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks. Our treasury policies guide management in evaluating cash requirements for operations, settlements, litigation payments and capital investments, and we hold approximately $7.6 billion of available liquidity globally, supplemented by a $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program, to ensure timely completion of payment settlement activities even if one or more clients are unable to settle. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies, including collateral requirements, to limit indemnification exposure to unsettled transactions, and we regularly assess our liquidity position in light of cash flow performance, capital market conditions and contingent obligations. In pursuit of operational flexibility and resilience, we invest in technology, infrastructure and payments system assets to support digital commerce and growth initiatives, and we work closely with third parties—financial institutions, merchants, processors and vendors—to process transactions properly, deliver client services and uphold our operating rules; failures by these parties could disrupt our operations and harm our reputation. We devote significant resources to cybersecurity and supplier risk management programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, but numerous and evolving cyber-attack threats, system failures or destructive software could significantly disrupt our operations and our clients’ experience, and in the event of such damage or disruption we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all critical business functions, assets and data through our business continuity program. To adapt to technological, competitive and regulatory developments, we continually adjust pricing and client incentives, customize service offerings, and enter into long-term incentive agreements, capitalizing advance payments when future economic benefits can be established and amortizing them over the period of expected benefit, with accruals based on periodic forecasts of client performance. Our strategic resilience also encompasses acquisitions and investments intended to accelerate innovation and digital commerce, while recognizing the risks of integration complexity, resource diversion and potential failure to realize anticipated synergies or efficiencies. We rely on our employees’ skills and experience and on our ability to attract, develop and retain key talent globally, acknowledging that changes in labor and immigration policies could constrain our capacity to respond to market demands. In managing legal and regulatory proceedings, we evaluate the probability and amount of potential losses and record provisions when losses are probable and estimable, consulting with counsel and updating estimates as new information emerges. Our tax provision reflects judgments about the timing and allocation of tax benefits, the impact of legislative changes such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and determinations of uncertain tax positions, all of which we reassess as returns are filed and audits conclude, thereby ensuring our resource deployment and financial reporting remain aligned with our objectives to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The Company discloses that it must manage fluctuating demand for its services and network capacity by resizing operations—including higher unit operating costs, workforce adjustments and storage of locomotives, rail cars and other equipment—and by improving its transportation plan, adding capacity, enhancing yard and facility operations and bolstering its ability to address surges in demand with adequate resources, although these measures may not fully prevent service shortcomings when demand exceeds planned capacity or when weather-related events compound network difficulties. It reports the implementation of Unified Plan 2020, a phased set of initiatives focused on increasing reliability of its service product, reducing variability in network operations, improving resource utilization costs and rationalizing terminals to optimize train operations and crew resources; as a result, the Company reduced its active locomotive fleet by 625 units and lowered operating car inventory by over 10% while handling similar volumes, driving improved average terminal dwell times and operational efficiency. The Company emphasizes a multi-faceted safety program—leveraging technology, risk assessments, training, employee engagement, quality control and targeted capital investments—and continues deploying Total Safety Culture and Courage to Care to identify and implement best practices for employee and public safety. Its 2019 capital plan, which may be revised if market conditions or regulatory changes affect returns, allocates approximately 75-80% of $3.2 billion in planned investments to renew and improve existing infrastructure while directing the balance toward new capacity projects, locomotive modernization and freight car acquisitions designed to support future business growth and operating efficiency. To maintain operational continuity and liquidity under internal or external perturbations, the Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, a $650 million receivables securitization facility, a $2 billion revolving credit facility and access to commercial paper and the capital markets. The Company also acknowledges and actively adapts to risks arising from severe weather and other natural phenomena, regulatory requirements such as positive train control implementation, fuel‐price volatility, labor disputes, environmental remediation obligations and the potential disruption of key suppliers, reflecting its ongoing efforts to preserve system integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

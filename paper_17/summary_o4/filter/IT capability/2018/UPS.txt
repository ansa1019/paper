UPS discloses a range of risk management and operational continuity measures that collectively underpin its organizational resilience, defined as the ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. The Company adjusts its business model to mitigate cyclical economic and local market pressures and maintains flexibility to respond to competitive and regulatory challenges, including timely rate increases, expanded fuel surcharges and derivative hedges to absorb fuel price volatility, and monitoring of foreign exchange and interest rate exposures. To preserve service continuity under volume surges and disruptions, UPS continually reconfigures its integrated air and ground network through technology-enabled sorting projects, additional aircraft leases, expanded Saturday operations, facility automation and capacity expansion, while systematically deploying information technology risk management, cyber-security protocols and disaster recovery plans to protect against system failures, data breaches, natural disasters and other unexpected events. The Company makes significant capital investments in aircraft, vehicles, facilities and technology, regularly reviews asset useful lives and impairment indicators to ensure system integrity, and diversifies geographically to reduce regional dependencies. UPS bolsters financial resilience through robust cash flow generation, global liquidity management, commercial paper and long-term debt programs, ongoing optimization of its capital structure via debt refinancing and share repurchases, and prudent pension and benefit plan funding under collective bargaining and multiemployer plan uncertainties, thereby sustaining its capacity to maintain operations, reconstitute resources and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

The Form 10-K discloses that the Company devotes significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures yet acknowledges that cyber-security threats develop, evolve and may outpace its defenses, which could result in unauthorized access to customer data, service interruptions, litigation, regulatory investigations, government fines, reputational damage, loss of sales and customers and other significant costs and liabilities; it further notes that a breach by the Company or its third-party service providers, or a denial-of-service attack, could invoke indemnification or service availability obligations, and that existing insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover such losses.  The risk factors also describe the Company’s reliance on crisis management and disaster response plans to address operational disruptions from natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, geopolitical instability, power outages, floods, fires and other catastrophic events—particularly given that much of its critical infrastructure and personnel are concentrated near major seismic faults—which could lead to data loss, extended recovery times and materially adverse effects on operations and financial condition.  The Company further acknowledges that maintaining competitive position and business continuity under rapidly changing technological, market and customer conditions requires accurate prediction, timely preparation and effective responses, including identifying and investing in emerging technologies, integrating with customers’ digital environments, innovating service delivery, and adapting resource allocation and operational processes; failure to do so, as well as sudden shifts in global macroeconomic and geopolitical environments—such as trade disputes, Brexit and currency fluctuations—could harm customer spending, contract renewals, operating costs and overall business performance.

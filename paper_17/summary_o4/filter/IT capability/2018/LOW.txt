Lowe’s has developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect its business, supported by a framework administered by the chief financial officer that includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for identified material risks; the company acknowledges that it may be unable to adapt its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address changing customer shopping habits, demands and demographics or to realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives, and that failure to implement change, growth and productivity initiatives successfully could negatively affect customer relationships, market share and results of operations.  The company’s strategic initiatives focused on omni-channel sales and marketing require delivery of large, complex programs with integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing, new competencies across many positions and adaptation of management, employees and contractors to new skills and capabilities, while poor performance of customer-facing technology systems or a lack of a disaster recovery plan could interrupt operations, impair the customer experience and damage reputation.  Cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer, employee, vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations present ongoing threats to operational continuity and business confidence, and the company remains subject to risk that unauthorized parties or system errors could compromise critical systems, leading to data loss, business interruptions, regulatory liability and reputational harm.  Lowe’s strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, involve uncertainties and risks related to integration of personnel, financial, IT and other systems, potential disruption of ongoing business, distraction of management and increased operational complexity, and may require substantial financial and managerial resources to achieve expected benefits.  The company’s supply chain transformation and fulfillment network enhancements are intended to enhance customer experience by advancing fulfillment and delivery capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to vendor failures, trade policy changes, geopolitical and natural events, labor disputes, capacity constraints and disruptive change that could delay inventory, raise costs or cause out-of-stocks.  Third-party installers and service providers introduce operational and legal risks that require effective management of permitting, licensing, quality and internal processes to avoid lost sales, fines, litigation and reputational damage.  Operating internationally presents unique challenges—from political, economic and regulatory differences to currency volatility and supplier management—that could impair profitability and financial position, while compliance with a broad array of laws and regulations exposes the company to enforcement actions, litigation, fines and operational burdens.  Lowe’s liquidity and access to capital depend on cash flows from operations, commercial paper, bank credit facilities and its credit ratings, which may be affected by financial market disruptions, debt rating downgrades or benchmark rate reforms, and continued adherence to covenants in credit agreements.  During fiscal 2018, the company undertook a comprehensive strategic reassessment, established a new leadership team, sharpened its focus on retail fundamentals, realigned decision-making and execution, rationalized store inventory to eliminate clutter and underperforming SKUs, exited non-core activities and underperforming locations, recorded asset impairment and lease-obligation charges, and announced plans to exit certain international operations.  Looking forward to 2019, Lowe’s will concentrate on four key focus areas—driving merchandising excellence through improved productivity, localization and execution; transforming its supply chain to enhance fulfillment and delivery; delivering operational efficiency by simplifying store operations and improving in-stock execution; and intensifying customer engagement, particularly with pro customers—while monitoring progress from merchandising pilots, supply chain investments and brand initiatives to ensure long-term performance maintenance and organizational resilience under challenging conditions.

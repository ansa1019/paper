In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NEE and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their business and any inability or failure to do so adequately could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. FPL’s use of derivative instruments in its risk management fuel procurement program is subject to an annual prudence review and, as allowed under the rate agreements, changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities until settlement. NEE and FPL maintain bank revolving line of credit facilities and letters of credit to provide liquidity, support the funding of loans and project financing activities, and to facilitate the issuance of commercial paper and standby letters of credit, and NEE has also issued guarantees related to equity contribution agreements for project development and construction. NEE and FPL have hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools, such as daily value at risk, earnings at risk, stop loss limits and liquidity guidelines, as well as credit enhancements, master netting agreements and collateral requirements, to manage their commodity, interest rate and counterparty credit exposures. The operation and maintenance of NEE’s and FPL’s electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities and gas infrastructure facilities are subject to many operational risks, including facility start-up operations, failures in fuel availability or transportation, performance below expected levels, breakdowns, extraordinary weather events and other major events, the consequences of which could include lost revenues due to prolonged outages, liability for liquidated damages, replacement equipment costs and additional storm restoration costs. Weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods and tornadoes, can be destructive and cause power outages and property damage, require NEE and FPL to incur additional costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power and to access available financing sources. Terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other disruptive activities could materially adversely affect NEE’s and FPL’s generation, transmission, distribution and information technology systems, limit their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and natural gas, and delay the development and construction of new facilities. NEE’s and FPL’s insurance coverage does not provide protection against all significant losses and, if insurance coverage is not available or obtainable on acceptable terms, NEE or FPL may be required to pay costs associated with adverse future events. NEE provides full energy and capacity requirements services and failure to manage supply costs or to hedge effectively against volatility in market prices for fuel, electricity and energy commodities could materially adversely affect its business, and reductions in the liquidity of energy markets may restrict its ability to manage operational risks. NEE invests in a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and maintains decommissioning funds for its and its subsidiaries’ nuclear units, with funding requirements sensitive to changes in market performance, interest rates and regulatory requirements. NEE uses derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, estimates their fair value using discounted cash flow and market-based valuation techniques, and records changes in fair value in its statements of income or regulatory assets or liabilities. NEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, by comparing carrying value to the undiscounted future net cash flows and recognizing any shortfall as an impairment loss. NEE records liabilities for asset retirement obligations, including decommissioning of nuclear, fossil and solar plants, based on regulatory-approved studies and probability-based scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning and funds such obligations through internal reserves.

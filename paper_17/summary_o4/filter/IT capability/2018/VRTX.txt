The Company’s organizational resilience may be challenged by its reliance on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers, where “supply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely,” with any such disruptions risking a “disruption in the commercial supply of our then-marketed medicines” or “delay the completion of clinical trials and affect timelines for regulatory filings.” To strengthen business continuity, the Company “aims to develop additional sources of manufacture for all steps of our manufacturing processes at the time of, or shortly after, marketing approval,” though single-source dependencies remain for certain recently launched products. The reliance on third parties such as contract research organizations “reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities,” and “if clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities might significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of these clinical trials.” The Company has “adopted a business continuity plan to address most crises,” yet acknowledges that if it “is unable to fully implement our business continuity plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data and/or an inability to perform vital corporate functions,” leading to “a significant disruption in our research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities.” Information technology dependence also poses resilience risks as “the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems makes such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches,” with “a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems” capable of causing “breaches of data security and loss of critical data” and materially adversely affecting the business. The Company’s financial resilience is managed through a “credit agreement providing for a $500 million revolving facility,” foreign exchange hedges and cash balance management, although the agreement’s “negative covenants … may restrict us from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business.” Operating in foreign countries further exposes the organization to “risks related to operating in foreign countries,” including “differing regulatory requirements,” “political instability” and “differing levels of enforcement and/or recognition of contractual and intellectual property rights,” which may disrupt operations and impair organizational flexibility. Finally, compliance with extensive health-care fraud and abuse laws, environmental regulations, data privacy requirements and potential product liability claims adds complexity to risk mitigation and requires ongoing resource allocation to preserve the Company’s integrity and performance under challenging and uncertain conditions.

The annual report acknowledges that “unforeseen events beyond our control, such as oil prices, stock market volatility, terrorist attacks, unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters … pandemics and epidemics … political instability, changes in economic conditions … trade disputes … changes in immigration policies or travel-related accidents can disrupt travel, limit the ability or willingness of travelers … and therefore demand for our services,” and that because “the full impact of their effects is largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior,” the company maintains “redundant systems and hosting services,” “encryption and authentication technologies” and “routinely increase[s] our security-related expenditures” to “protect against security breaches,” including phishing, account takeover and “denial-of-service” attacks, even as it concedes it “does not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses” nor “a completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region.”  The company relies on “multiple internet connectivity routes” and “third-party distribution channels” while recognizing that a partner’s “cessation of distribution” or “deterioration in performance” could adversely affect operations, and it has entered into a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, employs derivative instruments to hedge short-term currency fluctuations and pre-pays certain liabilities to “earn prepayment discounts,” all as strategic responses intended to preserve functioning, operational flexibility and financial resources, reconfigure trajectories under pressure and adapt to challenging conditions.

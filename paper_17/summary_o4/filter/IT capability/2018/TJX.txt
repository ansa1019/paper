The company’s resilience is reflected in its opportunistic buying strategy—operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns—which requires merchants to react effectively to frequently changing opportunities and trends and to assess the desirability, timing, quantity, price and mix of merchandise; its business continuity is supported by ongoing investments in existing and new distribution centers and in information technology systems, related back-up systems, and policies, procedures and controls designed to reduce the risk of data security compromises, disruptions or failures; it maintains operational flexibility by appropriately allocating and delivering merchandise to stores, maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store and being flexible in its allocation of floor space among product categories to meet customer demand; it prepares for and responds to disruptive events such as natural disasters, pandemics or acts of war or terrorism by planning for the possibility of store or distribution center closures, rerouting supply chains, and communicating additional procedures to associates, as well as realigning its European supply chain to reduce cross-border flows in anticipation of Brexit; its expansion into new geographic regions, product lines and channels involves managing complex operations, compliance with local customs, laws and regulations, developing infrastructure and partners, and ensuring consistent implementation of systems, controls, practices and policies across banners and jurisdictions; the company invests in internal training and development for key associates, including its buying organization, to support absorption of strain and preserve functioning under resource constraints; it seeks to forecast sales and align expenses, control costs and adjust them to actual results, and maintain strong operating cash flows to support general operations, growth, stock repurchases, dividends and debt repayments; and it employs hedging strategies, including inventory-related derivative instruments and fuel and currency hedges, to mitigate risks associated with transportation costs, commodity price volatility and currency exchange fluctuations, all of which collectively enable the organization to preserve or improve performance and maintain positive adjustment under challenging internal and external conditions.

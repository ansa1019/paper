The annual report identifies a broad spectrum of operational and strategic risks that bear directly on the company’s capacity to maintain performance and adapt under adverse conditions, including its dependence on a limited set of key products (notably HIV and HCV therapies) and significant exposure to shifts in treatment paradigms, reimbursement levels and formulary coverage; the necessity to “scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development efforts” if revenues decline; persistent global pricing pressures that “could result in larger discounts or rebates” and unpredictable shifts in patient starts; fluctuations in inventory levels held by wholesalers and non-retailer customers that “can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly”; the complexity of forecasting demand and accurately estimating rebates, which “may cause an adjustment to our product revenues”; the risk that “new issues with respect to safety, resistance and interactions with other drugs may arise” and require label changes or sales halts; intense competition and the prospect of generic entry that may “adversely affect our results of operations and stock price”; frequent legislative and regulatory actions that introduce uncertainty—and in some cases “could materially and adversely affect our business”—requiring changes in pricing, reimbursement and utilization management; the critical importance of maintaining compliance with extensive FDA, EMA and other regulations to avoid “restrictions on our products, including withdrawal of the products from the market” or delays in commercialization; reliance on third-party contract research organizations, apheresis centers, couriers, contract manufacturers and supply-chain partners, for which “disputes or disruptions” could delay clinical trials, manufacturing or product delivery; vulnerability to “business interruptions stemming from natural or man-made disasters” and seismically active locations that may trigger uninsured losses; dependency on information technology systems and data, which are “inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack,” and compliance with evolving data privacy requirements such as GDPR; and ongoing litigation, government investigations and intellectual property challenges that demand significant resources and can “harm our reputation, disrupt our business or adversely affect our results of operations.” Together, these disclosures illustrate the company’s ongoing efforts to foresee, confront and mitigate a diverse range of external disturbances and internal constraints in order to preserve integrity, maintain operational continuity and sustain firm performance under challenging conditions.

The company’s risk‐factor disclosures emphasize its ongoing efforts to anticipate, assess and mitigate a wide range of internal and external variations and disturbances—including unknown or emerging risks—that could impair business operations, financial condition, operating results or credit ratings, and to preserve or improve functioning despite such adversity. To support business continuity and maintain core organizational capabilities under challenging conditions, management has established formal governance processes—such as a business risk and disclosure group and regular certification of SEC reporting—retained external consultants to re‐engineer accounting and financial reporting processes, and instituted procedures to monitor inventory levels in its distribution channels and escalate any compliance concerns. The company’s reliance on critical third parties for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization further requires robust business continuity planning; any failure of these partners to perform to standards, deploy crisis plans, or resolve operational disruptions could materially affect the firm’s performance. Information technology resilience is addressed through extensive investments in cybersecurity protections, continuous monitoring of systems and cyber insurance, yet the company acknowledges that breakdowns or breaches could still interrupt operations. Supply chain resilience is reflected in diversified sourcing strategies and contingency planning for manufacturing plant closures, regulatory approval delays, sole‐source supplier failures, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and new serialization regulations. Financial resilience is supported by substantial cash, cash‐equivalent and marketable securities balances, multiple revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs and forward‐starting interest rate swap options to hedge future funding needs, all designed to provide operational flexibility and resource deployment capacity in the face of market volatility, currency fluctuations, economic and political turbulence (including Brexit) and changes in tax or healthcare regulations. These combined organizational practices and strategic initiatives draw on the company’s dynamic capabilities, risk‐management mechanisms and resource reconfiguration processes to absorb strain, adapt to adverse conditions and sustain performance under pressure.

The company’s risk disclosures describe its significant reliance on global and regional economic conditions, single-sourced or limited component suppliers and outsourcing partners, and warn that disruptions—whether from adverse macroeconomic factors, natural disasters, geopolitical events, pandemics, capacity constraints or supplier insolvencies—could materially disrupt production and distribution, diminish its operational flexibility, and require substantial recovery time and expenditures to resume normal operations. It acknowledges that system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate for all eventualities and that its business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not fully mitigate the impact of internal or external disturbances, including failures, errors, violations, hazards or unexpected conditions. To address these risks, the company invests in manufacturing process equipment held at partner facilities, makes prepayments under long-term supply agreements, maintains inventory and impairment reviews with provisions for obsolete or excess components and cancellation fees, accrues warranty and contingent liabilities, and implements credit-risk monitoring, hedging of foreign-exchange and interest-rate exposures, and insurance programs. It also emphasizes its commitment to strategic resource allocation—through focused research and development expenditures to enable frequent product introductions and transitions, through liquidity management and a capital return program to preserve access to capital, and through legal and regulatory compliance policies—to preserve the integrity and performance of its operations under challenging conditions and enable the reconfiguration of its resources and processes in response to disruption.

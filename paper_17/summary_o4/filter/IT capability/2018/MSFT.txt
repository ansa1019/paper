Microsoft states that providing customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of their systems and the strength of their business continuity management plans, magnifying the potential impact of prolonged service outages on operating results. The company has undertaken cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation, devotes significant resources to develop and deploy its cloud-based strategies, and continuously engineers more secure products and services to defend against evolving cyber threats. It spends substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade technology and network infrastructure in order to handle rising user traffic and service complexity, and maintains an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints. Microsoft uses derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; maintains global compliance programs with policies, training, and internal controls; and manages liquidity through cash flows from operations, short-term investments, and access to capital markets to ensure sufficient resources to fund operating activities, capital expenditures, share repurchases, debt maturities, and other cash commitments for at least the next twelve months and beyond. The company identifies and addresses risks arising from catastrophic events—including seismic, weather, cyberattacks, terrorist acts, and other geopolitical disruptions—that could disrupt critical business and IT systems, and describes business continuity planning and risk mitigation strategies designed to preserve operational flexibility, system integrity, and the ability to recover and maintain functioning under challenging conditions.

The disclosure describes a comprehensive framework for maintaining business continuity and preserving functionality under adverse conditions through contingency planning, crisis-management and resolution strategies, diversified liquidity buffers and stress-testing, and ongoing operational and compliance risk oversight. It highlights “single point of entry” resolution planning that ensures subsidiaries have sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress, and parent-subsidiary funding arrangements that safeguard near-term cash needs. It outlines our ability to obtain cash from diversified sources—including stable deposits, secured financings, central bank facilities and contingent lines of credit—and the use of stress scenarios to assess the impact of market shocks, potential deposit outflows, collateral calls or asset sales on liquidity and capital. The text details our enterprise risk framework, including board- and management-level committees, to set risk appetite, monitor key metrics (such as VaR, stress losses and liquidity coverage ratios) and enforce limits, as well as clear first-line, independent risk management and audit roles that ensure timely identification, measurement, escalation and remediation of operational, market, credit, compliance and reputational risks. It underscores our reliance on robust technology and security controls, backup systems, cyber-attack defenses and data-management processes to mitigate disruptions from technology failures, cyber-attacks or third-party breaches, and the dynamic use of interest-rate, currency, credit and other derivatives to hedge exposures and preserve net interest income under parallel and non-parallel rate shifts. Collectively, these measures embody our capacity to absorb strain, adapt processes and resources, and maintain organizational strength, integrity and performance while confronting market dislocations, regulatory changes, operational failures or unexpected events.

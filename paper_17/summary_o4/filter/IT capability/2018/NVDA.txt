We recognize that business disruptions—from natural disasters, telecommunications failures, cyber‐attacks, pandemics or geopolitical events—could harm our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt critical functions and therefore require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations, and we maintain business continuity planning and disaster recovery processes designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under exceptional conditions. To mitigate evolving cybersecurity threats, we continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features for both our internal systems and those of our customers. We manage supply‐chain resilience by diversifying dependencies on third‐party foundries and subcontractors, negotiating contractual commitments for leading‐edge process technologies and collaborating to resolve yield issues, thereby reducing the risk of production delays and shortages. We align resource deployment with market demand through inventory provisions—writing down excess or obsolete inventory based on inventory levels, purchase commitments and updated demand forecasts—and by accounting for customer program rebates and marketing development funds as reductions to revenue. We preserve operational flexibility and financial stability by maintaining highly rated fixed‐income investments, cash equivalents and marketable securities, supported by revolving credit and commercial paper programs, and we believe our liquidity and anticipated cash flows will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our financial reporting integrity is upheld through rigorous controls over revenue recognition, inventory valuation, tax provisioning and goodwill impairment testing, and our capital allocation—including research and development investments, share repurchases and dividends—is structured to support adaptability, sustain performance under pressure and respond effectively to evolving competitive landscapes.

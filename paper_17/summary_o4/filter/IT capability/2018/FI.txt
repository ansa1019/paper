In our discussion of risk factors and business operations, we acknowledge that external and internal disturbances—ranging from intense competitive pressures and rapid technological change to security incidents, cyberattacks, natural disasters and evolving regulation—pose the potential to materially disrupt our functioning, and we mitigate these by continuously adapting our products and services, investing in technology upgrades and information security controls, and deploying business continuity measures to preserve integrity, availability and trust. We routinely reallocate resources through active portfolio management—acquiring complementary businesses, integrating and divesting units, and entering into transition services agreements—to optimize our capabilities, support recovery, maintain performance under adverse conditions and capture innovation opportunities. Our strategic initiatives, including enhancing client relationships with digital and payment solutions, improving operational effectiveness, and exercising disciplined capital allocation, are structured to foresee and confront disruptive events, reconfigure organizational trajectories, and sustain or improve operating results. We supplement these with robust financing and credit arrangements—such as revolving credit facilities, senior unsecured term loans and bridge financing for major acquisitions—to ensure financial flexibility, support strategic responses, and strengthen our resilience in dynamic market and regulatory environments.

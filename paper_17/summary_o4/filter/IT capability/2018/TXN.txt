TI’s disclosures reflect a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment and preserving integrity under nominal, extreme or exceptional disturbances by orchestrating disciplined resource deployment, strategic agility and risk mitigation across its global operations.  The Company invests more than $1 billion annually in research and development and advanced 300-millimeter manufacturing capacity to sustain a competitive cost structure, ensure consistent product supply and provide operational flexibility in the face of rapid technological change, pricing pressures and shortened product life cycles.  Management emphasizes rigorous forecasting and “our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders,” while maintaining statistical and specific inventory allowances for obsolescence, to absorb strain from fluctuations in customer demand and avoid excess or obsolete stock.  Our broad portfolio, global sales force and direct control of manufacturing capacity underpin resilience against macroeconomic weakness, protectionism, trade tensions, currency fluctuations, geopolitical events, cybersecurity threats, natural disasters and supplier disruptions, all of which are identified as factors that could constrain performance or disrupt continuity.  We preserve financial resilience by generating significant free cash flow from operations, maintaining an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility supporting commercial paper, and adhering to disciplined operating plans and controlled expenses to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and debt service for at least the next twelve months.  During semiconductor market downturns, management remains “disciplined with our operating plan and expenses, while focusing on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages,” thereby reconfiguring organizational responses and reconstituting future growth trajectories.  Compliance with complex domestic and international laws, proactive intellectual property enforcement, diversified consignment inventory programs, and stringent supplier and customer risk assessments further exemplify the Company’s systemic perspective on risk management, business continuity and adaptive strategies to preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external pressures.

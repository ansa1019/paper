Disclosures indicate that “should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations,” and that “we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession,” although they warn that “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.” The company further acknowledges that outsourcing certain functions to third-party service providers and cloud infrastructure “involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements” and that “failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm.” It also notes that “our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or increased government regulation,” and that “our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective,” which could impair data storage, handling and security. Moreover, the report highlights that the organization’s “geographic breadth ... subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks,” including rapidly evolving regulatory regimes, sanctions, privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA, Brexit-related uncertainties and potential expropriation, all of which “could materially interrupt our business operations” and “result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability,” underscoring the need for continuous risk assessment, resource allocation, adaptation strategies and preservation of organizational health and performance under pressure.

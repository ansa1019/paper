While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful; operational risks and data security breaches may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth; we rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems, and if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage; our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption; we depend on our principal offices in New York City and on an increasingly concentrated group of third party vendors for hosting solutions and technologies, and a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption; our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, may not be suitable for new products and strategies and may be subject to security risks, and the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from our current level; in addition, cyber security threats to and attacks on our information technology infrastructure, which may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means, could jeopardize our or our fund investorsâ€™ confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, resulting in significant losses, increased costs, liability to our fund investors and counterparties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage; accordingly, while we employ hedging strategies and derivative instruments to limit our exposure to changes in relative values of investments, unanticipated market changes may result in poorer overall investment performance than if such transactions had not been executed or fully protected against evolving conditions.

Bristol-Myers Squibb’s disclosures describe a range of processes and capabilities that support the maintenance of operations and performance under adverse conditions, including extensive risk-management and business continuity planning across its supply chain, manufacturing, and information-technology infrastructures.  The company relies on internal and external resources—such as diversified manufacturing sites, multiple sourcing strategies, key alliance partners, credit and inventory monitoring agreements with wholesale and direct customers, and two extendable revolving credit facilities—to preserve operational flexibility and manage resource allocation under unexpected market, competitive or environmental disruptions.  It has formalized a governance structure that includes a business risk and disclosure group, policies to limit distributor inventory in alignment with end-user demand, escalation procedures for compliance and crisis response, and ongoing self-monitoring under its SEC and FCPA agreements.  Physical and cyber security measures and industry-standard data-protection investments are maintained to mitigate the impact of potential system break-downs, natural or man-made disasters, counterfeiting, theft, or third-party failures.  The company continually evaluates its capital structure, portfolio balance between early- and late-stage programs, and strategic licensing, acquisition or divestiture transactions to ensure adaptability and resilience in the face of evolving regulatory, operational and market pressures.  These integrated controls, monitoring practices and strategic initiatives are directed at preserving product supply, financial stability and organizational integrity during nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

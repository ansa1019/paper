Amgen discloses that its operations depend on ongoing monitoring of inventory levels, accruals for rebates and chargebacks based on historical and forecasted purchasing patterns, and the use of interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts designated as fair-value and cash-flow hedges to manage foreign exchange and interest rate variability, while its investment policy limits holdings to investment-grade instruments with defined maturity and concentration thresholds. The company has established a commercial paper program and a syndicated revolving credit facility as liquidity backstops, and affirms that existing cash, operating cash flows and financing sources are adequate to satisfy working capital, capital expenditure, debt service and shareholder returns, thereby preserving operational flexibility under varying conditions. Recognizing external pressures—from economic instability in key markets and single-source supplier dependencies to regulatory changes, cybersecurity threats, natural disasters and concentrated distributor and payer relationships—Amgen underscores its transformation and process improvement initiatives, including reducing its geographic footprint and reallocating resources toward innovation and new product launches, as essential strategies for maintaining functioning and performance in the face of disruptions. Reliance on independent clinical investigators, third-party contract manufacturers and logistics providers prompts continuous risk assessments, compliance with pharmacovigilance and regulatory requirements, and contingency planning to avoid supply interruptions or stock-outs. The company also commits substantial resources to research and development to sustain its pipeline, adapts to evolving tax laws and uncertain tax positions through informed actuarial judgments, and manages legal and intellectual property contingencies as part of its comprehensive risk management framework. Collectively, these practices reflect Amgen’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, and preserve or improve functioning under adversity, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

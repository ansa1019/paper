PepsiCo maintains a comprehensive integrated risk management framework, under board and committee oversight, designed to identify, assess, prioritize and address a wide range of strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety and reputational risks in order to preserve and improve its functioning under both nominal and extreme conditions.  A cross-functional, geographically diverse PepsiCo Risk Committee meets regularly with divisional and country risk teams, supported by a centralized Risk Management Office, to monitor internal and external pressures—from adverse weather, natural disasters, cyber incidents, supply chain disruptions, industrial accidents and political instability to shifts in consumer preferences, regulatory changes, commodity-price volatility and currency fluctuations—and to develop mitigation and recovery mechanisms, business continuity plans and contingency resource allocations.  The company’s global operating model and multi-year productivity plans further enhance organizational flexibility by re-engineering manufacturing, distribution and go-to-market systems, automating processes, consolidating facilities, simplifying structures and expanding shared services to reduce costs and improve decision making and responsiveness.  Executive leadership embeds “performance with purpose” into strategic initiatives—focusing on human, environmental and talent sustainability—while disciplined capital allocation and capitalization on consumer trend data fuel innovation and allow PepsiCo to adapt its portfolio, reconfigure trajectories after disruptive events and pursue long-term sustainable growth in volatile, competitive landscapes.

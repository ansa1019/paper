We maintain backup systems and business continuity plans to protect our information systems and data from unauthorized access and to mitigate the risk of business disruption, litigation and regulatory action in the event of system failures or external penetration. Our operations may be disrupted by economic, political, regulatory or other developments, natural disasters, civil unrest, conflict or terrorism, which could impair our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, lead to loss of critical property or equipment, and hinder staffing and management of our global operations. We contract with third parties for manufacturing and services and may be required to replace these providers with our own resources if agreements cannot be renewed on satisfactory terms, potentially increasing our costs. To confront evolving market and regulatory pressures, we seek to develop commercially viable new product technologies and broaden our brand portfolio through innovation, selective acquisitions and strategic business relationships, while recognizing integration and execution risks. Forward-looking statements underlying our strategic plans are based on assumptions we believe prudent, but actual results may vary materially due to unforeseen risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions, and we actively monitor currency fluctuations, tax law changes, regulatory developments and competitive dynamics to adapt our resource allocation, risk mitigation and growth initiatives in support of sustained performance under challenging conditions.

In the semiconductor capital equipment industry, which “is subject to variability” and “characterized by rapid changes in demand,” the company “continuously reassess[es] our strategic resource allocation choices,” “adjust[s] spending and other resources allocated to operating activities” and may employ cost management programs “aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams,” to preserve functioning and margins under adverse conditions; during “periods of rapid growth or decline in demand,” the company faces “significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our work force, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure,” and the success of its “ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively” is critical to maintain continuity; the firm’s resilience mechanisms include continuing to invest in R&D and maintain “extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities” even during revenue declines, conducting periodic impairment reviews of “long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets,” maintaining “sufficient liquidity reserves” and offshore and onshore cash balances to “support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure,” hedging foreign currency and interest rate exposures to manage variability, and preserving flexibility by managing debt covenants, “maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply” and protecting critical information systems against disruptions, thereby supporting its ability to “absorb strain and preserve … functioning despite the presence of adversity” and respond adaptively to environmental perturbations, unexpected conditions, and external pressures.

Despite system redundancy, implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems remain vulnerable to energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber-security attacks, any of which could interrupt operations and result in material disruption and additional costs to remedy damages; we and our unconsolidated co-investment ventures carry property damage, rental loss, windstorm, flood, earthquake, terrorism, commercial general liability and environmental insurance as appropriate for each market, evaluate coverage annually through independent analysis, self-insure certain earthquake exposures and continue to bear responsibility for remediation or monitoring of environmental conditions on divested properties. We pursue a diversified funding strategy to mitigate disruptions in global capital and credit markets, maintain $2.6 billion of undrawn credit facilities, borrow in the functional currency of each borrowing entity where feasible, use derivative contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposure on euro, pound sterling and yen investments, and refinance or repurchase debt opportunistically to lower borrowing costs, extend maturities and manage covenants, acknowledging that hedging and lending arrangements involve fluctuation and counterparty risks. Our liquidity planning and capital allocation process reflects an integrated view of cash generation from net operating income, strategic capital fees and promotes, co-investment venture distributions, property dispositions and equity or debt financings, which we consider sufficient to support anticipated development, acquisitions, operating expenses, debt service and dividend requirements. We rely on the deep industry knowledge of our management team and key employees to preserve continuity, resource our growth initiatives and retain competitive advantage, and we believe the scale and quality of our operating platform, team skills and balance sheet strength enhance our adaptability under varied market conditions. Our development program emphasizes the strategic acquisition and control of well-positioned land, with an owned and managed land bank capable of supporting the development of more than 154 million square feet; in 2015 we stabilized development projects representing $1.8 billion of total estimated investment, with post-stabilization fair values estimated at 32 percent above cost. Operational flexibility is demonstrated by the integration of major acquisitions, such as the KTR portfolio and consolidation of the North American Industrial Fund, with minimal incremental overhead, and through systematic contributions to and dispositions from co-investment ventures to reconfigure our portfolio in line with evolving market dynamics. Our environmental and regulatory compliance framework anticipates changing international laws, and while unanticipated expenditures to comply with new requirements could adversely affect us, we incorporate such contingencies into our risk management and resource allocation processes. Continuous same-store analysis, adjusted to remove the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, shows consistent net operating income growth driven by rising occupancy and rental rates, and structured lease terms that include straight-line revenue recognition, contractual rent increases and recoveries of operating expenses serve to stabilize cash flow under varying market pressures.

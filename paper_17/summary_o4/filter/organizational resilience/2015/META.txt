The Company discloses a broad range of risk factors and operational dependencies that implicate its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions, including the potential for material adverse effects on its business, financial condition, and results of operations if it fails to retain or engage users or if its products become unreliable or untrusted; dependence on the interoperability and reliable performance of its technical infrastructure, data centers, network capacity, mobile operating systems and third-party distribution partners to maintain business continuity and rapid, scalable delivery of its services; exposure to technical outages, security breaches, software vulnerabilities, hacking and phishing attacks that may disrupt services, degrade user experience, damage reputation, or require crisis-response measures; reliance on strategic investment and resource-allocation decisions—such as prioritizing long-term user engagement and product innovation over short-term financial returns and pursuing acquisitions like Oculus VR and WhatsApp—to reconfigure capabilities, deploy financial and human resources, and adapt to evolving competitive, regulatory and market pressures; the necessity of robust risk-mitigation processes for data protection, content management, and compliance with complex U.S. and foreign legal, regulatory and tax regimes; challenges in managing rapid global expansion, significant increases in employee headcount, and the integration of acquired entities while preserving corporate culture, agility and operational flexibility; supply-chain and manufacturing risks for hardware products, including quality issues, inventory fluctuations, and vendor performance; exposure to external shocks such as governmental content restrictions, unfavorable media coverage, or macroeconomic conditions that may require strategic resilience measures; and the importance of maintaining governance structures, stakeholder engagement, and brand integrity as mechanisms for preserving organizational health, systemic integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

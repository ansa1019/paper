The company reports that it continues to improve its transportation plan, add capacity, improve operations at its yards and other facilities, and improve its ability to address surges in demand with adequate resources, thereby mitigating the risk of network congestion and service disruptions when demand exceeds planned capacity. It employs dynamic resource allocation and workforce adjustments to manage dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in customer demand and to resize operations—incorporating higher unit operating costs, equipment storage and workforce changes—to preserve network fluidity and operational efficiency even under reduced volume conditions. Significant investments in technology, including the implementation of positive train control and enhancements to transportation control systems, support strategic resilience by improving safety, network performance and competitive positioning. A multi-faceted approach to safety and risk mitigation—utilizing technology, risk assessment, quality control, training and employee engagement through programs such as Total Safety Culture and Courage to Care—further strengthens operational continuity and incident prevention. The company maintains liquidity and financial flexibility through its receivables securitization facility, revolving credit facility and targeted debt issuances, allowing it to respond effectively to economic disruptions, regulatory changes, severe weather events and other external perturbations. Improved operating metrics—such as a 6 percent increase in average train speed and a 3 percent reduction in terminal dwell time—reflect its adaptability and resourcefulness in optimizing network operations under varying volume conditions. Fuel surcharge programs, which trail fuel price fluctuations by approximately two months, and a capital plan that directs 55 to 60 percent of investments toward renewal and improvement of existing infrastructure while funding technology and commercial facility projects, demonstrate a systemic perspective on maintaining integrity and performance across the network. Early lease buyouts of rolling stock and disciplined share repurchase programs exemplify active reconfiguration of the capital structure to generate resources and reinforce financial resilience in turbulent market conditions.

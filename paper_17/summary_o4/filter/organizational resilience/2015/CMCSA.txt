In our intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments, the company seeks to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by investing in network infrastructure and customer-premise equipment—such as accelerating deployment of the X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways—to increase capacity, enhance service innovation and enable operational flexibility. By growing high-speed internet, business services and launching additional services like home security and automation amid emerging competitors and audience fragmentation, we reconfigure resource deployment to preserve or improve functioning and support business continuity. We develop and maintain a comprehensive security program, monitor third-party vendor stability and secure insurance to mitigate the effects of cyber attacks, power outages, natural disasters and other internal or external disturbances on our network and information systems. Regulatory and intellectual property risk assessment, inter-organizational collaborations—including acquisitions such as Universal Studios Japan—strategic content licensing and diversified distribution platforms further reconstitute our organizational practices and resource needs. Liquidity management through revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs and disciplined capital expenditures underpins recovery capacity and preserves organizational health and resilience under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

The risk factors section states that we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment where new factors emerge unpredictably and the impact on our business and financial condition cannot be predicted; our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions and prolonged negative economic conditions may cause long-lasting changes in consumer discretionary spending behavior, including reduced purchases or trade-downs, which could materially impair our performance. It also highlights the dependency on brand value and the need to preserve quality through rigorous training, support and monitoring of licensees and foodservice operators to avoid business incidents that could erode consumer trust and brand equity. The risk of unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customer, employee and proprietary data is addressed by significant capital investments in security technologies, personnel and credit monitoring services, and by making “significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent breaches,” although these measures cannot guarantee prevention. Our reliance on information technology systems for point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, supply chain management, administrative functions and digital initiatives, and the lack of full redundancy across markets, underscore the importance of robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans, with the disclosure that “if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results.” The section on strategic initiatives emphasizes the need to “create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value” through investments in employees, disciplined global expansion, flexible store formats, product innovation, channel development, licensed partnerships and digital and mobile capabilities, while also identifying factors that may impede implementation—such as labor cost increases, supply chain scalability, licensee partner constraints, customer acceptance, construction costs, real estate availability, contractual negotiations, integration of acquisitions and credit rating deterioration—reflecting the operational complexities of managing growth, ensuring consistent supply of high-quality raw materials, maintaining internal controls and training employees worldwide to deliver a consistent customer experience. Risk factors further address the intense competition across channels and markets, dependence on key operating segments for cash flows, and the growing reliance on our China/Asia Pacific and EMEA segments, where challenges include foreign currency fluctuations, higher operating expenses, regulatory requirements, capital constraints of joint venture partners and licensees, import licensing, limitations on repatriation of funds, and the difficulty of staffing and managing international supply chains given cultural and logistical differences. Commodity price risk is highlighted by the volatility of high-quality arabica coffee and dairy products, with only partial mitigation through price-to-be-fixed supply contracts and hedging activities, and potential disruptions from weather, natural disasters, crop disease, political actions and speculative trading, any of which could prevent us from fulfilling demand or adversely impact profitability. The risk factors also note our sensitivity to factors largely outside our control—such as increases in real estate costs, litigation outcomes, labor discord, terrorism, political instability, social unrest, boycotts, natural disasters and health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places—and to interruptions in our supply chain from roasting plant casualties, logistics service failures, trade restrictions, embargoes, or customs actions, as well as reliance on single or few suppliers whose failure to meet standards could disrupt our business. Our management’s discussion and analysis describes the market risk management policy used to quantify and mitigate commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity price risk and interest rate risk through derivative instruments and hedging strategies, and the active management of cash and investments to fund operating needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, supported by credit facilities and a commercial paper program to ensure liquidity. Lastly, the description of contractual obligations—including operating lease commitments, build-to-suit arrangements, green coffee purchase commitments and other long-term liabilities—coupled with the expectation to fund these obligations with operating cash flows, further underscores the company’s focus on maintaining financial flexibility and operational continuity in the face of internal and external pressures.

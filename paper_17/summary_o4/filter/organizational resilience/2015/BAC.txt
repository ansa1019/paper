Bank of America’s 10-K describes a comprehensive enterprise risk framework designed to sustain the firm’s functioning and financial health under internal or external stresses, reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The framework encompasses board-approved strategic and capital planning, a detailed risk appetite statement, and a three-lines-of-defense model that integrates front-line units, independent risk management and corporate audit to identify, measure, monitor and control credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, reputational and strategic risks.  The firm conducts regular stress testing—both historical and hypothetical—across a range of severe scenarios, maintains a liquidity buffer of high-quality unencumbered assets, and holds excess liquidity at the parent and key subsidiaries, with contingency funding plans, recovery and resolution planning (including a single point of entry strategy) and the lcr and slr under Basel III to ensure operational flexibility, business continuity and the capacity to absorb sudden shocks.  Organizational resilience is further supported by global compliance and operational risk programs that include risk-and-control self-assessments, key risk indicators, and rigorous cybersecurity and data management controls; proactive credit risk management across consumer and commercial portfolios; asset-liability management using hedges and liquidity diversification; robust governance, with board oversight via the enterprise risk and audit committees; and ongoing initiatives to adapt capital, liquidity and funding strategies, all of which evidence the firm’s ability to adapt, reconfigure resources and preserve its integrity and performance in the face of adversity.

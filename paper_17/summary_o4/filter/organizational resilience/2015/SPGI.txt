The annual report discloses that the company has established comprehensive business continuity and disaster-recovery plans and regularly assesses and improves these plans and key management succession to maintain operations under adverse conditions, expressly recognizing that local or regional disasters—such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, pandemics, security breaches, cyber-attacks, power losses or telecommunications failures—could materially interrupt its operations if its personnel, office facilities or computer, telecommunications and related systems are unavailable or malfunction.  It acknowledges the dependence of its electronic delivery of products and services on network systems and the internet, notes that unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access could significantly disrupt service and harm its reputation, and states that its disaster-recovery plans, including backup facilities, are not always fully redundant and may not always be sufficient or effective.  The company further recognizes that outsourcing certain support functions to third-party service providers can yield cost efficiencies and specialized capabilities but may expose it to business disruption, processing inefficiencies or harm to employee morale if such providers do not perform effectively.  The report outlines a layered risk-management framework covering exposures to litigation, regulatory proceedings and investigations that could result in adverse judgments, fines or activity restrictions, and describes ongoing controls, policies, procedures and employee training designed to deter prohibited practices under complex U.S., European and other international laws.  It also identifies potential operational interruptions stemming from disruptions in the infrastructure supporting its global operations—including risks from human error, sabotage, acts of terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters—and notes that a disaster of significant scale or affecting key operating areas could cause material financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.  These disclosures implicitly reflect the organization’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal or external disturbances by maintaining continuity plans, redundancies where feasible, compliance programs, and strategic deployment of resources across its business segments.

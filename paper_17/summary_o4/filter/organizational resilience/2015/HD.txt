The Company acknowledges that intense competitive pressures and a changing competitive landscape require that it “adapt effectively and quickly” and “respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions,” while “managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience.” It recognizes the need to “continually anticipate and adapt to” technological shifts such as increased online and mobile usage, implementing programs like BOSS, BOPIS and direct fulfillment, and regularly reviewing and updating processes to protect against evolving cybersecurity threats, even as it concedes that “there is no guarantee” these measures “will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches.” The Company further notes that “disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could adversely impact our business” and that the implementation of supply chain and technology initiatives such as “Project Sync” and the new COM system “could disrupt our operations in the near term” and might “fail altogether,” risks it seeks to mitigate through “continuous operational improvement in the stores and our supply chain, disciplined capital allocation” and by maintaining strong liquidity—including $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and access to commercial paper programs and credit facilities. It also emphasizes the establishment of “processes and procedures” to manage regulatory, third-party and operational risks in areas such as installation services, human capital and international operations, warning that an “inability to timely and appropriately respond” to these external pressures or “to maintain our systems effectively” could adversely affect market share, financial performance and business continuity.

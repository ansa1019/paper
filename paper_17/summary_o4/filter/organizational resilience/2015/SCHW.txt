The company’s board‐approved enterprise risk management framework defines risk appetite and assigns accountability through a Global Risk Committee and specialized functional sub‐committees (including asset‐liability management, compliance risk, credit and market risk, new products risk, operational risk, information security, model governance, and vendor management) to identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate risks that could disrupt business continuity or impair performance. Operational resilience is bolstered by maintaining dual data centers with backup and recovery facilities, disaster recovery testing, periodic risk self‐assessments and internal audits, advanced security monitoring and controls against fraud and cyber threats, and structured response procedures for operational failures or vendor service interruptions. Credit risks are managed through collateral arrangements and lending guidelines, while liquidity and capital resilience are maintained via regular stress testing, oversight of liquidity early‐warning indicators, compliance with the modified LCR rule, and a comprehensive capital contingency plan supported by external financing sources and regulatory recovery‐planning guidelines. These measures are designed to preserve system integrity and the company’s functioning under internal or external variations, safeguard client assets, and enable adaptive reconfiguration of liquidity, capital, and operational resources in response to unforeseen adverse events.

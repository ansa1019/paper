The company’s disclosures describe its risk and insurance services segment, conducted through Marsh and Guy Carpenter, as providing risk management, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions as well as insurance and reinsurance broking services that help clients absorb strain and maintain business continuity under internal and external pressures. The company discloses that it relies on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks and that damage or interruption—from cyber-attacks, advanced persistent threats, malware, vendor or third-party breaches, or failures in security safeguards such as encryption or patch deployment—could materially disrupt operations, impair its ability to serve clients and divert management and personnel resources. It states that extended service outages or business continuity failures occasioned by disasters, pandemics, natural catastrophes, terrorist attacks, power or telecommunications losses could result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory action, reputational harm or legal liability, and accordingly it regularly assesses and seeks to improve its disaster recovery and business continuity plans and key management succession. The company further explains that its processes for establishing liabilities for errors and omissions claims involve case-level reviews by counsel, internal actuarial analysis and other analyses under FASB ASC 450-20, and that macroeconomic, political, legal and regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, technological disruptions and the challenges of integrating acquired businesses require continuous adaptation, resource allocation, risk assessment, contingency planning and operational flexibility to preserve organizational health and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

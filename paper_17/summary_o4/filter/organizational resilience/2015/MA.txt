We maintain an information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage (each reviewed by our board of directors and its audit committee), and our processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection, in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risks; we also periodically test our systems to discover and address any potential vulnerabilities. Service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could materially affect our results of operations, and although we maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks. We rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network, and inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed markets could also result in service disruptions, which could impact our ability to do business in those markets. We are devoting substantial management and financial resources to the defense of interchange fees in regulatory proceedings, litigation and legislative activity, and we have policies, procedures and controls designed to comply with applicable AML and OFAC sanctions requirements, including obligating our customers to screen cardholders and merchants against OFAC sanctions lists. Mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry, recognizing that the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries. In order to successfully compete in such an environment, we and our customers would each need to adjust our strategies accordingly. The company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, its cash flow generating capabilities, its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential obligations, and it may borrow and repay amounts under the commercial paper program and credit facility from time to time for business continuity and planning purposes.

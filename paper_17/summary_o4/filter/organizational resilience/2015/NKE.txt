Across its risk disclosures and management discussion, Nike outlines a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience that emphasizes the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through proactive risk assessment, resource allocation and system integrity. The company identifies potential disruptions—ranging from port congestion, natural disasters and political unrest to cyber-security breaches and currency volatility—and seeks to absorb strain and preserve functioning by investing in supply-chain automation, digital capabilities and distribution infrastructure, by centralizing sourcing through the Nike Trading Company, and by enforcing contractor compliance with rigorous codes of conduct. Nike further mitigates transaction and translation exposure via foreign-currency and commodity hedging programs, maintains committed credit facilities, a commercial paper program and business interruption insurance to safeguard liquidity and operational continuity, and employs tax planning and global cash-deployment strategies to ensure the availability of financial resources where needed. Concurrently, the company drives operational flexibility and future orientation by reducing product costs through manufacturing efficiency and innovation, expanding direct-to-consumer channels, optimizing working-capital efficiency, deploying capital effectively, and upholding intellectual property protection and regulatory compliance, all designed to sustain performance, reconfigure trajectories in response to environmental perturbations and emerge stronger from unexpected events.

The report emphasizes that an operational failure in our transaction processing businesses, including our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, could disrupt service delivery, cause data loss or reduced revenue and harm client relationships, and that interruptions of service might require substantial expenses for service credits or remediation and trigger client losses. It warns that failure to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or the marketplace—or unsuccessful technology upgrade efforts—could similarly erode our ability to retain or attract clients. To counter such internal and external pressures, management continues to implement a series of strategic initiatives—active portfolio management, disciplined allocation of capital, operational effectiveness initiatives and differentiation through innovation, particularly in digital channels—to foster scale efficiencies, expense discipline and system integrity. The company also highlights significant ongoing investments to modify and enhance information security and controls in response to evolving cyber threats and to integrate and assimilate acquired businesses while retaining key personnel, thereby preserving our capacity to absorb strain and maintain positive performance under challenging conditions. Financial resilience is supported by proactive debt management—extending and amending our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, refinancing senior notes, term loan amendments and robust cash flow generation—along with substantial share repurchases and dividend policies designed to ensure liquidity and flexibility to meet operating, capital and debt obligations amid market volatility.

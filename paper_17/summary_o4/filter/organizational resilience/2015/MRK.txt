The Form 10-K describes an integrated approach to risk assessment and mitigation that underpins the company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve performance under adverse conditions, including detailed risk factor disclosures that acknowledge the potential for material adverse impacts from patent challenges, lost market exclusivity, regulatory and pricing pressures, global economic and austerity measures and geopolitical and natural disasters such as war, terrorism, social unrest, cyber-attacks and extreme weather events; it emphasizes business continuity through proactive patent litigation, robust research and development investments and external collaborations to sustain its product pipeline, strategic divestitures and portfolio prioritization to deploy resources effectively, disciplined cost management and multi-year restructuring programs that have delivered over $2.5 billion in annual net cost savings, and flexible manufacturing and supply-chain strategies to avoid shutdowns, shortages and delays; it has established comprehensive hedging programs—including foreign exchange put options, forward contracts and interest rate swaps—to minimize the volatility of future foreign currency and interest rate cash flows, and it maintains investment and tax‐contingency reserves for environmental remediation, litigation and cybersecurity threats; and it continually evaluates and adapts its organizational practices—including workforce reductions, site rationalizations and real estate footprint consolidation—while monitoring data, IT infrastructure and third-party relationships to fortify operational resilience and ensure the integrity, flexibility and ongoing performance of its global operations.

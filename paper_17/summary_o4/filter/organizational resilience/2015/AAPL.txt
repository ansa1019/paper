The company discloses that global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect demand for its products and services, and that uncertainty in credit markets, financial institution failures and market volatility could impair its operations by restricting the company’s ability to obtain credit, disrupting outsourcing partners or suppliers, and delaying product development and manufacturing. To mitigate these risks, the company employs derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps, reviews its long-lived assets and marketable securities for impairment, records write-downs for inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, and accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees and warranty costs. It depends on outsourcing partners for component sourcing, final assembly and logistics, maintains prepayments and contractual commitments to secure supply, and invests in manufacturing process equipment held at partners’ facilities to help ensure continuity of operations. The company maintains system redundancy and disaster recovery planning for its information technology systems, devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and authentication technologies, and monitors accounts for unusual activity to guard against outages, cyber-attacks or unauthorized release of personally identifiable information. It also implements policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, carries insurance coverage for cyber risks and other contingencies, and enters indemnification agreements with directors and officers. In addition, the company dedicates resources to research and development, strategic marketing and reseller programs to sustain competitive advantage, manages its liquidity through capital return programs, share repurchases and dividends, and regularly assesses its contractual obligations and deferred tax positions to preserve its capacity to adapt, recover and maintain performance under challenging internal or external pressures.

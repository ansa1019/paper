AMD’s risk disclosures underscore its recognition of the need for maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, warning that “you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously” and that “our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected” by a variety of internal and external pressures.  The company highlights its dependence on external partners—“we rely on GF to manufacture all of our microprocessor and APU products … if GF is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted,” and “we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected”—illustrating both vulnerability and the imperative for resource allocation and risk mitigation.  In response, AMD has pursued operational flexibility and adaptation, stating “we continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts” and that “our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs,” while its restructuring initiatives are described as “focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook.”  The company’s financial strategies reflect business continuity planning—“we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance along with the savings from our restructuring plans and our secured revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations”—and its recognition of environmental turbulence and cyclical downturns, noting “the semiconductor industry … has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand,” and warning that “failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results.”  Finally, AMD emphasizes the importance of continuous innovation and diversification—“the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions”—as core elements of its dynamic capability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

Scholars have defined organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007: 3418); organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity; resilience can be defined as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and its performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances (i.e., pressures, constraints, failures, errors, violations, hazards), whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional; defined as a company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from a challenging situation; the concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source; resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish. Our 10-K risk factors describe that our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock, reflecting external pressures and environmental turbulence; we face intense competition and must continue to innovate and rapidly provide products and services useful to users or risk diminished competitiveness, revenue, and operating results; ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky and may distract management from current operations or fail to deliver anticipated benefits; we continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices to capture dynamic, multi-screen environment opportunities; adverse macroeconomic conditions and reduced advertising spending, intensified regulatory scrutiny and legal and government investigations may force operational changes and incur substantial costs, diversion of management resources, and potential liabilities; acquisitions may cause operating difficulties, integration challenges, cultural and administrative complexities, and unforeseen expenditures; maintaining and enhancing our brand depends on remaining a technology leader and delivering high-quality, innovative products and services; interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems from natural disasters, climate-related events, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks, or other security breaches could result in service interruptions and damage our reputation; our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities and some systems are not fully redundant; reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers exposes our operations to capacity constraints, quality issues, supply shortages, and ethical or compliance failures in our supply chain, which could disrupt our operations, cancel orders, terminate relationships, and harm our reputation; changes in device standards, regulatory requirements, privacy and data protection laws, and foreign exchange volatility require adaptation, hedging strategies, and may necessitate changes in our business practices; internet access providers, government-initiated restrictions, and ad-blocking technologies could restrict, block or degrade access to our products and services, reducing user engagement and advertising revenues; we experience fluctuations in the market values of our investments and our future income taxes and effective tax rates may be adversely affected by changing statutory rates, audit outcomes, and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; our operating results may fluctuate, making period-to-period comparisons less meaningful and unpredictable; as a holding company, Alphabet depends on subsidiaries for cash flows to service obligations and may not realize anticipated benefits of its reorganization or maintain optimal resource allocation; and our workforce, corporate culture, and management focus are critical organizational capabilities that we invest in and must sustain to preserve organizational health, innovation, and strategic agility.

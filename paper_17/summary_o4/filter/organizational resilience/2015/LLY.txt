The company discloses a range of strategies, processes and capabilities intended to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal and external pressures, including the management of research and development spending across its portfolio so that delays or terminations of individual projects do not materially alter total R&D investment; ongoing investments in information security and complex IT systems—such as employee awareness and training, strengthened data protection for third parties, and measures to prevent, detect and respond to breaches, system interruptions from energy or telecommunications failures, natural disasters, terrorism, malware or other malicious intrusions—to maintain operational continuity; monitoring and control of wholesaler inventory levels, diversification of raw material sources and contingency planning for manufacturing difficulties or disruptions at internal and contract facilities to mitigate supply-chain hazards; the use of derivative financial instruments and hedging programs to manage foreign currency and interest-rate exposures, thereby stabilizing revenue, cost of sales and operating expenses; establishment of reserves and self-insurance for product liability, sales returns, rebates, discounts and uncertain tax positions to enhance financial resilience; the integration of acquired businesses and divestiture of non-core assets to reconfigure resources in response to regulatory requirements; and maintenance of liquidity through commercial paper programs, committed bank credit facilities and operating cash flows sufficient to fund capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases—all of which reflect a systemic perspective on organizational resilience as the ability to foresee and confront a variety of challenges, adapt structures and resources, and sustain performance amid volatility and adversity.

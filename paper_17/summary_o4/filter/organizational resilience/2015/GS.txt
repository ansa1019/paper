Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place, we acknowledge that catastrophic events such as natural disasters, war, civil unrest, terrorism, pandemics or extreme weather, and disruptions in the infrastructure that supports our businesses—including electrical, communications, internet, transportation or other service facilities—could impede our ability to occupy offices, travel, communicate or otherwise service and interact with clients and thereby compromise business continuity and recovery efforts. To mitigate these risks, we maintain a comprehensive framework of contingency and liquidity planning, including quarterly balance sheet planning, asset‐liability management and the pre‐funding of global core liquid assets intended to cover modelled cash and collateral outflows under 30-day stress scenarios; we also maintain a contingency funding plan that identifies risk factors, key metrics and escalation protocols, assigns roles and responsibilities for crisis coordination, and details mitigants and action items for prolonged or acute stress. Our operational and technology risk policies feature rigorous daily monitoring of transactions, multi-layered system controls and independent escalation procedures, regular stress testing and scenario analyses, periodic system enhancements and integration testing, intensive training and supervision to reduce human error, and oversight by dedicated risk committees, all designed to preserve system integrity, support rapid reconfiguration of resources, sustain organizational functioning under adverse conditions, and facilitate timely recovery and continuity of client services.

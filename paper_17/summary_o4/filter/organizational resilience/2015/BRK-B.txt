Berkshire and its subsidiaries face a variety of risks and uncertainties that could impair business operations, including dependence on key personnel and the board’s monitored succession plan for its chairman and CEO, a decentralized business model that requires the recruiting and retention of qualified personnel across operating units and regular review of capital strength and liquidity as a competitive advantage. The company employs business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate cyber security and operational disruption risks, while maintaining extraordinary capital strength and redundant liquidity to buffer against economic cycles, regulatory changes and disruptions in capital markets. Operational resilience is supported by ongoing significant capital investments in its railroad and utilities networks to improve capacity, reliability and system integrity, and by decentralized governance with minimal involvement of corporate headquarters in day-to-day operations, complemented by senior management’s oversight of capital allocation and governance “tone at the top.” Strategic responses to competitive and technology pressures include the concentration and diversification of investment portfolios, the willingness to assume larger underwriting risks when appropriately priced, and the proactive use of catastrophe reserves and reinsurance structures designed to absorb strain from extreme event losses. Complementary risk mitigation measures extend to risk assessment and reserve adequacy testing in insurance underwriting, maintenance of statutory surplus and insurance derivative protections, and stress testing of debt capacity through revolving credit facilities to support acquisitions and operational funding. Overall, the integration of capital strength, liquidity management, decentralized operational flexibility, rigorous governance and continuity planning underpins the organization’s ability to preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external pressures and to adapt its trajectory of responses to challenging conditions.

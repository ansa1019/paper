Visa discloses a range of practices, strategies and capabilities reflecting its ability to maintain service reliability and adapt to evolving pressures, including promoting certain practices “to ensure that visa-branded cards are processed over our network,” enhancing “programs and policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-corruption and sanctions regulations,” and making pricing and resource-allocation adjustments—such as reducing fees or increasing the payments and other incentives provided to issuers, acquirers or merchants—in response to regulatory changes. It describes its treasury policies that “provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk,” its investment portfolio “designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs,” its commercial paper program and its unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility to support operational continuity, and its view that “cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs.” It indemnifies issuers and acquirers “for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund its settlement obligations,” and it pursues strategic acquisitions—such as the proposed acquisition of Visa Europe—while acknowledging “added costs and challenges in operating our business in certain territories” and the need to ensure system interoperability and manage integration risks. Visa recognizes the threat that “processing or other technology malfunctions, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in long-distance or local telecommunications access, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorism, effects of climate change or other catastrophic events may disrupt or compromise our transaction processing systems,” that failure “to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards … could reduce the use of our products and harm our business,” and that its dependence on third-party vendors and diverse regulatory regimes can “impair our business and reputation” if not anticipated, thereby reflecting an organizational focus on risk mitigation, operational flexibility and performance maintenance under challenging conditions.

In evaluating our business, we note that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, recognizing exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates, and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and accrued government rebates and chargebacks based on historical utilization rates, channel inventory data and market assessments. We provide significant discounts or rebates to public and private payers to obtain formulary status and expand patient access, and continually review and prioritize R&D activities based on scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential and available human and capital resources. Due to our reliance on independent third-party contract research organizations for clinical studies, we acknowledge limitations in direct control over trial timing, conduct, expense and quality, and we depend on single-source suppliers and limited manufacturing capacity subject to regulatory inspections and good manufacturing practices compliance that, if unmet, could delay or halt commercialization. We are mindful of business-continuity risks from natural or man-made disasters—our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities are in seismically active areas—and we invest in information-technology safeguards against service interruptions, malicious intrusion and data breaches. To ensure adequate capital resources and operational continuity, we believe our existing cash balances, together with operating cash flows and authorized stock repurchase and dividend programs, will satisfy foreseeable capital needs, while we adapt to pricing pressures, competitive product launches, regulatory changes, healthcare reforms and global economic uncertainties to preserve our integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

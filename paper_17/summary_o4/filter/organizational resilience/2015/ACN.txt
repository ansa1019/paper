The company anticipates continuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures to enhance its service offerings and expand into new geographic and sector markets, with the potential to increase investment in such transactions as opportunities arise, while acknowledging that failure to identify suitable candidates or to complete and integrate acquired businesses could disrupt ongoing operations, divert management attention, require additional management and other resources, and strain its organizational structureâ€”making it difficult to efficiently assimilate and retain employees, institutionalize knowledge, maintain culture, and communicate core values across more than 358,000 worldwide staff. It recognizes that its size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges, including maintaining effective standards and internal controls, thereby increasing the risk of employee misconduct, breaches of confidentiality or compliance failures, and that entry into markets where it lacks prior experience or faces stronger competitors may expose it to unanticipated financial, legal and operational risks. The company further notes that acquisitions or joint ventures may incur substantial severance, benefit, impairment, litigation and advisory costs, any of which could adversely affect profitability, and it emphasizes the necessity of developing and implementing appropriate processes and tools to manage enterprise-wide operations, mitigate transition and integration risks, and sustain business continuity and performance under evolving internal and external pressures.

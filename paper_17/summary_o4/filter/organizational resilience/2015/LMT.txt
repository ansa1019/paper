Lockheed Martin’s 10-K highlights that its operations are subject to diverse risks and uncertainties—ranging from U.S. government funding constraints and budgetary sequestration to evolving procurement policies, cybersecurity threats, supply-chain disruptions and environmental remediation liabilities—which the company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate, although such risks cannot be entirely eliminated or predicted and could materially affect its operating results, cash flows and business continuity.  Management emphasizes the need for operational flexibility and adaptability, noting that changes in the business environment require the company to evolve its business models, processes and products, adjust workforce levels through severance and consolidation initiatives, pursue program realignments and strategic portfolio shaping (including technology investments, acquisitions such as Sikorsky, divestitures and facility optimization) and extend into adjacent and international markets to optimize resource allocation, sustain performance and maintain competitive advantage amidst market fragmentation and increased price-driven re-competition.  To preserve its functioning under adversity, the company describes proactive measures such as securing adequate program funding and performance-based payment mechanisms, maintaining strong customer relationships, managing integration and synergies from transactions, investing in technology and human capital, leveraging strong operating cash flows, and maintaining access to diversified financing, all of which support its ability to absorb strain, deploy resources effectively and adapt to internal and external perturbations while pursuing strategic foresight and future orientation.

Nextera Energy and its subsidiaries recognize that the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions requires comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation across all facets of their operations; they identify a wide spectrum of internal and external pressures—from severe weather events such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes and droughts to cyber-attacks, terrorist threats, equipment failures, fuel supply disruptions, market price volatility, regulatory changes, litigation, environmental constraints and credit risks—and have established business-continuity and resilience strategies that include regulatory fuel and cost recovery clauses, reserve amortization mechanisms, derivative-based hedging programs, diversified insurance and decommissioning funds, extensive credit facilities and liquidity management, collateral posting under master netting agreements, and capital allocation for system upgrades and modernizations (including repowering, nuclear and solar projects and infrastructure hardening).  They continuously adapt to evolving federal and state regulations and incentives, manage project development, siting and permitting complexities, allocate financial and human resources to critical maintenance and capital initiatives, and leverage operational flexibility—through real-time trading and marketing functions, contingency planning for unplanned and extended outages, and structured emergency management protocols—to preserve reliability, reconfigure operations after disruptions, recover storm restoration costs through regulatory mechanisms and sustain performance, growth and competitive advantage in turbulent markets.

The company discloses that it has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure, sales, marketing, personnel and facilities to support anticipated growth and business continuity as it enters and expands in new geographic markets, even though “when we make these investments it is typically unclear whether, and when, sales in the new market will justify our investments, and we may significantly underestimate the level of investment and time required to be successful.” Although security measures are designed “to protect customer information and prevent data loss,” they may “be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise,” and “if we suffer a cyber-security event we may lose customers, lose future sales, experience business interruption and injury to our competitive position, and incur significant liabilities.” The company’s services are hosted in equipment managed by it and co-located in third-party data centers that are “vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss and similar events” and “we cannot rapidly switch to new data centers or move customers from one data center to another in the event of any such adverse event,” despite maintaining “crisis management and disaster response plans.” It warns that “disruptions in our services could damage our customers’ businesses, subject us to substantial liability, and harm our reputation and financial results,” as well as “reduce our revenues, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, subject us to claims and litigation, cause our customers to delay payment or terminate or fail to renew their subscriptions, and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers.” The company also notes that if it is “unable to continuously enhance our products and services to deliver consumer product-like experiences, mobility, messaging and ease of use, they could become less competitive or obsolete and our business and operating results will be adversely affected.” Further challenges include operating in “fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive” markets subject to pricing pressures, evolving data privacy, internet commerce and data sovereignty regulations that could “restrict our ability to store, process and share data with our customers,” global economic and foreign currency fluctuations that could “negatively impact actual prices…or the effective prices we realize,” and the risk of legal disputes that could “divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and harm our financial condition and operating results.”

Lowe’s has developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect its business, supported by a risk management framework administered by its chief risk officer which includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures. The company’s strategic initiatives emphasize adaptation of its business concept to rapidly changing retailing environments and shifting customer shopping habits, demands and demographics, requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization, program sequencing, workforce transformation and the development of new competencies to deliver omni-channel capabilities. Investments in customer-facing technology systems, disaster recovery planning and information security are intended to maintain system integrity and functionality in the face of cyber-attacks, distributed denial of service events, hardware failures and regulatory changes, while self-insurance programs and vendor security measures further protect against data breaches, extended protection plan exposures and third-party service disruptions. Operational resilience is strengthened through workforce management—hiring, training, managing and retaining qualified, culturally competent sales associates, specialists and support staff—effective management of third-party installers, suppliers and supply chain networks to mitigate procurement interruptions, and the capacity to adjust fulfillment networks amid environmental, labor and logistical contingencies. Strategic resilience extends to managing complex integrations, such as the Rona acquisition, maintaining effective internal controls during geographic and functional expansions, complying with evolving laws across jurisdictions, preserving liquidity and credit strength through open market debt issuances, revolving credit facilities, share repurchases and dividends, and ensuring ongoing capital investments in existing stores, technology infrastructure and distribution networks to sustain performance, maintain continuity, and preserve organizational strength and adaptability under challenging conditions.

The report cautions that business interruption or failure of information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of products and services, damage the company’s reputation and harm financial results, noting that it “does not have redundancy for all of our systems,” that “many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers,” and that “our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities,” with the potential for “prolonged interruptions” to cause lost customers, additional refunds, negative publicity and increased operating costs.  It describes ongoing investments and management attention to “upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our high-availability capabilities,” to migrate “our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and to third party hosted environments,” and to coordinate with external service providers, regulators and law enforcement to “protect our customers from fraud,” recognizing that “techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time” and that security measures “cannot provide absolute security.”  The company further acknowledges its vulnerability to a wide range of internal and external disturbances—including natural disasters, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, terrorist attacks and other events beyond its control—and notes that it does not carry earthquake insurance for quake-exposed facilities.  In describing its strategic response to rapid technological change and intense competition, the report emphasizes the need to “invest significant resources in our product development, marketing and sales capabilities,” to “develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies,” to expand “third party technology relationships and strategic partnerships,” and to transition toward more connected services, all with the aim of adapting to disruptions, maintaining operational flexibility, mitigating risks, ensuring business continuity, and preserving or improving functioning under challenging conditions.

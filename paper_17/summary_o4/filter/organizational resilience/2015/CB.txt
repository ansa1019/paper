Chubb Limited’s organizational documents employ a dispersed ownership structure and voting‐power limitations designed to mitigate the risk of an unintended inclusion of Subpart F income under U.S. controlled foreign corporation rules, thereby preserving financial and operational continuity and protecting shareholder investment against potential IRS challenges and court rulings that could otherwise impose adverse tax consequences and impair firm performance.

The Company’s disclosures describe a broad spectrum of internal and external pressures—from global economic downturns, credit market disruptions, sovereign debt concerns, volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs to natural disasters, internet security threats, epidemic outbreaks and evolving regulatory requirements—that may compromise business continuity, strain manufacturing scale‐up, disrupt supply chains and installed base support, and delay capital sales cycles. In response, the Company employs risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration measures such as foreign currency hedging, quality and corrective action processes, service contract renewals, distributor management, multi‐jurisdictional regulatory compliance programs and targeted training initiatives to preserve operational flexibility and integrity, sustain system utilization, and maintain revenue streams. The 10-K further notes the reliance on single‐sourced components, geographically dispersed operations, critical personnel and collaborative arrangements, any failure of which could necessitate reconstituting processes, shifting resource allocation or activating contingency plans to absorb strain, adapt to adverse conditions, and recover performance under pressure, thereby reflecting a systemic perspective on maintaining organizational resilience amid uncertainty and disruptive change.

KKR’s 2020 annual report repeatedly underscores the severe global disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, describing pandemic-driven stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions and social-distancing measures that imposed a major simultaneous supply- and demand-shock on regional and national economies, heightened volatility in equity, credit and commodity markets, and rendered historical comparisons of little value while materially increasing the risk and uncertainty of business decisions.  In response, the firm implemented remote-working arrangements, a formal business-continuity plan to protect employee health and ensure operational continuity, and contingency plans for key personnel, while also investing in digital and technological capabilities to maintain core processes.  Despite these mitigation efforts, the report cautions that disruptions to its financial, accounting and data-processing systems, cyber-security breaches, failures of concentrated third-party service providers, or physical access restrictions to its main office could materially impair its ability to operate.  The firm describes an enterprise-wide risk-management framework that employs scenario analyses and quarterly fair-value reviews, including independent valuation firm procedures, to assess and price market, credit, operational and regulatory risks, but acknowledges that single points of failure—such as reliance on a small number of key investment professionals, critical technology, or centralized infrastructure—could magnify strain.  Regulatory changes, evolving accounting and capital standards, collateral and reinsurance recapture triggers, and tax-related uncertainties further increase the complexity of maintaining adequate capital and reserves.  KKR highlights the importance of diversifying distribution partners and funding sources, effectively hedging exposures with derivatives and structured transactions, managing liquidity through committed facilities and repurchase agreements, and preserving organizational health through talent retention, succession planning and flexible deployment of resources—all measures aimed at preserving or enhancing the firm’s ability to absorb stress, adapt to changing environments and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

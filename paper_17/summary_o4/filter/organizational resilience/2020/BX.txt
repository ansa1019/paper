The risk factors disclosure describes organizational resilience in practice by highlighting the firm’s need to maintain continuity and adapt under adverse conditions; for example, “the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns or limitations in the operations of certain non-essential businesses have created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and prospects materially,” and it warns that “failure of our investment strategies to adapt to these and other changes could adversely impact the returns on our investments.”  The report notes that “in accordance with local government guidance and social distancing recommendations, the majority of our employees globally have been working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic,” and that “while our technology infrastructure has supported remote work, such working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks,” underscoring operational flexibility coupled with risk mitigation and cybersecurity measures.  It also acknowledges that “a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses…could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption,” and concedes that “our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption,” thereby addressing crisis management, emergency preparedness and resource allocation for continuity.  In response to market volatility and external pressures, management warns that “we may need to reduce our fixed costs and other expenses in order to maintain profitability,” reflecting reconfiguration of resources and strategic cost management, and further notes that “difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.”  Throughout, the firm points to systemic dependencies—on information systems, third-party service providers, funding markets and regulatory environments—and describes both the potential “internal or external variations and disturbances” it faces and its ongoing efforts at “risk assessment,” “operational continuity,” “cybersecurity,” and “regulatory cooperation” as mechanisms of resilience under challenging conditions.

Amgen has activated its applicable business continuity plans, including suspending U.S. in-person meetings and international travel and transitioning U.S. employees who are able to work from home since mid-March 2020, while deploying COVID-19-related support programs for staff, suppliers and customers that, notwithstanding increased operating expenses and reduced efficiency, are intended to preserve critical functions and maintain operations under challenging conditions. The pandemic’s effects on the health and availability of our workforce, the suspension of clinical trial enrollment at certain sites, and disruptions in public and private infrastructure—including transportation networks, supply chains and third-party service providers—have prompted adaptive resource allocation, shifts in manufacturing processes, reliance on backup power at our Puerto Rico facility and contingency planning for sole-source raw materials and distribution centers to mitigate supply constraints, stock-outs and regulatory approval delays. To protect against cyber-threats, Amgen continues to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of its sophisticated information technology systems—encompassing software, cloud services, network-connected control systems and data privacy measures—to guard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its critical and sensitive data in the face of increasing ransomware, social engineering attacks and service interruptions. These measures, together with ongoing risk management and pharmacovigilance programs (including periodic REMS assessments), cross-functional collaboration, strategic foresight and dynamic capacity planning, are designed to maintain organizational integrity, preserve performance under pressure and reconstitute operational trajectories in response to external pressures, extreme conditions and unexpected events.

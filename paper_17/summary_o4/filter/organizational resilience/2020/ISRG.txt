The Company acknowledges that additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate amplify existing risks, causing significant and unpredictable reductions in demand, delays in elective procedures, temporary facility closures, restricted travel, supply chain disruptions, and delays in regulatory approvals or clinical studies, any of which could impede its ability to operate, deploy systems, access employees and resources, and meet capital expenditure or service obligations. Public health crises or epidemic diseases, or the perception of their effects, have had and could continue to materially adversely affect operations, and natural disasters or other events beyond the Company’s control could disrupt business continuity and lead to lost revenue or increased expenses. Dependence on sole- or single-sourced suppliers, distributors, and component manufacturers exposes the Company to risks of supply disruptions, quality deviations, cost increases, and production delays, while regulatory changes, government shutdowns, and evolving international standards may necessitate operational scale-backs until compliance is achieved. To mitigate these pressures, the Company has established programs to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents; implemented customer relief measures including service fee credits, payment deferrals, and extended terms; and continues to invest in manufacturing automation, supply chain resilience, product transitions, and quality systems, even as it recognizes that capacity constraints may require expensing fixed overhead and reduce gross margins. It also maintains health and safety policies, monitors global economic and geopolitical developments—including industry consolidation—and adjusts strategic initiatives and resource allocation to preserve organizational flexibility, adapt to dynamic operating parameters, and sustain performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

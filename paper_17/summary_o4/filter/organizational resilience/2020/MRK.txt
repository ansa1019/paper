The company’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining continuity and performance under internal and external pressures, including the implementation of a global restructuring program to optimize its manufacturing and supply network and reduce its real estate footprint—actions expected to yield approximately $900 million in annual net cost savings by the end of 2023—and ongoing evaluations of its operating model to identify further improvements. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Merck reports that its workforce across all divisions continued to enroll and maintain clinical studies, advance its pipeline and safeguard the supply of, and patient access to, its medicines and vaccines despite an estimated $2.5 billion negative impact on sales and anticipates residual disruptions to persist into 2021, particularly for vaccine products. The company also highlights risks to operational flexibility posed by manufacturing delays, reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements, cyber-attacks—including a significant 2017 network disruption—and social media channels, and it details efforts to enhance the speed of recovery of its sophisticated IT systems and protect critical data to enable continued business operations during and after such events. To mitigate financial volatility, Merck has established revenue hedging, balance-sheet and net investment hedging programs using forward contracts, currency options and euro-denominated debt, and employs interest rate swaps to manage benchmark rate exposure, thereby smoothing foreign exchange and interest rate impacts on future cash flows. Additional resilience measures include proactive risk management in emerging markets, workforce retention initiatives, inventory and distribution controls, environmental remediation accruals, accounts receivable factoring arrangements, diversified financing through debt issuances and share repurchases, and periodic impairment assessments of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets—together reflecting an integrated system of strategic foresight, resource reallocation and risk mitigation designed to preserve organizational integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

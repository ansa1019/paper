The company acknowledges that disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to its warehouses, adversely affecting sales and member satisfaction, and therefore depends on the orderly operation of its merchandise receiving and distribution processes and supporting facilities; it further recognizes that failure or disruption of its information technology systems—from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or employee errors to catastrophic events—could impair its ability to procure, produce, move and sell goods, and is accordingly undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects and making significant investments to enhance its digital resiliency and cybersecurity posture to prevent and recover from such disruptions; the Covid-19 pandemic has strained global supply chains, fluctuated member demand and imposed public health measures that could disrupt operations or reduce consumer confidence, prompting the company to take precautionary measures such as requiring remote work arrangements, temporarily increasing employee compensation and sanitation measures, reconfiguring inventory sourcing and distribution trajectories, and exploring alternate suppliers despite potential cost and transportation penalties; the company has also made and may continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of its supply chains, relies on self-insurance, reinsurance and bank credit facilities to mitigate financial exposures, and leverages its membership format, omnichannel and e-commerce capabilities, private-label penetration, co-branded credit card program and strategic warehouse expansion to adapt to competitive pressures, economic and regulatory uncertainties, currency fluctuations and climate-related risks, all of which are critical to its ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and maintain performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

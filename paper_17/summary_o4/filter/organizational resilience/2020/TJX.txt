The Company has confronted the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by temporarily closing and reopening stores, distribution centers and e-commerce sites worldwide while continuing to incur essential operating expenses and paying associates throughout furloughs, reflecting a commitment to business continuity and maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. It implemented enhanced health and safety protocols, including social‐distancing measures, occupancy limits, protective equipment and rigorous cleaning regimens, and established global task forces to coordinate operational flexibility and rapid response to evolving restrictions. To mitigate supply‐chain disruptions, the Company negotiated rent deferrals, extended payment terms with vendors, reconfigured its European logistics network in light of Brexit, and realigned inventory management through opportunistic buying, markdown strategies, and frequent inventory turns to preserve performance despite fluctuations in demand and internal variations. Financial resilience was reinforced by generating strong operating cash flows, issuing $4 billion of notes, establishing a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, suspending share repurchases, maintaining dividend payments, and deploying cost‐saving initiatives to bolster liquidity and fund capital expenditures. The Company also conducted impairment assessments and recorded asset writedowns for leased stores affected by prolonged closures, demonstrating risk assessment and adaptive resource allocation. Investments in information technology disaster recovery plans and enhanced cybersecurity defenses further underpin its capacity to absorb strain, reconstitute trajectories of response, and preserve system integrity and performance under external disturbances.

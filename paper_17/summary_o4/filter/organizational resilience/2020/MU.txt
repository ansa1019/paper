The Company describes its organizational resilience in its Risk Factors and Management’s Discussion by detailing how it has maintained positive adjustment under the adversity of the COVID-19 outbreak through a range of mitigation and continuity measures: it enacted health screenings, physical-distancing protocols, quarantines, remote work policies, visitor restrictions and mandatory mask use to protect its workforce while sustaining facility operations; it reallocated supply from depressed markets (such as smartphones, consumer electronics and automotive) toward areas of heightened demand (including data center, cloud server, notebook and gaming applications); it evaluated its supply chain to identify and remediate gaps by securing alternative suppliers and increasing on-hand inventories of critical materials; it added assembly and test capacity to create redundant manufacturing capability through both captive operations and external partners; it adjusted construction and project schedules with enhanced safety protocols; and it developed strategic response scenarios—such as limitations on new hiring, business travel and discretionary spending—to prepare for varied economic outcomes.  These actions, together with ongoing engagement with governmental authorities to ensure compliance with evolving requirements and industry best practices, are designed to absorb strain, preserve and restore production continuity, and enable the enterprise to adapt, recover and emerge stronger under prolonged, extreme or recurring disruptions.

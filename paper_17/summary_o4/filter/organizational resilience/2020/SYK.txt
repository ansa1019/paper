In its 2020 Form 10-K, the company discloses that the COVID-19 pandemic has “materially adversely affected” its operations, supply chain, manufacturing, product distribution and other business activities and has driven a “significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted and continues to shift,” including the postponement of elective medical procedures, allocation of manufacturing capacity under governmental orders, modification of distribution channels and workforce measures such as furloughs and remote working arrangements. It highlights the establishment and use of revolving credit facilities, strong investment-grade ratings and derivative instruments to “readily access capital markets at competitive rates,” supporting short-term liquidity and operating needs from cash from operations, commercial paper and expense reduction actions. The company reports continuing its long-term capital allocation strategy by “investing $4,222 in acquisitions,” paying dividends, suspending share repurchases and exercising its right to increase permitted leverage to 5.0 to 1 to maintain financial flexibility. It describes business continuity measures including the development of business continuity plans for key information technology systems, implementation of a new global ERP system, insurance programs covering property, casualty and cybersecurity losses and the management of sole-source supplier dependencies to preserve operational continuity. The disclosure further notes the monitoring of goodwill and intangible assets through annual impairment testing, the evaluation of income tax positions across multiple jurisdictions and the review of long-lived assets for recoverability as mechanisms to ensure system integrity and adaptive resource reconfiguration under uncertain and extreme conditions.

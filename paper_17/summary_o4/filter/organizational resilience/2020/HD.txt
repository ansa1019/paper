In its Item 1A and Item 7 disclosures, the company details resilience-oriented strategies including significant investments in its “one supply chain” and “one Home Depot experience” to streamline operations, reconfigure resources and maintain operational continuity, while acknowledging that failure to manage the volume, timing, nature and cost of these initiatives or adapt quickly to competitive pressures may disrupt operations and harm financial performance. It describes adjustments to its store network—maintenance of aging facilities, space reallocation and the introduction of localized merchandise assortments—and delivery innovations such as BOPIS, curbside pickup and direct fulfillment to absorb supply chain shocks and meet evolving customer demands. The report outlines its COVID-19 response as prioritizing associate and customer safety and community needs through modified store hours, customer capacity limits, remote support operations, enhanced associate compensation and safety protocols, and elevated liquidity via deferred capital expenditures and expanded credit facilities. Supply chain resilience measures address potential disruptions from extreme weather, pandemics, trade disputes and labor shortages, while information technology resilience focuses on preserving data integrity and system availability against outages, cyber-attacks and design errors. The company further emphasizes talent management, organizational change processes, integration of strategic transactions and retention of a skilled workforce to sustain service quality and adapt to shifting business environments. Combined, these disclosures demonstrate an ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and reconstitute resources under internal and external disturbances, reflecting organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

In response to the novel coronavirus pandemic and broader macroeconomic uncertainty, the Company has implemented numerous measures to support business continuity and preserve functioning under challenging conditions, including restricting employee travel, modifying work locations with remote work arrangements, cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and complying with government‐mandated travel bans, quarantines and facility shutdowns across its global manufacturing operations. These actions have been reinforced by a diversified footprint spanning the United States, the Philippines, Ireland, Singapore, Malaysia, China and India; continual monitoring of disruptions in transportation, border controls and vendor operations; active management of liquidity through cash and cash equivalents maintained with high‐credit‐quality counterparties; reviews of available funds in foreign subsidiaries; and access to a $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. The Company employs foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non‐U.S. dollar exposures, maintains a balance between internal manufacturing and third‐party wafer foundry, assembly and test services, and conducts ongoing risk assessments of its supply chain to mitigate the impact of natural disasters, public health emergencies and political or regulatory changes. In anticipation of, and during, the proposed acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., substantial integration planning and resource allocation have been undertaken to align processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems, while operating under merger covenants that restrict certain actions and demand sustained management focus, all with the objective of maintaining organizational health, operational flexibility and performance amid internal and external pressures.

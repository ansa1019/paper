The Company recognizes the importance of maintaining operational resilience through comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery planning, noting that “clients, regulators and others may require specific business continuity and disaster recovery plans including frequent testing of such plans,” the implementation of which “may require a significant investment of time and money.” It further acknowledges that “operational failures and resulting interruptions in the implementation or availability of our products or services could harm our business and reputation,” and warns that “in the event of operational failures or damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully or quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets and data through our business continuity program.” The Company also highlights the necessity of robust information security, stating that any “unauthorized access, intrusion, infiltration, network disruption, denial of service or similar incident could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or data,” and that it “expects to continue to invest significant resources to maintain and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.” The interconnected nature of the global financial system is cited as a potential source of disruption—“disruptions of operations of other participants in the global financial system could prevent us from delivering our products and services” despite collaboration efforts to mitigate such risks—and the Company cautions that reliance on third parties for critical services means that if “these third parties fail to perform these services adequately, our business may be materially and adversely affected,” including the possibility that “we may no longer be able to provide certain services to customers.” The risk of technology failures is similarly highlighted: “we may experience software defects, development delays or installation difficulties” that “could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients or client data.” In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company describes adaptive measures—“requiring a majority of our employees to work remotely, suspending non-essential travel, suspending all non-essential visitors to our facilities, disinfecting facilities and workspaces extensively and frequently, providing personal protective equipment to associates and requiring employees who must be present at our facilities to adhere to a variety of safety protocols”—while acknowledging that “there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic,” and that the pandemic could create “challenges to the availability and reliability of our solutions and services due to changes to normal operations.” Finally, the Company underscores the need to “anticipate and respond to [technological] changes in order to remain competitive within our relevant markets,” reflecting a commitment to resource allocation, risk mitigation and strategic adaptation to preserve organizational functionality under adverse and rapidly evolving conditions.

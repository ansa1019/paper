The Company acknowledges that its global operations “are subject to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,” which “has created significant volatility, uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption, resulting in an economic slowdown of potentially extended duration”; it reports that “we have experienced significant and unpredictable reductions as well as increases in demand for certain of our products,” that continuing travel restrictions “would significantly impact our ability to support our sites and customers … and … hamper our products from moving through the supply chain,” and that “our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees” and that “we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures”; it states that “while we are staying in close communication with our sites, employees, customers and suppliers and acting to mitigate the impact of this dynamic and evolving situation, the duration and extent of the effect of COVID-19 on the Company is not determinable”; it further notes that “the Company has mobilized to support the COVID-19 response with products and services that help diagnose the virus as well as assisting customers to develop potential therapeutics and vaccines” and that “several of the Company’s businesses have had an increase in revenues due to sales of products addressing diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19,” though “the duration and extent of future revenues from such sales are uncertain and dependent primarily on customer testing demand”; the Company identifies operational resilience strategies, stating “we must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive” and outlining measures “strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; expanding our service offerings; continuing key customer initiatives; combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively; finding new markets for our products; and continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities”; it discloses supply chain and IT continuity risks, acknowledging that “our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply … could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies” and that supply chains “could also be disrupted by … natural disasters, pandemic health issues such as COVID-19, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes”; moreover, it warns that a “significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business,” that “certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality,” and that despite precautions, such problems “could result in … interruptions in our services”; in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the Company reports it “mobilized in early 2020 to support the COVID-19 pandemic response … however, the Company saw a significant reduction in customer activity … that materially adversely affected … operations,” that “the extent and duration of the negative impacts … are uncertain and dependent in part on the success of global efforts to control the pandemic and economic activity ramping up,” and describes ongoing “strategic growth investments”—“targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, expanded service and operational infrastructure, focused research and development projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience”—alongside “productivity improvements … from its practical process improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low-cost region manufacturing.”

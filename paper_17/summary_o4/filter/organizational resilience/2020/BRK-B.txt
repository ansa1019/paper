Although our operations are subject to a wide range of internal and external pressures, we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to address cyber‐security threats and other disruptive events, and maintain ample liquidity in cash, cash equivalents and treasury bills, insisting on safety over yield and avoiding common stock repurchases that would reduce consolidated liquid resources below $20 billion.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our businesses implemented various business continuity plans to protect employees and customers—temporarily closing nonessential facilities, adopting work-from-home arrangements, staggered and reduced work schedules, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, employee health screenings, elimination of nonessential travel and meetings, and general health reminders—and took actions to mitigate economic losses through furloughs, wage reductions, capital spending cuts and restructuring activities to resize operations in line with expected demand.  We manage our unusually decentralized operating model with few centralized functions, relying on autonomous subsidiary management to direct day-to-day activities while senior corporate management retains responsibility for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and chief executive selection, thereby preserving operational flexibility and resilience.  Recognizing the critical importance of leadership continuity, the board has identified qualified successors to key personnel, continually monitors this risk and believes that the board’s succession plan, together with the numerous highly diversified operating units, enhances our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions.  Our insurance businesses employ disciplined underwriting practices designed to mitigate potential catastrophe losses by considering all possible correlations and maintaining aggregate exposures significantly below predetermined thresholds, reinforcing our competitive advantage of large statutory surplus and claims-paying ability ratings.  Overall, these strategic initiatives—spanning crisis response, resource reallocation, risk assessment and mitigation, and organizational adaptation—support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation of integrity and performance despite internal or external disturbances.

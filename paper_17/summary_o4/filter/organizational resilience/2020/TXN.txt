TIâ€™s Form 10-K describes a range of organizational processes and capabilities designed to maintain performance and integrity under internal or external disturbances, including macroeconomic weakness, trade tensions, pandemics, natural disasters, cybersecurity threats and supply-chain constraints. The company has long maintained a business continuity plan for unforeseeable situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic and has modified its business practices in response to evolving government and third-party measures, while investing in inventory buildup and an expanded globally owned manufacturing footprint to provide operational flexibility and enable production across multiple sites to minimize disruptions. TI emphasizes strong cash flow from operations as its primary source of liquidity, disciplined capital allocation to R&D, manufacturing capacity and strategic acquisitions, and a revolving credit facility and short-term investments to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and debt-related obligations, thereby preserving resilience under pressure. Management continually monitors and assesses geopolitical, social, economic and regulatory risks, reallocates resources to support critical operations, adapts organizational and manufacturing processes as conditions evolve and reconstitutes financial and operational trajectories toward future objectives, reflecting a multifaceted approach to sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

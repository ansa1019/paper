In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed most of our offices worldwide, encouraged our employees to work remotely, implemented travel restrictions and canceled or shifted customer, industry and employee events to virtual-only experiences, focusing on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities and preparing for the future, while acknowledging potential operational and workplace culture challenges and additional costs or liabilities associated with safely reopening offices under varying health protocols. We released four emergency response applications and a suite of tools designed to help companies manage essential steps for returning employees to the workplace and to support their health and safety, and we revised our external guidance to investors to reflect pandemic impacts and the longer-term effects on our office environment, remote working and innovation. Our operations and service availability remain subject to disruptions from pandemics, natural disasters—including seismic events near our California and Washington facilities—flooding, fires, power shortages, climate-related hazards, terrorism, political unrest, telecommunications failures, vendor supply-chain interruptions, cyber-attacks and other external pressures, and although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, devote significant financial and personnel resources to data center capacity and security measures, and use derivative instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, we recognize that our insurance coverage may be insufficient, that cybersecurity threats may increase as our global workforce and third parties work remotely on less secure systems, and that the effectiveness, extent and duration of government responses, vaccine distribution, economic recovery and other developments will remain highly uncertain and could materially affect our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve our functioning and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our businesses activated their business continuity plans, developed and applied return-to-work protocols and modified practices—such as requiring employees to work from home, suspending non-essential travel and canceling physical meetings—to help maintain workforce health and safety while preserving operational continuity under challenging conditions. We engaged closely with suppliers to identify and mitigate adverse impacts on our supply chains and distribution systems, addressed capacity constraints and price increases, and reallocated manufacturing resources—sometimes at the direction of governments under the U.S. Defense Production Act—to ensure the timely production and delivery of medical and other critical supplies. As part of our enterprise risk-management framework, we maintain robust disaster recovery planning and system redundancy for our information-technology systems, enforce cybersecurity controls and data privacy policies, employ cross-currency and interest-rate hedging instruments to manage financial exposures, and continually reassess and, where necessary, restructure or divest business units to align with our strategic objectives. We leverage our geographic and industry diversification, ongoing productivity and DBS cost-improvement initiatives, and access to liquidity via commercial paper and committed credit facilities to sustain cash flows, support capital expenditures, fund strategic acquisitions and investments, and respond flexibly to evolving demand, regulatory changes and market volatility. These measures, together with continuous monitoring of external pressures and proactive scenario planning, reflect our commitment to absorbing strain, maintaining core functioning and emerging stronger from disruptive events in accordance with our definition of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under adverse conditions.

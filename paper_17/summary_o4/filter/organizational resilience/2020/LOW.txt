In our Item 1A – Risk Factors the company identifies its dependence on the ability to adapt its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment by addressing changing shopping habits, demands and demographics, warning that failure to adapt or realize the benefits of organizational change initiatives—including large, complex programs requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing—may adversely affect results of operations. Management emphasizes the critical importance of operational flexibility and business continuity, noting that our success depends on anticipating and responding to economic, social and technological trends, attracting, retaining and developing skilled professionals to support strategic initiatives such as omni-channel sales and marketing, supply chain transformation and digital platform investments, and maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit facilities to absorb strain under pressure. The risk discussion further cautions that disruptions in our domestic or international supply chain, fulfillment network, vendor relationships or technology systems—including cybersecurity incidents, system outages or failure to implement disaster recovery plans—could interrupt operations, impair customer experience and materially impact financial performance. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company rapidly re-prioritized objectives to protect associates and customers through enhanced safety protocols, rolled out curbside pickup, mobile check-in, order-picking apps and BOPIS lockers, re-platformed lowes.com to the cloud to improve site stability and functionality, invested nearly $1.3 billion in COVID-related support, reset U.S. store layouts to deliver faster, localized product assortments, and launched a total home strategy to intensify focus on professional customers, modernize installation services and expand online capabilities—all measures intended to absorb disruptions, reconfigure resources and preserve or improve functioning under exceptional conditions while maintaining the flexibility to manage and adapt in a dynamic economic environment.

The disclosures describe a range of operational and strategic actions that support the company’s ability to absorb strain and maintain its functioning under adversity, including measures to safeguard business continuity in the face of external disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to protect employees and ensure the reliability of manufacturing and distribution systems, and the implementation of virtual interactions and pausing or resuming clinical trial activities to reduce strain on healthcare systems. The company has taken steps to maintain a reliable supply of medicines, to support patient access and affordability, and to develop COVID-19 treatments under expedited authorization processes, while acknowledging that evolving variants and competitive therapies may adversely affect demand. It has also highlighted its ongoing risk-management program, which employs derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, and describes periodic reviews and enhancements of information technology systems to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical data, detect and respond to cyber-attacks, and enhance IT system resiliency. The firm continuously evaluates its liquidity and capital resources—cash, cash equivalents, operating cash flow, access to borrowings, and investment levels—to ensure adequate funding of working capital, R&D programs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and contingency obligations, while noting that prolonged economic downturns, supply-chain disruptions, or partner defaults could impair collections and increase counterparty risk. Portfolio management practices are described, including diversification of research and development expenditures across multiple projects to mitigate the impact of delays or failures in any single program, as well as strategic acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing arrangements designed to bolster the product pipeline and organizational capabilities. The company further conducts periodic impairment reviews of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets when events suggest their carrying value may no longer be recoverable, and maintains contingencies for litigation and product-liability claims, reflecting its ongoing adjustments to evolving regulatory, market, and legal pressures.

In our risk factors and management discussion, we describe a comprehensive suite of disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans designed to protect against natural disasters, pandemics, power or communication failures, system interruptions, data center or cloud‐computing service disruptions, and vendor or supply‐chain failures, while acknowledging that such preparations may not prevent or mitigate every loss of client data, service interruption, operational disruption, or facility damage. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we activated our business continuity plan to shift over 98% of our workforce to remote locations to ensure uninterrupted service, implemented more than 1,000 product feature changes in response to 2,000 legislative updates across 60 countries, supported clients in running over 2 million Paycheck Protection Program reports, and provided a one-time global associate assistance payment to preserve employee well-being. We maintain robust information security policies, procedures, and controls to monitor, prevent, detect, and respond to cyber and data protection incidents, recognizing the evolving sophistication of threats and potential challenges in anticipating and containing unauthorized access or system degradation. Our client funds investment strategy employs laddered maturities of investment-grade securities and short-term financing arrangements—including a high-quality commercial paper program, reverse repurchase agreements, and committed credit facilities—to average through interest‐rate cycles, ensure liquidity for client obligations, and minimize volatility, while we use derivative instruments and diversified portfolios to manage market, credit, and foreign currency risks. We are executing broad-based transformation and digital implementation initiatives to streamline our organization, optimize procurement and workforce resources, enhance technology platforms, and drive operating efficiencies, margin improvement, and long-term growth. Our strong cash flow generation, low capital intensity, disciplined capital structure, and active management of debt issuance and redemption provide resilience against economic downturns and market volatility. We continuously review and enhance governance, compliance, and risk-mitigation measures—from anti-corruption and sanctions to privacy, healthcare reform, and regulatory changes—to uphold organizational integrity, maintain performance under challenging conditions, and sustain our strategic objectives.

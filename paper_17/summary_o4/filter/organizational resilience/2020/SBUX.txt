Throughout the risk factors section, the company acknowledges that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted its ability to carry out operations as usual, impeding business continuity through temporary store closures, modified hours and health protocols, supply-chain interruptions, and volatility in financial markets that could limit access to capital and trigger impairment charges. To mitigate these internal and external variations and to preserve or improve functioning, the company implemented significant actions such as leveraging CARES Act and Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy programs as offsets to operating expenses, extending flexible development and financial terms for licensees, and accelerating digital and contactless service innovations. The report describes strategic initiatives designed to enable positive adjustment under challenging conditions: optimizing the North America store portfolio by blending flexible formats, expanding convenience-led formats reliant on mobile ordering, adjusting rapidly to changing customer behaviors, reconfiguring its mix of licensed versus company-owned stores, creating new daypart opportunities with product innovation, simplifying store administrative tasks to bolster labor productivity, and scaling global supply-chain and channel-development partnerships to enhance flexibility and resource deployment. Starbucks emphasizes its risk-management and resilience mechanisms, including incident response, disaster-recovery and business-continuity plans, technology safeguards against cyber threats, diversified short-term and long-term liquidity sources through credit facilities and commercial paper, market and commodity hedge programs, and prudent cash-investment strategies to maintain operational resources and strategic agility. In its management’s discussion, the company reports sequential improvements in comparable store sales in both the Americas and international segments as transaction volumes rise following re-openings, reflecting “the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand” as it absorbs strain, adapts to evolving conditions, and seeks to emerge stronger from adversity.

Prologis discloses that, as a global company, it confronts social, political and economic risks in multiple geographies and seeks to preserve its operational integrity by establishing controls and procedures to monitor compliance with regulations, by hedging foreign currency and interest‐rate exposures through borrowing in local currencies and derivative instruments and by annually evaluating insurance programs against perils such as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake, terrorism and cyber incidents, while recognizing that uninsured or underinsured losses could cause significant disruption and resource constraints; in managing financial resilience the company mitigates disruptions in capital and credit markets by diversifying financing sources, extending debt maturities through refinancing, maintaining substantial credit facility availability and generating liquidity through property dispositions, contributions to co‐investment ventures and alternative capital measures to satisfy REIT distribution requirements, acknowledging that adverse market conditions may require resource reconfiguration such as divesting properties at less than optimal terms or restructuring leases; Prologis emphasizes its business continuity and crisis response capabilities, asserting that its business continuity plans, communication protocols, remote working technology and local property teams enabled it to maintain rent collections, operating fundamentals and customer support during the Covid-19 pandemic while providing grants, supplies and space for relief; further, the company highlights its strategic foresight in assessing climate-related risks and potential environmental liabilities, managing equity commitments to co-investment ventures and recognizing that deficiencies in internal controls, reliance on key personnel and evolving regulatory or market conditions may affect its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

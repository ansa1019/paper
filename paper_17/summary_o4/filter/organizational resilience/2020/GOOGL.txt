Google’s operations depend on the continuing operation and resilience of its complex information technology and communications systems, which are vulnerable to interruption from terrorist attacks, natural disasters or pandemics (including COVID-19), climate-related hazards such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity, power loss, telecommunications failures, hardware or software errors, viruses, ransomware and denial-of-service attacks, as well as break-ins, sabotage, or vandalism at data centers, some of which are not fully redundant and for which disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities, any of which could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and lengthen service interruptions. The Company faces supply chain disruptions and increased costs due to raw material, component or part availability constraints, manufacturing capacity limitations, labor shortages, industry allocations, tariffs, trade disputes, pandemics, and climate change, compounded by reliance on single or limited sources of supply, long-term purchase commitments, and the need to reconfigure production and distribution operations, all of which could impair operational continuity and resource utilization. Violations of laws or ethical practices by suppliers and business partners concerning workplace and employment, data security, environmental compliance, or intellectual property licensing could trigger supply chain failures, canceled orders, and reputation damage, challenging the maintenance of organizational health. The Company’s financial performance is subject to cyclical advertising spending and shifting user behavior under adverse macroeconomic conditions, including the continuing impacts of COVID-19, which have caused fluctuations in demand that may impair revenue and cash flows. To compete in a rapidly evolving and intensely competitive environment, the Company must anticipate technology developments, allocate resources to research and development, pursue service innovation, execute acquisitions and strategic investments, and adjust its product mix, all while mitigating risks of operational disruption, diversion of management attention, and unanticipated liabilities. The implementation of a new global ERP system and the adoption of remote work measures to address COVID-19 have required significant changes to internal controls, oversight mechanisms, and compliance processes, underscoring the need for operational flexibility and adaptive strategies. Regulatory pressures, including antitrust complaints, data privacy and content moderation obligations, anti-corruption enforcement, and evolving tax and trade regulations, necessitate dynamic compliance, risk assessment, and reconfiguration of business practices to preserve integrity and performance under challenging conditions, thereby reflecting the organization’s capacity to absorb strain and maintain continuity, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances.

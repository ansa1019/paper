Amazon’s disclosures recognize that demand for its products and services can fluctuate significantly in response to natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events, seasonality and unforeseeable events, placing significant strain on its management, personnel, operations, systems, fulfillment network, logistics, supply chain, transportation, purchasing and third-party seller processes. The company acknowledges occasional system interruptions and delays that make its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond, and notes that its systems are not fully redundant and its disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to prevent or fully mitigate such disruptions. In response to evolving internal and external pressures, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon has modified numerous aspects of its logistics, transportation, supply chain, purchasing and third-party seller processes; implemented enhanced cleaning, physical distancing, personal protective equipment and temperature checks; and hired over 400,000 employees to increase fulfillment network capacity. The company regularly evaluates its facility requirements and seeks to expand and optimize its fulfillment network to maintain in-stock inventory levels, meet anticipated shipment volumes, reduce variable costs per unit, negotiate improved supplier terms and achieve better operating efficiencies. Amazon also invests in technology and content—leveraging advances in processing power, data storage, analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning—to enhance customer experience, improve process efficiency and support new and existing products and services, including substantial ongoing investment in AWS infrastructure. It relies on a limited number of shipping companies and third-party technology providers, and acknowledges that supply chain, staffing and infrastructure complexities can limit its operational flexibility. Amazon believes that cash flows generated from operations, together with its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet its anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months, but cautions that unanticipated consequences of the pandemic, system interruptions, data security breaches, market volatility and other external disturbances could materially affect its liquidity, capital resources and ability to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

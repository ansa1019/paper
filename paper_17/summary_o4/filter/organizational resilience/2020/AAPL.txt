The company’s disclosures describe a range of measures and challenges that bear on its capacity for organizational resilience, including the observation that “the covid-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets” and that, “following the initial outbreak of the virus, the company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply shortages that affected sales worldwide.” During the pandemic the company “has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely,” and its retail stores and channel partner points of sale “have been temporarily closed at various times” and, “where stores and points of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers.” The company “is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities.” In the context of information technology and operations, it acknowledges that “system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities” and that it “is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.” To counter these risks the “company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data” and it “monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances to help protect customers and the company.” The report also notes that “many of the company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters,” that “global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects,” and that “such events could make it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the company’s service offerings.” It further recognizes that “following an interruption to its business, the company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.” On liquidity and financial risk, the company states that “existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months,” and that it “has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the notes and into foreign currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the notes.” In supply-chain management the company “utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products” under demand-based forecasts, and it warns that “if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the company’s products, a change in the company’s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company’s products, the company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees.”

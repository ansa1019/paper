The Company asserts that its “ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements,” including addressing “labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control,” because failure to manage and remedy such disruptions “could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.” It further emphasizes managing “fluctuations in the prices of commodities and raw materials … through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions” and driving “productivity improvement across all elements of cost, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending and non-manufacturing overhead” as critical to resource reconfiguration under adverse pressures. The Company highlights that the “ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits.” In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it prioritizes “protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges,” while managing both “significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products” and “inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements,” all without material net impact to consolidated sales, net earnings and cash flows. It also underlines the necessity of robust “business continuity plans” to address cybersecurity breaches, operational outages and “inadvertent disclosure of … sensitive business or stakeholder information,” and describes organizational design changes to enhance decision-making, resource deployment and system integrity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions—measures that together support the maintenance of performance and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

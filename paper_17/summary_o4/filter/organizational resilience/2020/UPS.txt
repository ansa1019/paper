UPS emphasizes its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity by detailing how the COVID-19 pandemic “resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, a substantial curtailment of business activities, weakened economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, both in the United States and abroad,” and warning that “the impact of the pandemic will depend on evolving factors, many of which are not within our control, and to which we may not be able to effectively respond.” The company describes risk-mitigation measures such as indexed fuel surcharges and hedging transactions to “mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices,” ongoing investments in “technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans,” and reliance on information‐technology networks and systems “to manage or support a wide variety of important business processes and activities throughout our operations.” It also uses derivative instruments to “monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates,” maintains liquidity through “cash from operations, access to commercial paper programs and capital markets,” and pursues a transformation strategy to “transform nearly every aspect of our business” and enhance core capabilities. UPS further underscores its business-continuity planning for “severe weather conditions or other natural or manmade disasters” that “have in the past and may in the future disrupt our business and result in decreased revenues” and could “result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business,” illustrating its focus on adaptation and transformational resilience under unexpected conditions.

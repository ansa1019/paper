Visa’s disclosures reflect a multifaceted approach to maintaining organizational resilience through the continual enhancement of compliance programs and policies as regulations evolve, the capacity to rapidly adjust product offerings, services, fees and other important aspects of our business across diverse jurisdictions, and the operational flexibility evidenced by modifications to business practices—restricting employee travel, implementing office closures, shifting to remote work and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences—in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The company regularly evaluates cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, maintains treasury policies designed to manage liquidity risk, ensures the timely completion of payments settlement activities, makes planned capital investments, pays dividends and repurchases shares, and invests excess cash in securities, resulting in $7.7 billion of available liquidity as of September 30, 2020, to fund daily settlement and contingencies such as merchant or acquirer settlement failures. Risk mitigation mechanisms include indemnification arrangements and the use of U.S. and Europe retrospective responsibility plans—backed by a litigation escrow account—to insulate Visa from covered litigation losses, while admission of potential liabilities and periodic reassessment of accruals demonstrate a systemic perspective on risk assessment and resource allocation. The description of evolving competitive and technological pressures—including the development and participation in alternate payment networks and new payment technologies, the need to adapt to mobile, e-commerce and faster payment initiatives, and the evaluation of strategic acquisitions and investments—further underscores Visa’s dynamic capabilities, resource reconfiguration, and future orientation aimed at preserving or improving functioning and ensuring performance maintenance under challenging conditions.

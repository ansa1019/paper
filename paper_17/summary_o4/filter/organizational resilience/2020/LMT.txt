Lockheed Martin’s disclosures emphasize its ability to maintain positive adjustment and continuity under challenging conditions, as demonstrated by measures adopted throughout 2020 to sustain operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The company reports that it “has taken measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, work with our customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions and support our community in addressing the challenges posed by this ongoing global pandemic,” and that it “continues to proactively monitor our supply chain and has implemented multiple actions to help mitigate the effects of COVID-19, including accelerating payments to suppliers.”  In response to supplier delays affecting F-35 production, Lockheed Martin “tapered our production rate” and anticipates resuming a pre-COVID-19 tempo in 2021, illustrating operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration.  The 10-K further describes Lockheed Martin’s systematic risk management processes at both the consolidated and segment levels, including the identification and monitoring of “risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract” and the recognition of “risk retirements” when conditions improve, thereby adjusting profit-booking rates to reflect the partial maintenance of performance under varying pressures.  Backlog management is presented as a buffer against future uncertainty, with $147.1 billion at year-end 2020 “converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made” and 39 percent expected to be recognized over the next twelve months.  Strategic portfolio shaping through acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures is described as an active capability-enhancement mechanism, with Lockheed Martin noting that it “selectively pursues the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio.”  In managing postretirement benefit plans, the company has “purchased irrevocable group annuity contracts” to “eliminate future volatility” of pension liabilities, locking in costs to preserve system integrity under financial perturbations.  Finally, Lockheed Martin’s contract accounting policies are designed to recover allowable costs and “provide reasonable assurance” of cost recovery plus profit, thereby integrating risk assessment, resource allocation and customer-funded research and development into a systemic perspective on resilience and continuity of performance.

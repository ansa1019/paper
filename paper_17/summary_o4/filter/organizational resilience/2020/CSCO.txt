In its risk disclosures and management’s discussion, Cisco acknowledges that the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures have caused “economic and financial disruptions globally,” including “manufacturing challenges and component constraints” in its supply chain, and states that it “is continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities.” To bolster its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under these adverse conditions, the Company launched a business resiliency program offering $2.5 billion of financing solutions with a 90-day payment holiday and deferral of 95 percent of payments until calendar 2021, realigned its organization through a voluntary early retirement program to enable further investment in key priority areas, and entered into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that “allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us” or that secure manufacturing capacity and “improve manufacturing lead-time performance.” Cisco underscores that “inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence,” has increased component procurement efforts, and leverages its “strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position” alongside committed credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and financed service contracts to maintain operational flexibility and liquidity. The Company further highlights its rapid transition to remote working—“most of our global workforce working from home”—the deployment of free trials of collaboration and security technologies to support distributed teams, investments in intent-based networking and cloud-based software-as-a-service offerings to accelerate customers’ digital transformations, and ongoing cost productivity initiatives, all designed to sustain performance under disruptive change and enable “positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

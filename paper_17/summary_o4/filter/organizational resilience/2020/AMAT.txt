Applied’s 2020 Form 10-K discloses that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated government measures have “adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact” its supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, introducing significant uncertainty about its ability to “maintain manufacturing operations at current levels,” and that the degree of impact depends on factors such as the duration of the pandemic, containment actions and economic recovery. In response, management “responded quickly to put in place precautionary measures to keep its workplaces healthy and safe,” maintaining workplace flexibility through remote work arrangements, keeping critical labs and operations active to support customers, utilising “the minimum number of people to safely execute tasks” onsite under “enhanced safety and health protocols—including screenings, social distancing, and use of personal protective equipment,” and executing a “multi-phase plan to return to working on-site” based on business needs, local regulations, community case trends and public health guidance. The company and its foundation have also addressed immediate humanitarian needs by sharing masks and equipment with medical facilities, providing blood analysis systems to medical professionals and sending emergency support to food banks. Applied acknowledges that its business continuity relies on the timely supply of equipment, services and related products, and that “supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control” may require it to “transfer its business to alternative sources,” which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties and affect its ability to protect and enforce intellectual property. Applied notes that rapid increases in manufacturing capacity or unexpected changes in demand may exacerbate supply chain and working capital pressures and may lead to excess or obsolete inventory charges. The company further highlights that its success “depends in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders,” recognizing that the loss or retirement of knowledgeable and experienced employees may lead to “unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.” Applied also stresses the importance of successfully implementing enterprise resource planning and related information systems to “track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources,” while acknowledging that failures or delays could result in service interruptions and operational difficulties. Finally, Applied notes that “cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability,” and active collaboration with employees, customers and suppliers, support its ability to satisfy liquidity requirements over the next twelve months.

In its 10-K the company repeatedly describes its efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, noting that it “attempt[s] to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls, risk models, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance,” and that it holds a “cash balance, highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection” to “provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands.” The firm emphasizes business continuity planning by adopting remote work capabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic while acknowledging “no assurance that our ability to continue to function in this environment will not be adversely affected by an extended disruption,” and it discloses contingency planning for telecommunications and infrastructure outages. A disciplined underwriting process ensures that “only policies which adequately compensate us for the risk we accept” are written, losses are limited through geographic zone and program size restrictions and excess-of-loss reinsurance layers, and catastrophe exposures are managed via regular reviews, stress-tested probable maximum loss models, and a multi-layered reinsurance program. The investment strategy reflects a systemic perspective and dynamic capabilities, stressing “diversification of risks and conservation of principal and liquidity” under strict portfolio guidelines, and collateral structures, including letters of credit, support statutory reserves and mitigate counterparty credit risk. The company establishes actuarially based reserves for unpaid losses and adjusts for prior period development and expected credit losses “based on a default analysis,” demonstrating absorptive capacity, risk assessment, and resource allocation to preserve operating flexibility. Organizationally, autonomy is granted to profit centers to foster managerial adaptability and decentralized decision-making, while stress-testing and modeling of exposures recognize that “actual results could differ materially,” underscoring proactive measures, operational flexibility, and system integrity in the face of external disturbances.

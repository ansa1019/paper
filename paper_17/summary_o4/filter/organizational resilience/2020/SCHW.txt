See Risk Management and Capital Management in Part II, Item 7, for a discussion of our risk management governance and processes, which establish policies, procedures and controls for operational, compliance, credit, market and liquidity risk, including a framework for risk identification, assessment, monitoring and mitigation, and periodic control testing and internal audit reviews. The rapid escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic turbulence demonstrated our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning by transitioning the majority of our workforce and certain integration activities to a remote environment, maintaining a backup and recovery infrastructure with geographically dispersed facilities and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and drawing on a well‚Äêestablished incident management program when temporary service interruptions among our outsourced providers contributed to increased response and processing times. We actively monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity through changes in the composition of our investment portfolios and funding sources, conduct regular liquidity and capital stress testing under acute scenarios, and maintain diversified funding, including secured and unsecured credit facilities and a commercial paper program, to ensure compliance with regulatory capital and liquidity requirements and sustain operational continuity under extreme conditions. Our compliance risk management program, information security measures, fraud prevention controls, model risk governance and conduct risk policies further reinforce organizational integrity, while our capital contingency plan and insurance protections mitigate residual losses. Finally, the ongoing acquisition and integration of TD Ameritrade, expected to span 18 to 36 months and involving significant acquisition and integration-related costs, capital expenditures and projected cost synergies, underscores our capacity to reconfigure resources, implement strategic initiatives and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

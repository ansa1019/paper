Throughout its 10-K, NVIDIA underscores its organizational resilience as the maintenance of operational integrity and performance under a range of internal and external pressures by continuously identifying emerging industry changes and dedicating considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments to develop new or enhance existing products, services and technologies that meet evolving customer requirements; by scaling and adapting its supply chain through long-term procurement and capacity commitments, inventory forecasting and process integration—particularly following its Mellanox acquisition—and by developing critical infrastructure for customer support, e-commerce and IP licensing; by engineering more secure products and enhancing security and reliability features to mitigate evolving cyber-threats; by maintaining substantial cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and access to credit facilities to support capital investments, working capital needs and a capital return program; by modifying business practices, enabling a remote workforce, enforcing stringent safety guidelines and adjusting operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and by preparing for and responding to disruptions from natural disasters, extreme weather events, power or water shortages, cyber-attacks, pandemics, geopolitical shifts and other catastrophic events that may require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations.

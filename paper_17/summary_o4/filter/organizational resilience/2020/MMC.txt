The Company’s risk disclosures emphasise its reliance on robust business continuity and disaster recovery frameworks to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity, noting that “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability,” and that “we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession.” The pandemic forced the Company to “modify our business practices (including transitioning substantially all of our colleagues to a remote work environment, restricting colleague travel, developing social distancing plans for our colleagues and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences),” illustrating its adaptive strategies to maintain operational continuity. It further acknowledges the need to “develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption,” investing in and upgrading complex information technology systems and cybersecurity safeguards, while recognising that failure to do so or to maintain adequate access controls and vendor resilience could materially impair performance. The loss of senior leadership or failure “to maintain our corporate culture” is also cited as a factor that could undermine organisational health and effectiveness, prompting strategic initiatives around succession planning, talent retention and ongoing investments in infrastructure and compliance to enable recovery, risk mitigation and maintenance of performance under challenging conditions.

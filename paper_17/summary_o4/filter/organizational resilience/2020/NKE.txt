Nike’s Form 10‐K acknowledges the need to maintain core functions and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by identifying “business disruptions,” including health epidemics, pandemics and natural disasters, as risks to its supply chain, distribution centers and retail operations, and by describing a suite of resilience measures to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning.  These measures include enhancing liquidity through a $6 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes, the temporary suspension of its share repurchase program and the establishment of an additional $2 billion committed credit facility; adjusting inventory management by modifying buying plans, cancelling pre-COVID factory purchases, shifting product offer dates and reallocating excess inventory to digital channels; maintaining business interruption insurance and disaster-recovery planning for key distribution and IT facilities; leveraging digital commerce—which remained open and grew 79 percent during widespread store closures—to sustain customer engagement; reopening over 90 percent of Nike Direct stores as public-health conditions permitted; investing in enterprise resource planning, robust information-technology systems and cybersecurity to mitigate interruptions, data-security breaches and operational failures; deploying foreign-exchange hedges and cash-flow hedging strategies to mitigate currency volatility; and reconfiguring its operating model, including transitioning certain wholesale markets to distributor partnerships, to reduce selling and administrative expenses, lessen exposure to external pressures and support sustainable, profitable growth.  Together, these strategies exemplify Nike’s dynamic capabilities to adapt resources and processes, manage risks, and maintain system integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

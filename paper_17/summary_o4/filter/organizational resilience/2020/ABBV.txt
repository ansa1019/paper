AbbVie’s Form 10-K disclosures emphasize its organizational resilience through detailed risk-management and continuity practices, noting that public health outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic “have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and financial condition,” which prompted the company to modify business practices, including instituting remote work, “closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines,” and monitor clinical trial sites to protect participants and staff.  The company acknowledges reliance on third-party service providers and single-source suppliers—“an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie’s business”—and mitigates such risks through business interruption insurance, credit facilities, contingency planning and ongoing risk assessment.  In response to the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an “integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization,” targeting more than $2 billion in annual cost synergies across R&D, selling, general and administrative functions and cost of products sold, supported by severance, retention and other integration expense provisions.  AbbVie further describes extensive regulatory, intellectual property and pricing pressures and the potential impact of IT security breaches, and details its investments in compliance, quality assurance, security protocols and legal defenses—measures that collectively strengthen operational flexibility, preserve organizational health under external disturbances and enable positive adjustment and continuity in the face of adversity.

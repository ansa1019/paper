The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 and the fear it has created has resulted in significant economic uncertainty, significant declines in business and consumer confidence and global demand, and has led to a global recession, and although we have not experienced a significant negative impact to our business or results of operations to date, we expect its impact will continue, at least in the near term, particularly through delayed, reduced or cancelled customer orders, supply-chain challenges from travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place and social distancing orders, and potential employee illness or government restrictions on critical workforce functions. In response, we have modified our workforce practices, such as having the vast majority of our employees working from home, and continue to evaluate alternate suppliers, employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models, and maintain long-term contracts and alternate sources to mitigate sole- or limited-source risks and preserve capacity for leading process technologies. We maintain a $4.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and manage our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with net cash provided by operating activities, to ensure liquidity and enable resource deployment for business continuity. We invest significant resources in research and development—particularly in 5G and adjacent product areas—to drive innovation, sustain competitive advantage and adapt our product portfolio to rapidly evolving technological and market conditions. Our enterprise risk management processes encompass supply-chain resilience, environmental, health and safety compliance, cybersecurity defenses, and legal and regulatory contingencies, including potential fines, litigation or government investigations, in order to absorb internal or external variations and disturbances, preserve organizational health, and maintain or improve functioning despite adversity. We pursue strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and minority investments, recognizing the integration challenges and the need for effective reconfiguration of operations, while monitoring metrics such as capacity utilization, accounts receivable and inventory levels and regularly reviewing purchase obligations, operating lease and debt maturities to support operational flexibility and performance maintenance under challenging conditions.

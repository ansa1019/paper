Bank of America describes a comprehensive suite of policies, procedures and strategic initiatives that collectively underpin its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, including pandemic-driven remote-work protocols, business continuity and contingency funding plans, stress testing and resolution planning tools. The corporation has implemented an enterprise response framework and global business continuity plans, with centralized incident management, backup systems, remote-access technology, digital-service platforms and employee training to maintain operations and customer services in the face of IT infrastructure failures, cyber events, government restrictions, illness and third-party disruptions. These measures are supported by liquidity and capital contingency plans, including a single-point-of-entry resolution strategy that entitles the parent and key subsidiaries to capital and liquidity transfers subject to pre-arranged intercompany arrangements, and by ongoing stress forecasting using multiple severely adverse macroeconomic scenarios to assess impacts on capital, liquidity and earnings. The firm also maintains contingency funding plans with escalation protocols, industry-and geography-specific concentration limits, and resolution authorities to deploy asset sales, debt issuances or portfolio de-risking strategies as needed. In addition, Bank of America evaluates operational resilience risks arising from system upgrades, integration projects, climate-driven natural disasters and evolving third-party dependencies, acknowledging that limited backup capacity, data processing delays and model uncertainties may impede its capacity to reconfigure operations, allocate resources and execute its strategic response under unexpected or extreme conditions.

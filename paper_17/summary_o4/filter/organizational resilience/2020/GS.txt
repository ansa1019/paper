Goldman Sachs describes an extensive operational resilience framework designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by codifying business continuity and contingency planning into its governance, processes and infrastructure.  The firm’s Business Continuity Plan, invoked in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, implements remote work protocols, strict physical distancing and enhanced facility controls, supported by robust information-security measures and third-party vendor oversight.  Liquidity risk is managed through pre-funding modeled 30-day and intraday stress outflows with a defined Global Core Liquidity Asset pool of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets and a diversified funding profile of secured and unsecured term financing, supplemented by a formal contingency funding plan and regular stress tests.  Capital resilience is assured through integrated capital planning and stress-testing processes—including the Federal Reserve’s CCAR and DFAST severely adverse scenarios and a resolution capital framework with loss-absorbing capacity requirements (TLAC, SCB, LCR, NSFR)—to ensure adequate buffers and loss recognition over multi-year horizons.  A firmwide Risk Governance Committee and an Operational Risk and Resilience Committee oversee credit, market, operational and model risks through a combination of limits, scenario analyses, sensitivity measures, credit reviews, collateral and netting arrangements and independent model validations.  These measures, taken together, enable the firm to absorb strain, preserve critical functions, reconstitute resources and adapt its operating model to sustain performance under both expected and exceptional disruptions.

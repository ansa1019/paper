Mastercard’s 2020 disclosures describe how the global COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures have challenged the company’s ability to maintain business continuity, noting that social distancing, travel restrictions and governmental mandates have adversely affected its workforce, operations and those of its customers, suppliers and partners, and have required it to modify employee travel policies, remote-work models and other business practices and to remain prepared to take further actions as circumstances evolve. The company reports maintaining an “enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies,” while acknowledging that temporary unavailability of its transaction switching systems, disruptions to service providers, third-party settlement failures and evolving cyber-threats could materially impair its ability to process transactions, damage its reputation and require additional resource investments to remediate system vulnerabilities and reinforce controls. Mastercard highlights its reliance on liquidity management—through cash flow generation, investment securities balances, access to a committed credit facility and guarantees of customer settlement obligations—to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse financial conditions, while noting that global credit market volatility, changes in tax laws, regulatory developments, geopolitical events and concentrated relationships with large customers may expose it to risk of loss or require reallocation of financial and operational resources. The company’s ongoing efforts to diversify and integrate new products and services across its multi-rail payments network, onboard non-traditional customers and adapt to rapid technological change underscore its focus on operational flexibility, risk mitigation, strategic initiative alignment and stakeholder engagement as mechanisms to sustain performance, recover from disruptions and maintain system integrity in a complex, dynamic environment.

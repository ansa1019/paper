Abbott’s disclosures describe a range of resilience‐related strategies and resources designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions: the company invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of cyber attack, monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment, and implements comprehensive business continuity plans under public health crises, including remote work, strict travel restrictions, rotational office staffing and enhanced facility safety measures. Abbott maintains operational flexibility in its manufacturing networks and supply chains by addressing equipment malfunctions, raw‐material issues, natural disasters and single‐supplier dependencies, and by reallocating resources to critical facilities as needed. It commits substantial funds and other resources to research and development despite the inherent risk of failure, recognizing that promising new products may fail at any point in the process yet must be pursued to sustain competitive advantage. Financial resilience is supported by strong cash flows that are expected to exceed capital expenditures and dividends, ample liquidity through undrawn credit facilities, hedging arrangements to mitigate foreign‐currency exposure, disciplined debt refinancing and share repurchase programs, and maintenance of investment‐grade credit ratings to preserve flexibility under changing economic conditions. Continuous regulatory compliance efforts, such as executing corrective actions to close an FDA warning letter, and strategic initiatives to expand diagnostic, medical devices, nutritionals and established pharmaceuticals portfolios reflect a systemic perspective that enables the organization to absorb strain, adapt to external pressures, reconfigure trajectories of response toward disruptive events and emerge stronger, as demonstrated by the rapid development and launch of multiple COVID-19 testing solutions to preserve or improve functioning during the pandemic.

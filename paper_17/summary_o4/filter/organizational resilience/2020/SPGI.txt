The companyâ€™s business continuity program has been effective to date, enabling nearly its entire employee population to work remotely since mid-March 2020 and preserving operations under pandemic-related travel bans, social distancing and shelter-in-place orders, although sustaining a remote work environment has required diverting IT resources from improvement and innovation projects and has increased vulnerability to cyber threats. We regularly assess and take steps to improve our business continuity plans and key management succession, yet acknowledge that a local or regional disaster, another pandemic, a cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other disruption could materially interrupt our operations, cause financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability and impede our ability to meet client needs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic we have actively analyzed evolving economic conditions, published research, taken rating actions, revised index compositions and adjusted business procedures, demonstrating adaptive strategies, risk assessment and resource reallocation in the face of extreme conditions. The merger integration process further underscores the need to reconfigure organizational practices, harmonize corporate and administrative infrastructures, align cultures and controls, and coordinate geographically separate organizations in order to realize synergies, cost savings, innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies under external pressures. Across all businesses, we have enhanced our cyber-security and privacy controls, information-management capabilities and compliance processes, reflecting a systemic perspective on risk mitigation, organizational resilience and the maintenance of performance and integrity in the face of uncertainty, disruptions and evolving regulatory demands.

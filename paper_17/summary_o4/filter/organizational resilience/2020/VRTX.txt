We rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers and clinical research organizations to sustain our supply chains and research activities, and we are developing additional manufacturing sources to mitigate potential disruptions. We have established a corporate compliance program and global privacy and data protection framework to identify, prevent and mitigate legal, regulatory and cybersecurity risks, and maintain insurance coverage to address environmental hazards and other extraordinary events. We have adopted a business continuity plan to address crises, including detailed procedures for data recovery and facility restoration in the event of catastrophic loss, and we have strengthened our information technology security measures to guard against service interruptions, data breaches and cyber-attacks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned the majority of our workforce to remote operations, implemented phased, site-specific access to research and manufacturing facilities, and re-initiated clinical trial enrollment and dosing with ongoing monitoring of local conditions, while recognizing that future site closures or pauses could affect our development timelines. Our integration of acquisitions and collaborations is managed through structured processes and contingency planning intended to realize anticipated benefits and maintain operational continuity. In addition, we maintain substantial cash reserves, employ foreign currency hedging and continually assess financing alternatives to ensure we can fund our research, development and commercialization efforts under varying economic and market conditions.

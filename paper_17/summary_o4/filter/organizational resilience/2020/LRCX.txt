The Company states that its ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences, and competencies is critical to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions and preserving organizational performance amidst intense competition for talent, fluctuations in industry and economic conditions, and increasing geographic expansion, which may lead to cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. It acknowledges that success in hiring relies on the attractiveness of its compensation and benefit programs, organizational structure, global economic, political and industry factors, competition for qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, obtaining necessary work authorizations, and offering a challenging and rewarding work environment. The Company further discloses that it periodically evaluates its compensation and benefit programs and makes appropriate adjustments to maintain or enhance their competitivenessâ€”a mechanism aimed at sustaining operational flexibility and human capital resilience. It warns that failure to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees could hinder its ability to capitalize on market opportunities and materially and adversely affect its operating results, thereby underscoring the strategic importance of these resource allocation and adaptability measures for organizational resilience.

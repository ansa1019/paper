In our Risk Factors we disclose that “our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the impact of the pandemic,” and we acknowledge that “natural disasters, pandemics, economic, political, regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities,” potentially leading to increased costs, loss of property or equipment and challenges in staffing and managing operations. We identify significant risks including “disruptions or delays in our manufacturing and supply chain, increased currency volatility, and delays in certain cost-saving, transformation and restructuring initiatives,” which may erode our operational flexibility and competitive position. While “we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place” and work with internal specialists and third-party service providers to protect systems and data, a failure or cybersecurity breach of these systems “could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs.” We further note that our “increased reliance on third-party resources to manufacture some of our products and product parts … diminish[s] our direct control” and may impair “the speed and flexibility in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences,” placing us at a competitive disadvantage. Our strategic imperatives include transforming our culture and ways of working, aligning our talent and organizational design with our increasingly complex business needs, innovating to a consumer-centric business, “promot[ing] brand equity successfully,” “develop[ing] new products and markets and broadening brand portfolios,” improving productivity, and ensuring adequate production capacity to meet demand. We also caution that actions to recover margins, such as pricing adjustments in response to adverse currency trends, “may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position,” and that restrictions on funds repatriation from subsidiaries due to local currency exchange controls could affect our financial flexibility and resource deployment under varying conditions.

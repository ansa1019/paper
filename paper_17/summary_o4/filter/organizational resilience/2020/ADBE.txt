The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers operate our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain; we have temporarily closed Adobe offices globally and implemented travel restrictions, and this global work-from-home operating environment has caused strain for, and may adversely impact the productivity of, certain employees, which may persist and harm our business, including our future operating results; our efforts to re-open our offices safely may not be successful, could expose our employees, customers and partners to health risks and us to associated liability, involve additional financial burdens and require adaptation of our operating model; if the pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees’, partners’ or customers’ businesses and productivity, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. We have shifted all of our in-person customer, employee and industry events through July 2021 to virtual-only experiences, and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel additional events in the future; our virtual events may not be as successful as in-person events, which could adversely affect our business continuity and customer engagement. Authorities throughout the world have implemented measures to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus—physical distancing, travel bans, closure of non-essential businesses, quarantines, work-from-home directives and shelter-in-place orders—which have caused business slowdowns or shutdowns regionally and worldwide, impacting our operations and potentially delaying the provisioning of our offerings; if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed. We rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, and any interruptions, delays, transitions among data centers or to third-party hosted environments that encounter unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions despite precautions may impair our delivery of products and services, result in increased costs and liabilities and harm our business and reputation. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one data center, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities; any major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event not adequately addressed by our plans could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, breaches of data security, loss of critical data and delays in product development, and could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders or decrease regional demand for our products. If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with customer needs and experience rapid and significant demand on capacity, service outages could occur, subjecting us to regulatory and customer notification requirements, violations of service level commitments, financial liabilities and customer dissatisfaction. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and impacts on critical infrastructure in California, Utah, India and other regions, have the potential to disrupt our business, third-party suppliers and our customers’ operations, and may cause higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations; to assess and take proactive action, we align with the Financial Stability Board’s TCFD recommendations and the SASB environmental metrics. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through more secure engineering, enhanced security and reliability features, code hardening, rigorous penetration tests, deployment of updates, review of service providers’ controls, auditing against frameworks such as ISO 27001, SOC 2 and PCI, and improving incident response time, but these vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated; despite our preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims, causing customers to stop using or delay purchases of our offerings. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments; changes in global tax laws or interpretations could adversely affect our effective tax rates, cash flows and require changes to our business structure. As a result of intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights completed during fiscal 2020, we recognized significant deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits, although the geographic mix of international income may adversely affect future effective rates. Based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, anticipated cash flows from operations and our $1 billion revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months; we expect capital investment of approximately $550 million to $650 million through fiscal 2022 to fund San Jose and Bangalore construction projects. To return value to stockholders and minimize dilution, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements when the expected discount justifies the foregone return on cash prepayments, and we remain authorized to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock through the end of fiscal 2024.

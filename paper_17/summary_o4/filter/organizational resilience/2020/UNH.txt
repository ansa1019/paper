During the COVID-19 pandemic, we mobilized the full strength of our resources to deliver the best care for patients, support members and care provider partners, keep our employees safe and deliver innovative solutions and support for the communities we serve and the entire health system. These actions required us to intensify medical and operating cost management, adjust members’ benefits and premiums, and make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks to offset funding pressures such as the return of the health insurance industry tax and downward rate pressures in government programs. Through our risk-based benefit products we assume both medical and administrative cost risk, generally using approximately 80% to 85% of premium revenues to pay health care costs, and we manage these costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Our ability to implement new and innovative services, price our products adequately, provide effective service in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and report accurate results depends on the integrity and availability of our data and information systems, which require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, enhance and develop new systems to keep pace with changes in information processing technology, evolving regulatory standards and customer preferences. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our systems’ capabilities and have programs to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and to provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks, recognizing that failures in our information systems or inaccuracies in our data could lead to operational disruptions, loss of customers, regulatory sanctions, increased costs and other adverse consequences. We work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to close gaps in care and improve outcomes, serving nearly 18 million people through aligned arrangements—including full-risk, shared-risk, bundled-episode-of-care and performance incentive payment models—and we expanded coverage for COVID-19 care and testing, telemedicine and pharmacy benefits, provided co-pay waivers, premium forgiveness and extended payment terms, simplified administrative practices and accelerated payments to care providers to assist our customers, members and communities in confronting this unprecedented disruption. In parallel, we apply actuarial estimates such as completion factors and per-member-per-month trend factors to project medical costs payable and reserve development, adjusting those estimates for the pandemic’s impacts, while continuing to seek targeted product, network and membership changes to preserve performance and reinforce our ability to absorb strain and maintain integrity and functionality under challenging conditions.

While protecting the health of our associates, we secured our supply chain; ensured continuity in manufacturing, distribution and sales; further strengthened our e-commerce and digital capabilities; reimagined our marketing; delivered positive outcomes for people, our shareholders and the planet, and developed and implemented health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business. We recognize that failure to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including through investments in data analytics, can erode our competitive position, and we continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives to simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems; and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint to position our business for long-term sustainable growth. Our integrated risk management framework, led by the Pepsico Risk Committee and supported by division and country risk committees, board oversight and a dedicated risk management office, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to identify, assess, prioritize and address strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. We devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other security measures to protect our information systems and data, fully aware that system shutdowns, degraded performance, disruptions or cyber incidents can adversely affect our ability to manage operations. In addition, we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans, expand shared services into new capabilities and migrate systems to enterprise-wide solutions, all designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external variations and disturbances.

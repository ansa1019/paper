Accenture’s 2020 Form 10-K Risk Factors disclosure highlights that its substantial size and scale—approximately 506,000 employees worldwide as of August 31, 2020—creates significant management and organizational challenges that could impair its ability to maintain effective standards across the enterprise, institutionalize internal knowledge, preserve its culture, manage and monitor personnel and operations, and communicate core values, policies, procedures, strategies and goals globally, thereby potentially hindering its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under pressure. The company underscores the critical need to develop and implement appropriate processes and tools to manage the enterprise, instill its culture and core values in all employees, and mitigate risks of unlawful or fraudulent activity, breaches of confidentiality and reputational damage. It further explains that the transition to a new growth model organized by three geographic markets in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was designed to better serve clients and scale the business, but that unsuccessful implementation of such structural changes could negatively affect business continuity, operational flexibility and firm performance. Finally, Accenture identifies risks associated with integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures, which may disrupt ongoing operations, divert management attention, require additional resources, challenge organizational structure and talent retention, and incur significant costs—including those for retention payments, enhanced controls, procedures and policies related to financial reporting, disclosure and cyber and information security—that could adversely impact its resource allocation, strategic response capabilities and overall resilience.

In response to the global spread of the coronavirus and associated volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, we altered aspects of our operations in response to government mandates, health care advisories and employee and vendor concerns, including transitioning a significant portion of our workforce to work-from-home arrangements, severely curtailing international travel, and resuming productions in many regions while acknowledging that our ability to produce content remains affected by the pandemic and may continue to be disrupted by supply constraints, cost increases or delays. We actively monitor the evolving public health crisis and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as required by authorities or deemed in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders, though it is not clear what impact such measures may have on our customers, suppliers, vendors or financial results. We continue to manage the complexity of scaling our streaming service and original content production internationally by leveraging third-party cloud computing services, building our own global content delivery network, developing expertise across creative, marketing, legal, finance and technical disciplines, and refining our systems and operational practices to address varied content offerings, consumer customs, e-commerce and regulatory environments. We rely upon a network of partners to make our service available on multiple devices and through integrated billing arrangements, and assess risks related to payment processing, cybersecurity, potential unauthorized access to our systems, and outages of third-party infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services. To maintain operational flexibility and business continuity, we actively manage liquidity through cash flows from operations, debt facilities and free cash flow generation, while recognizing that our long-term and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments may limit our ability to adjust spending rapidly in response to changes in membership acquisition, retention, or content performance. We regularly assess risks to our reputation, intellectual property, regulatory compliance and capital markets access, and align our strategic initiatives, investments and resource allocation to preserve performance and system integrity under both nominal and extreme conditions.

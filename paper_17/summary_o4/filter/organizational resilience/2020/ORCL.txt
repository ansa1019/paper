We acknowledge that we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which we cannot control or predict, and that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected how we and our customers operate our respective businesses, leading us to conduct business as usual with modifications to employee travel, work locations and marketing events, to actively monitor the situation and to take further actions as may be required by authorities or deemed in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders; we further recognize that if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed. Our success depends on our ability to develop new products and services, integrate and enhance acquired offerings and refresh and release new cloud products and services in the face of rapid technological advances, intense competition, changing delivery models and evolving customer needs, and we employ strategies to ensure continuity—such as outsourcing manufacturing to reduce supply chain risk, exploring additional third-party partners to drive supply chain continuity, and using foreign currency forward contracts to offset exchange-rate volatility—while investing in security measures to protect the integrity of our products and data against third-party exploits. We continuously monitor compliance with evolving international and U.S. laws and regulations, including privacy, environmental and trade requirements, and we investigate operational improprieties to preserve operational flexibility, maintain performance under internal and external pressures and uphold business continuity despite disruptions.

In response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (covid-19 pandemic), we have taken and are taking actions to maintain continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including raising $4.1 billion in debt, negotiating amendments to our revolving credit facility to ensure minimum liquidity, significantly reducing marketing spend and capital expenditures, implementing a company-wide hiring freeze and participating in government wage subsidy programs, as well as undertaking restructuring activities across all brands to reduce workforce size, consolidate operations and optimize efficiency—measures expected to yield approximately $370 million in annualized personnel cost savings—while preserving resources for critical operational continuity and technological investments. We have curtailed non-essential business travel, canceled internal events and other discretionary operating costs, continually monitor liquidity and credit rating metrics and believe existing cash balances and liquid resources will fund our operating activities, capital expenditures and other obligations through at least the next twelve months. Our ongoing initiatives include working with travel service providers and customers on cancellations and force majeure provisions, increasing provisions for expected credit losses to manage credit risk, evolving payment processing capabilities to enable flexible transaction terms, enhancing cybersecurity defenses against increasingly sophisticated attacks, adjusting marketing strategies based on return on investment and projected sequencing of travel demand recovery, and offering more flexible cancellation policies and rebate programs—all of which serve to absorb strain, preserve functioning and position the company to emerge stronger from extended adversity.

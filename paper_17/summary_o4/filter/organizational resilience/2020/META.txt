Throughout the report, the Company describes its ongoing efforts to maintain operations and adapt under challenging conditions, including the significant disruptions and business slowdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and related preventative measures, which have required accelerated scaling of technical infrastructure—data centers, network capacity, computing power—and rapid adjustments to service delivery to preserve system integrity and performance despite surges in demand.  The Company highlights its investments in privacy, safety, security, and content‐review initiatives as organizational capabilities intended to mitigate risks and preserve user trust, alongside continued expansion of capacity and diversification of marketing and sales resources to support business continuity.  It acknowledges the risk of interruptions from natural disasters, physical security threats, cyber-attacks, and regulatory changes—any of which could degrade user experience or impair the delivery of ads—and describes proactive strategies such as expanding renewable energy agreements, investing in disaster‐resilient facilities, and securing third-party vendor relationships to reconfigure resources and support continuity.  The report further details strategic agility in product and investment decisions—prioritizing long-term user engagement over short-term revenue—to reconstitute trajectories of response to disruptive events, including remote‐work enablement and reallocation of personnel to critical functions, and emphasizes ongoing risk assessments of regulatory, competitive, and technological pressures, together with continuous refinement of monitoring metrics, to reinforce the organization’s ability to absorb strain, implement crisis response measures, and maintain positive adjustment under extreme or exceptional conditions.

Our disclosures reflect that we routinely face a broad range of internal and external disturbances—ranging from competitive pressures, supply-chain and technology disruptions, cybersecurity incidents and regulatory changes to the extreme economic instability and uncertainty engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic—and have therefore invested in an integrated suite of resilience strategies and mechanisms designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve organizational functioning under adverse conditions.  These measures include business continuity planning and disaster recovery protocols to maintain system integrity and operational flexibility, the rapid reconfiguration of work arrangements (for example, a near-complete shift to remote operations and enhanced videoconferencing security controls), the development and deployment of cloud-based infrastructure with redundancy and high-availability capabilities, third-party risk assessment and inter-organizational collaboration to ensure uninterrupted critical service delivery, ongoing upgrades to internal information-technology systems to support peak seasonal demand and adapt to regulatory or tax-filing deadline changes, and the strengthening of fraud prevention, cybersecurity and data-protection controls in partnership with government agencies and industry peers.  We also recognize the need for dynamic capabilities in our strategic planning and M&A activities—such as integration of acquired technology and talent, resource reallocation, retention of key employees and the alignment of internal control environments—to manage organizational change processes, mitigate unexpected execution risks, and sustain competitive advantage.  By continuously calibrating these resources, processes and relationships, we seek to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, protect our reputation and stakeholder confidence, and position the company to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

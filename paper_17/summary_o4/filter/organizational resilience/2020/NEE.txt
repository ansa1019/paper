NEE and FPL maintain comprehensive risk management and continuity frameworks to ensure operational flexibility and positive adjustment under internal and external pressures, including extensive regulation, environmental statutes, permit requirements, natural disasters, cyberattacks and supply-chain volatility. They deploy regulatory-driven cost recovery mechanisms, storm reserve funds, securitized storm-recovery bonds, reserve amortization under rate agreements and decommissioning trusts to allocate resources, mitigate hazards and preserve service reliability. Through the use of energy derivative hedges, master netting agreements, credit support facilities and diversified capital sources, they absorb market volatility, manage cash flows, sustain liquidity and hedge against commodity, interest-rate and counterparty credit risks. Their project development and operational processes integrate licensing, permitting, contractual risk allocation, contingency planning and financial structuring to adapt to schedule changes, cost overruns, third-party disputes and complex interdependencies in generation, transmission and gas infrastructure. In the event of extreme weather, cyber-related incidents or other disruptions, predefined emergency management protocols, insurance programs and cost recovery surcharges enable the companies to restore service and recover restoration costs, thereby maintaining continuity under challenging conditions. Governance by exposure management committees, compliance with mandatory reliability standards and proactive adjustments to capital and compliance strategies reflect a systemic perspective in reconfiguring organizational trajectories, sustaining integrity, performance and emerging stronger from adversity. This multifaceted approach to strategic resource deployment, dynamic capital management and stakeholder engagement supports business continuity and fosters long-term organizational resilience.

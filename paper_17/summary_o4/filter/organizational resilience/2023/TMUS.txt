The company discloses that its procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information and to defend against cyberattacks seeking to disrupt operations “must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever-evolving threat landscape and changing cybersecurity regulations,” requiring the investment of significant resources and management time and attention, yet it “cannot provide any assurances that actions taken by us, or our third-party providers, will adequately repel a significant cyberattack or substantially mitigate the impacts of cybersecurity breaches or misuses of confidential information,” highlighting its ongoing focus on business continuity and operational flexibility under internal or external variations. It further acknowledges that system failures and business disruptions resulting from severe weather, storms, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, wildfires and natural disasters—“which may occur more frequently or with greater intensity as a result of global climate change”—public health crises, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility and acts of war “may prevent us from providing reliable service,” cause loss of customers and revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject the company to fines, litigation or governmental investigations, thereby underscoring its need for emergency management and recovery capabilities. To remain competitive, the company “will need to adapt to changes in available technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing service offerings, and introduce new offerings to meet our current and potential customers’ changing service demands,” reflecting resource reconfiguration, service innovation and adaptation strategies. In modernizing its applications and systems, the company notes that “any delays or failures in these initiatives could impact our ability to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, ensure reliable system performance and effective cybersecurity, recover promptly from system outages, and maintain satisfactory customer and employee experiences,” illustrating its commitment to systemic performance maintenance under complex conditions. In connection with regulatory approvals, the company agreed to “extensive 5G network build-out commitments, obligations to deliver high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans and marketing our in-home fixed wireless product to households where spectrum capacity is sufficient,” and warns that “any failure to fulfill our obligations under these government commitments in a timely manner could result in substantial fines, penalties, or other legal and administrative actions and/or reputational harm,” signaling the importance of strategic initiative management under external pressures. The company’s reliance on third parties for products and services—where “a limited number of suppliers who can provide adequate support” exist—exposes it to risks including disruptions in global supply chains, natural catastrophic events and supplier non-performance, which “could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations,” demonstrating the need for supply chain resilience and risk mitigation mechanisms. It also recognizes that it “does not have control of the cybersecurity systems, breach prevention, and response protocols of our third-party providers” even as it “may have contractual rights to assess the effectiveness of many of our providers’ systems and protocols,” highlighting collaborative monitoring and inter-organizational collaboration under uncertainty. The company expects to continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattack methods—“including in the use of tools and techniques (such as artificial intelligence) that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls, evade detection, and obfuscate forensic evidence, making it more challenging for us to identify, investigate and recover from future cyberattacks in a timely and effective manner”—and warns that “if we fail to protect confidential information or to prevent operational disruptions from future cyberattacks, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and operating results,” thereby reinforcing its orientation toward maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

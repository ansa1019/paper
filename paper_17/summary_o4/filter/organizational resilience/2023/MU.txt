The company has taken significant steps to reduce its costs and operating expenses, including the 2023 restructure plan in response to challenging industry conditions and additional reductions in external spending, such as implementing productivity programs across the business, suspending its 2023 bonus company-wide, reducing select product programs, lowering discretionary spending, and cutting 2023 executive salaries, and under this plan expects its headcount reduction to approach 15% by the end of calendar 2023 through voluntary attrition and personnel reductions, which it anticipates will yield cost savings of approximately $130 million per quarter; ongoing demand growth, customer inventory normalization, and industry-wide supply discipline have set the stage for increased revenue, improved pricing, and profitability throughout fiscal 2024 so that pricing trends have begun to improve and there were no inventory write-downs to net realizable value in the fourth quarter of 2023; in response to the CAC decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase its products, the company is working to mitigate possible impacts through lower-price or altered customer mix strategies while preserving long-term market share goals; it expects wafer starts to remain significantly below peak capacity levels as it focuses on managing down inventories and controlling supply; it continuously evaluates alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations, including engaging in financing transactions and investing in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, research and development, and process technology to support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality; its operations depend on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and on third-party suppliers and service providers, only some of which are single or sole sources, and it actively manages supply chain constraints that could limit bit shipments; it manufactures products using highly complex processes requiring technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance, while addressing risks of reduced yields, production disruptions, and increased per-gigabit costs from process complexity or shifting product mix; its global network of manufacturing and other facilities is subject to natural occurrences, climate-related events, power outages, and geopolitical and trade risks, for which it maintains contingency measures including insurance that may be subject to higher premiums and diversification across jurisdictions to mitigate potential increases in costs, production disruptions, or damage to customer relationships; it pursues strategic capacity expansions, acquisitions, and alliances, weighing risks such as integration, synergy realization, funding availability, government incentives, workforce constraints, and customer demand; it focuses on attracting, retaining, and motivating highly skilled, diverse employees and on managing succession for key roles; it has adopted responsible sourcing and environmental, social, and governance criteria to manage stakeholder expectations, supply chain integrity, and reputation; and it manages financial resilience through liquidity from cash, investments, available credit facilities, share repurchase authorizations up to $10 billion subject to market conditions, and a discretionary quarterly dividend policy, anticipating these resources will be sufficient to meet its requirements at least through the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.

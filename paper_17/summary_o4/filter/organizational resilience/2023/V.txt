Visa maintains a comprehensive resilience framework that encompasses compliance programs and policies which are continually adjusted to meet evolving global regulations, settlement‐risk policies that require clients to post collateral for unsettled transactions, and a formal business continuity program designed to recover critical functions, assets, and data following cyber-attacks, natural disasters, or other operational disruptions. The company actively manages liquidity and strain absorption through cash, cash equivalents, and diversified debt securities, backed by an unsecured revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program to support working capital under adverse conditions. Cybersecurity resilience is reinforced by layered controls against sophisticated threats—including ransomware, advanced persistent attacks, insider threats, and vulnerabilities in third-party suppliers—and a global incident-reporting and response mechanism. Under its U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, Visa maintains a litigation escrow account to fund covered legal liabilities, thereby shielding operations and shareholders from direct impact. Incentive arrangements with financial institution clients and merchants are systematically recognized based on projected performance and actual outcomes, aligning resource deployment with volume growth while preserving financial flexibility. Proactive capital management through share repurchase and dividend programs further fortifies balance‐sheet strength. In pursuing acquisitions, joint ventures, and technology integrations, Visa applies rigorous due diligence, integration controls, and targeted retention incentives to ensure seamless adaptation and to preserve or improve organizational functioning despite disruptive change.

The 2023 Annual Report acknowledges that the Company’s growth and operations are subject to general economic conditions and related uncertainties, warning that “if the global economy and financial markets … continue to be unstable, they could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition,” and outlines strategic measures—market diversification, allocation of research and development funding to high-growth products, expansion of service offerings and enhanced commercial infrastructure—to maintain functioning amid external pressures. The risk factors section highlights supply chain fragilities, citing “interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers,” the impact of “public health emergencies, pandemics, epidemics or other health outbreaks,” and the potential for natural disasters—“an earthquake or other natural disaster … could disrupt our operations … or impair our critical systems”—to cause production interruptions, underlining business continuity planning and facility resilience. To address technological risks, the Company employs “a risk-based approach to implementing security controls, reviewing the security controls of certain key business partners and third-party service providers and conducting due diligence on companies we propose to acquire,” leverages data backups and acknowledges that “disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality,” demonstrating its commitment to system resilience under cyber and IT disruptions. The report also details operational flexibility through its Practical Process Improvement business system, low-cost region manufacturing and “headcount reductions and facility consolidations” designed to streamline operations, limit the impact of expected lower revenue and realize annual cost savings of $0.5 billion from $0.2 billion of charges, reflecting internal adjustments to preserve performance. Financial resilience is underscored by the assertion that “its existing cash and cash equivalents and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future,” indicating proactive liquidity management. Collectively, these actions—spanning strategic growth investments, productivity improvements, restructuring initiatives and risk-based security and continuity planning—illustrate a formal, technical approach to absorbing strain, preserving integrity and maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

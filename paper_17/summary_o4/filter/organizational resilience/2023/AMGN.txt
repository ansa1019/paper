In our risk disclosures we emphasize that our continued operations depend on sophisticated information technology systems and network-connected control systems, including those managed by third parties, and that internal or external events compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those systems could interrupt business operations and affect our reputation, particularly given our increased reliance on remote and hybrid work arrangements that heighten cybersecurity risks and vulnerability to software errors, cyberattacks and third-party data breaches. We recognize that our manufacturing concentration in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and in Thousand Oaks, California is subject to natural disasters—hurricanes, earthquakes, utility failures—and labor disputes and pandemic restrictions, all of which have necessitated reliance on backup generators and contingency plans to maintain production and clinical supplies. Our global supply chain is further exposed to single-source suppliers, raw-material shortages, geopolitical conflicts, climate-related disruptions and evolving regulatory requirements, and significant failures at our facilities or those of contract manufacturers could impair product supply, clinical trials and business continuity. We detail extensive financing arrangements, hedging strategies for foreign-currency and interest-rate exposures and credit facilities designed to meet liquidity requirements in volatile capital markets, while noting that credit-rating downgrades or adverse market conditions could impede access to capital. We describe the complexity and interconnected nature of our manufacturing, distribution and supplier networks, necessitating ongoing adjustments to demand forecasts and production plans. We disclose the inherent risks in our collaboration and acquisition activities, including the challenges of integrating new operations, technology and personnel without unanticipated costs or delays, and the need to maintain operational continuity throughout combinations. Additionally, we outline our systematic approach to monitoring and accruing for rebates, chargebacks and product returns, our commitment to compliance with evolving privacy, data-protection and tax laws, and the continuous assessment of market, regulatory and macroeconomic pressures—including health emergencies—to allocate resources and adapt strategically, thereby preserving our ability to maintain functioning and performance under challenging conditions.

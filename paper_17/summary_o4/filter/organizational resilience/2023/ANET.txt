The company acknowledges that “earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, health epidemics and other catastrophic events could harm our business” and cautions that “business disruptions and supply chain and manufacturing disruptions may result in customers delaying or canceling or reprioritizing capital expenditures on information technology and network infrastructure,” noting that “insufficient component supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.” It further observes that “due to the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior, our quarterly revenue and results of operations have fluctuated from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate” and concedes that “our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period and can be unpredictable.” To support continuity, the company states that “we regularly maintain cash balances that are not insured or are in excess of the FDIC’s insurance limit,” and warns that “any delay in our ability to access our cash, cash equivalents and investments (or the loss of such funds) or to timely pay key vendors and others could have a material adverse effect on our operations.” The firm explains that “we have entered into significant purchase commitments to support long-term customer demand” but that it “remains susceptible to supply shortages, extended lead times or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries,” and concedes that reliance on “third-party contract manufacturers to build our products” leaves it “susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping end-customer orders on time.” It also warns that “adverse economic conditions, continuing uncertain economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business” and that “we believe that any extended or renewed economic disruptions or deterioration in the global economy could have an adverse impact to our liquidity or to our current and projected business operations.”

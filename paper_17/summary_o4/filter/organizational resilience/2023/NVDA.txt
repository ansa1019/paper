Our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities and our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, acts of war or terrorism, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration and other catastrophic events. Product, system security and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations, reduce revenue and harm our reputation, requiring us to continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features and to rely on third-party suppliers while accepting risks of supply chain attacks and business disruptions. In response to changing export controls, we transitioned certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out of China and Hong Kong and are working to expand our product portfolio to include solutions for which no advance license is required. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand, enter long-term supply and capacity commitments, pay premiums and deposits to secure future supply, and continuously manage product availability, costs and channel inventory across shifting product transitions, competitor actions and macroeconomic conditions. We believe we maintain sufficient liquidity to support our operating requirements, future supply obligations, debt repayments and capital investments, and we continuously evaluate liquidity and capital resources, including access to external capital, commercial paper and share repurchase flexibility, to support ongoing operations and strategic initiatives. We rely on internal processes and scalable information systems to support key business functions and on insurance coverage, although policy limits and exclusions may leave gaps. In the event of a disaster, military conflict or other major event affecting us, our supply chain or our customers, we may incur declines in revenue, increases in expenses and substantial expenditures and time to resume operations. We also face challenges integrating acquisitions and strategic investments, including systems integration, talent retention and realizing anticipated benefits, which require resource reconfiguration and adaptation to maintain performance. This multifaceted set of operational adjustments, resource allocations, strategic transitions and risk mitigation measures reflects our ongoing efforts to preserve or improve functioning under challenging internal and external conditions.

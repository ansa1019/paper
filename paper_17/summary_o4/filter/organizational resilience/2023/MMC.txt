The company’s disclosures emphasize the centrality of business continuity and disaster recovery in maintaining operations under adverse conditions, noting that “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability” and that, in such events—ranging from “earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, war or other geopolitical tensions, protests or riots, security breach, cyberattack…, power loss or telecommunications failure”—its ability to operate depends on “the continued availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations,” while acknowledging that “our business disruption insurance may also not fully cover… the cost of a successful recovery.”  It asserts that “our information systems must be continually updated, patched, and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities” and that the “inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect,” even as it “regularly assesses and takes steps to improve our existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession.”  The firm highlights the risks posed by its reliance on “a large number of vendors and other third parties… to perform key functions,” recognizing that any failure by these parties could “disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in… harm to our business,” and stresses the need for robust cybersecurity measures in the face of “unauthorized access, damage or interruption from… external threats.”  Financial resilience is pursued through currency‐risk management—issuing €1.1 billion of senior notes “designated as a net investment hedge” and re-assessing effectiveness quarterly—and through agile resource allocation informed by non-GAAP revenue metrics, which management uses “to assess operating performance… and to decide how to allocate resources.”  The company acknowledges that “geopolitical or macroeconomic conditions… have the potential to materially adversely affect” its results, and it has undertaken “strategic initiatives involving investments in or partnerships with technology companies… and infrastructure to support our own systems” to enhance adaptability to digital disruption.  Its ongoing integration of acquisitions and focus on “key management succession” and “maintaining our corporate culture, particularly in a hybrid work environment,” reflect a systemic, multifaceted approach to preserving organizational health, sustaining performance under pressure, and maintaining “positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

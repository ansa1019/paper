Our risk disclosures highlight that our product supply and related patient access has been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted by difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products—including plant seizures, vendor or supplier non-compliance with cGMP regulations, quality control or supply problems, construction or approval delays for new or expanded facilities, failure to meet emerging tracking regulations, limits to manufacturing capacity, labor disputes, other business interruptions and disruptions from market forces, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other unforeseeable events that materially impact one or more of our facilities or a critical supplier; our ability to source raw materials and supplies and to develop consistent and reliable manufacturing processes and distribution networks at attractive cost of goods could affect anticipated revenue and gross profit for novel cell-based therapies, and logistical or shipment delays beyond our control could prevent or delay delivery of our product candidates and marketed products to patients; we rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—some managed or hosted by third parties—and face risk of cyberattacks, intrusions, malware, ransomware, phishing and other incidents that could disrupt our business, steal proprietary or confidential information and adversely affect our strategy, operations or financial condition despite our ongoing efforts and those of our third-party vendors to maintain system security and integrity; we depend on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to support research, development, manufacturing, commercialization, co-promotion and business unit services, and the failure of any critical third party to meet contractual, regulatory or other obligations, including deploying business continuity plans in the event of a crisis or resolving significant disagreements with us, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results; under the terms of a consent order with the SEC we have established a company-wide policy supported by governance processes—including formal review and certification of our filings, a business risk and disclosure group, external consulting, bottom-up budget inputs, disclosures of sales incentives and escalation mechanisms—to monitor and limit sales to direct customers and ensure timely resolution of potential compliance issues; and we regularly assess our working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, share repurchase plans and future investments or acquisitions, together with available cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, commercial paper and revolving credit and term loan facilities, to manage financial risks, maintain adequate liquidity, lower cost of capital and preserve flexibility to support ongoing operations and strategic initiatives.

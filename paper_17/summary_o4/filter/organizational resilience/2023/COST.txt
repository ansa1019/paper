The Company’s disclosures emphasize its capacity to maintain operations and performance under adverse conditions, reflecting organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.” Risk factors describe dependencies on the orderly operation of merchandise receiving and distribution processes, processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities, and the criticality of information technology systems for transaction processing, inventory tracking, reporting and member services. The report details potential disruptions from fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics, extreme weather conditions, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, security breaches and other catastrophic events that may delay production and delivery, impair business continuity and require significant investments to restore services.

Supply chain resilience is addressed through forward deployment of inventory, diversification of suppliers and investments in supply-chain efficiency.

The Company’s strategic initiatives—inventory and resource deployment, pricing and merchandise mix adjustments, membership growth strategies, acquisitions, lease and construction planning, and cost control measures—are designed to adapt to economic fluctuations, competitive pressures, tariff impacts, labor and healthcare cost trends, consumer preferences and evolving environmental regulations.

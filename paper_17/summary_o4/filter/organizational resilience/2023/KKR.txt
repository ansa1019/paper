In the KKR 10-K the firm describes its efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions through risk mitigation strategies and business continuity planning, acknowledging that, “while we may attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent practicable and reasonable, …we make no representation that our mitigation efforts…will be successful.” It highlights enterprise-wide disaster recovery and business continuation programs designed to manage operational disruptions, including those from cyber-security failures, natural disasters, pandemics or geopolitical events, though it cautions that such programs “may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm” of future crises. The firm further describes its robust liquidity management framework as a key resilience mechanism, supporting asset management and insurance operations through diverse funding sources such as capital commitments, debt facilities and insurance liabilities, and discloses concentration and collateral requirements that could stress liquidity under adverse market conditions. KKR also emphasizes its risk management practices, including hedging of market risk benefits, maintenance of committed credit lines, diversification of investment strategies and quarterly reviews of actuarial assumptions to manage its insurance segment’s financial exposures. Governance structures, such as independent valuation and risk committees, are cited as systemic tools for monitoring and reconfiguring assumptions “under internal or external variations and disturbances,” thus supporting continuity of core operations and preparedness for unexpected stress. These disclosures collectively reflect KKR’s multifaceted approach to preserve functioning and sustain performance despite internal and external pressures.

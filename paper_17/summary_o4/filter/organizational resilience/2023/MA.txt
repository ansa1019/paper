Mastercard’s Form 10-K highlights “information security and operational resilience” as a key risk area, observing that incidents such as cyber-attacks, software or hardware failures, malicious code, or social-engineering exploits could lead to unauthorized disclosure or loss of critical information, service interruptions or other failures in the physical infrastructure, networks or operations systems, and materially damage its reputation, increase costs and impair transaction volumes. The company further acknowledges that service disruptions arising from technology malfunctions, supply-chain attacks, natural disasters, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events could prevent it from processing transactions or servicing customers, reduce its operational resilience and materially affect its overall business and results of operations. In response, Mastercard maintains “an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies,” though it concedes it cannot ensure immunity given the intrinsic importance of its transaction switching systems. Similarly, it identifies “operational difficulties, such as the temporary unavailability of our services or products, or information security breaches on our real-time account-based payments network” and the “operational and onboarding challenges” of deploying complex multi-rail solutions with new customers as factors that may trigger increased compliance burdens, performance problems or reputational harm, any of which could test its ability to adapt, recover and maintain business continuity under adverse conditions.

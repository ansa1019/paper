Our filings disclose that “our business, financial condition and results of operations are and will remain subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,” encompassing changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conflicts, natural and man-made disasters, and cybersecurity incidents that may result in material disruptions to our business and necessitate adjustments to preserve operational continuity and service levels. We rely on information technology networks and other operational technologies that “have been and will continue in the future to be susceptible to damage, disruptions and shutdowns” and accordingly have “invested and expect to continue to invest in IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery capabilities.” We recognize that workforce disruptions, including actual or threatened strikes, may adversely affect our ability to provide uninterrupted service, and we maintain strategic initiatives—such as “fit to serve” headcount reductions, productivity programs, digital access expansion, and smart facility technology deployment—to enhance responsiveness to changing market dynamics and to “right-size our business for the future.” Our approach to fuel price and currency volatility incorporates hedging transactions and weekly surcharge adjustments intended to mitigate the impact of environmental perturbations. We conduct ongoing reviews of our asset base, engaging in impairment testing and residual value adjustments for aircraft, goodwill and intangible assets under both income and market valuation approaches, to ensure our carrying values align with forecasted cash flows and market comparables. Self-insurance reserves are established using actuarial estimates that reflect actual loss experience and projected trends, and defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans are remeasured to capture changes in discount rates, expected returns, and participant demographics, thereby supporting the preservation of financial integrity in nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. These disclosures reflect an integrated perspective on risk mitigation, resource allocation, adaptability and transformation to maintain performance and resilience under pressure.

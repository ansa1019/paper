We discuss expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes and acknowledge that forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, requiring robust business continuity planning and risk-mitigation strategies to maintain operations under challenging conditions. We identify significant factors that may adversely affect our business, including the need to manage disruptions in credit markets or to our banking partners, maintain access to liquidity and navigate macroeconomic volatility such as foreign currency fluctuations, inflationary pressures and trade-policy changes. Our ability to meet customer needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain—labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, natural disasters, extreme weather events, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or pandemics, cybersecurity incidents and other external factors—and to execute supply-chain optimizations, sole-supplier arrangements, extended payment terms and supply-chain financing to strengthen operational flexibility and continuity. We rely extensively on information and operational technology systems, networks, physical security measures and third-party service-continuity plans to protect the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and critical business operations. We describe specific measures to address disease outbreaks, including managing fluctuations in consumer demand, temporary facility closures and employee travel restrictions, and contingency planning for governmental mandates that could limit or close operations. In response to the war between Russia and Ukraine, we reduced our product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments, suspended marketing activity, assessed potential physical damage to manufacturing and distribution facilities, and reconfigured our operations toward an evolving future trajectory. Our strategic focus includes developing next-level supply-chain capabilities to enable agility, resilience and productivity, delivering ongoing productivity improvements to fund superior innovation and reinvestment, and executing organizational change processes—leadership succession planning, talent retention and remote-work readiness—to preserve performance, absorb strain and adapt to evolving market dynamics. We maintain diversified funding sources, including global credit facilities, commercial paper programs and proactive cash-repatriation planning, and manage compliance with expanding laws and regulations, tax policy changes and multi-jurisdictional audit risks to safeguard organizational health under internal and external disturbances.

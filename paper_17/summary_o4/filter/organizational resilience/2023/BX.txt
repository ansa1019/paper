In the face of difficult market and economic conditions, the Company may need to reduce fixed costs and other expenses in order to maintain profitability and preserve operating continuity, recognizing that a failure to manage or reduce costs within a timeframe sufficient to match decreases in profitability would impair operating performance. The Company continuously monitors and adjusts its operational flexibility in response to volatility in financial markets, inflation, interest-rate shifts and geopolitical events that can materially affect asset valuations and cash flows, and it maintains liquidity buffers—including committed revolving credit facilities, liquid investments and diversified funding sources—to meet capital calls, margin requirements and investor redemptions under its various drawdown and open-ended structures. Risk assessment and mitigation is embedded in due-diligence, valuation and compliance processes designed to identify and address uncertainties such as cyber-security threats, data-privacy obligations, regulatory changes, sanctions, trade barriers and climate-related transition and physical risks. The Company employs structured governance and escalation mechanisms—including statutory and contractual covenants, oversight committees and stress-testing frameworks—to ensure that conflicts of interest are managed, legal and tax exposures are controlled, and contingent liabilities such as potential “clawback” obligations and indemnities are recognized and funded. To support resilience across its asset management, capital markets, insurance and real estate businesses, the Company invests in technology platforms and operational tools, adapts its product lineup and fee structures to shifting investor preferences, and engages in ongoing scenario planning for health-system disruptions, credit market dislocations, regulatory reform, and other external pressures, thereby strengthening its capacity to preserve firm performance and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

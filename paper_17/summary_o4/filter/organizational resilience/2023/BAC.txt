Bank of America’s disclosures demonstrate a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, encompassing extensive contingency planning, liquidity diversification and operational continuity measures designed to preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The firm’s financial contingency and recovery plan and single‐point‐of‐entry resolution strategy maintain a robust liquidity buffer of cash and high-quality unencumbered securities, diversified secured and unsecured funding sources, and regularly updated stress tests and scenario analyses to anticipate and address potential contractual and contingent cash outflows in stressed market environments. Operational resilience is underpinned by business continuity policies, backup systems, cyber-security defenses, remote access safeguards, and third-party risk management protocols that seek to mitigate the impact of computer, telecommunications, network or infrastructure outages, natural disasters, pandemics, cyberattacks or vendor failures on critical bank operations, customer services and data integrity. Through integrated governance across front-line units, independent risk, compliance and audit functions, the corporation identifies, measures, monitors and controls key risks—from liquidity and credit risk to technology, information security and operational risk—and implements mechanisms such as system redundancies, disaster recovery plans, specialized asset management for stressed credits, and cybersecurity incident response routines to support recovery, adaptation and the ongoing delivery of essential banking and financial services under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

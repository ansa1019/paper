The company discloses that many of its operations and those of its suppliers are situated in regions prone to earthquakes, natural disasters, industrial accidents, pandemics, terrorism and cybersecurity attacks, any of which can disrupt manufacturing, logistics or service offerings and necessitate substantial recovery time, significant expenditures to resume operations and result in lost sales, underscoring its efforts to maintain business continuity under adverse conditions; it has implemented system upgrades, redundancy measures and disaster recovery planning—even as it acknowledges these may not be sufficient for all eventualities—and has invested in manufacturing process equipment held by outsourcing partners, long-term supply prepayments and noncancelable purchase obligations to help secure component and finished-goods supply, while noting that geopolitical tensions or sudden trade restrictions could force costly and disruptive changes in suppliers or business relationships; to manage financial risks and preserve resource allocation flexibility, the company maintains significant cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accesses debt markets, uses hedging instruments to offset foreign-exchange fluctuations and balances its capital return program of share repurchases and dividends with ongoing investments in research and development and potential acquisitions; the company relies on complex information technology systems and security controls—including encryption, multifactor authentication and continuous monitoring—to protect confidential data and mitigate the impact of ransomware and other malicious attacks, while recognizing that system failures or inadequate vendor continuity measures could impair operations and that its insurance coverage may be insufficient; it has established policies, procedures and training to promote legal and regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection, may enter into settlements to resolve litigation or investigations, and continuously manages the introduction, transition and quality of its products and services, leveraging outsourcing partners to achieve operational efficiencies but accepting reduced direct control and adapting inventory and procurement commitments in response to market volatility—all reflecting its capability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and reconfigure its operations when confronted with internal or external disturbances.

We believe the diversity of locations in which we operate, our operational size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks, including the internet and third-party services, position us well, although they may not suffice for all or for simultaneous eventualities. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events, we could experience operational challenges depending on how those events affect our human capital, the safety and availability of personnel and facilities, and the proper functioning of our or third parties’ computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. Our continued success would depend in part on our ability to find alternative suppliers, replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our information technology or supply systems, or we could be late in delivering—or be unable to deliver—products to our customers, resulting in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns. Pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate such crises have caused—and may again cause—business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and significant financial-market disruption, adversely impacting our global supply chain, factory cancellation costs, store closures, retail traffic, consumer demand and, in turn, our business, sales, financial condition and operating results. Disruptions to our distribution centers, contract manufacturers, factories and vendors through facility closures, increased operating costs, labor shortages or changes in procedures have had—and could again have—a significant impact on our planned inventory production, distribution and ability to meet digital or physical consumer demand, potentially resulting in extended transit times and higher production and logistics costs. We rely heavily on information technology to run our supply chain, retail operations and financial reporting, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of those systems or our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, could delay shipments or financial disclosures, reduce efficiency, cause lost revenues and profits and damage our reputation. Liquidity support for credit and operating needs is provided through committed credit facilities and a commercial paper program, and as of May 31, 2023 our cash, short-term investments and operating cash flow, together with access to external financing, were considered sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital requirements, with full compliance under current debt covenants.

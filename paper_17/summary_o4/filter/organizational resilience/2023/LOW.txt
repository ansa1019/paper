Lowe’s identifies strategic, competitive, operational, and reputational risks that could threaten the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, emphasizing the critical importance of adapting its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address changing customer shopping habits, demands, and demographics and by providing an omnichannel shopping experience through integrated planning, initiative prioritization, and program sequencing. The company’s success is dependent on its ability to identify and respond to economic, social, style, and other trends, to differentiate the customer experience with localized assortments and personalized services, to collect, use, and share relevant customer data, and to provide consistent experiences across channels, thereby preserving or improving functioning despite external pressures. Lowe’s strategic initiatives require new competencies and ongoing adaptations by management, associates, and contractors, and failure to attract, retain, and manage talent with requisite skills could impair strategic resilience. Investments in new technologies, supply chain transformation, market-based delivery models, and a multi-year technology transformation, including modernizing merchandise selling, accounting, and finance systems, underpin operational flexibility and enable rapid reconfiguration of resources; however, execution risks, such as the choice, timing, and pace of investments, as well as complex fulfillment network management, could disrupt operations and impact performance maintenance. The company’s self-insurance programs, excess coverage, and provisioned reserves for workers’ compensation, general liability, and other claims support recovery mechanisms under internal or external variations, while business continuity planning addresses disruptions due to catastrophic events, extreme weather, public health crises, geopolitical conflicts, and cybersecurity incidents, recognizing that breaches or system failures can lead to data loss, operational interruptions, reputational harm, and financial losses. Lowe’s maintains liquidity through cash flows from operations and access to capital markets, supported by revolving credit facilities and commercial paper, alongside share repurchase and dividend programs, to ensure resource deployment under constrained conditions and to sustain functioning under market volatility. The company continually assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets, recognizing potential impairments when assets are more likely than not to be disposed before the end of their useful lives, applying income and market approaches to estimate fair values and discount future cash flows at rates commensurate with market risks. Overall, Lowe’s organizational capabilities, including its ability to adapt, reconfigure, and maintain integrity and performance across internal knowledge domains, supply chains, technology platforms, workforce development, and financial resources, reflect a multifaceted resilience strategy designed to foresee, confront, and benefit from unexpected situations and environmental disruptions.

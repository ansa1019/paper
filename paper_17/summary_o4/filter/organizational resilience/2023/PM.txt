The Company continuously develops and refines its business continuity plans and related safeguards to address a broad spectrum of internal and external disturbances—ranging from geopolitical crises such as the war in Ukraine, natural disasters and pandemics to credit market disruptions, cybersecurity attacks and regulatory shifts—by suspending or scaling down operations where necessary, assessing evolving constraints, establishing alternative production and distribution arrangements (including investing $30 million in a new facility in western Ukraine and sourcing from contract manufacturers outside conflict zones), and maintaining liquidity and financing capacity to preserve operational flexibility. It monitors the stability of its third-party distributors, suppliers and credit markets, acknowledges that such plans “might not always be effective to fully mitigate their impact,” and adapts pricing, product mix and market strategies in response to changing consumer preferences, fiscal, regulatory or competitive environments. The Company implements a comprehensive cybersecurity risk program and third-party cybersecurity risk management processes to prevent unauthorized access, data corruption or extraction that could result in reputational damage or “wide-ranging business interruptions,” and it seeks to mitigate environmental-related risks—such as climate change-driven weather variability, biodiversity loss and water scarcity—by establishing environmental goals and engaging partners committed to resilience. It continuously monitors long-lived and intangible assets for impairment indicators, tests goodwill annually, and orchestrates acquisitions and post-merger integration with rigorous due diligence and oversight to preserve organizational integrity, maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and sustain its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

Schwab’s annual report discloses an integrated risk management framework—encompassing operational, compliance, credit, market and liquidity risk—governed by approved policies, board-level oversight, regular stress testing and contingency funding plans designed to preserve system integrity and maintain operational continuity under both nominal and stressed conditions. The firm emphasizes proactive liquidity management—drawing on working capital, client cash flows, FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, brokered CDs and senior note issuances—to absorb rapid client cash reallocations and interest-rate shocks, and it may curtail share repurchases or redirect capital when regulatory expectations evolve. Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure with geographically dispersed sites, routine business continuity and disaster recovery exercises, and a formal incident management program to mitigate technology failures, cyberattacks or natural disasters. As part of the TD Ameritrade integration, the company aligned risk processes, invested in systems capacity, streamlined operations through workforce and real estate realignment, and targeted annualized cost synergies while preserving service quality. Margin and clearing fund requirements are monitored and recalibrated to manage exposures under market dislocations. Across disclosures on capital management, funding diversity, regulatory capital buffers and detailed contingency planning, Schwab demonstrates its ability to reconfigure resources, allocate funding, respond to external pressures and sustain performance—reflecting its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

The company has undertaken a significant expansion of its manufacturing capabilities and substantial investment in long-term supply agreements to support current and anticipated demand for its products, recognizing that difficulties in predicting or variability in demand and the very long lead times necessary for expansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity have resulted—and may continue to result—in supply disruptions, shortages, and higher costs.  Through internal innovation and business development, it maintains a continuous flow of successful new products and indications sufficient to cover substantial research and development costs and replace revenues lost to pricing controls, lost exclusivity, or competitive displacement, and it manages research and development spending across its portfolio so that a delay or termination of any one project does not necessarily materially change total R&D investment.  A controlled program of risk management, including the use of derivative financial instruments, is employed to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, with an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt and selective use of foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset exchange-rate volatility.  The company continuously evaluates its liquidity and capital resources—believing its available cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flow generation, and access to short- and long-term borrowings are sufficient to fund existing and planned capital requirements—and monitors reliance on third-party suppliers and collaborators, acknowledging that failure of these parties to perform to standards or legal requirements may impair business continuity and require timely sourcing alternatives.  In parallel, the integrity of complex IT systems and confidential information is safeguarded through ongoing measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent failures, breaches, and cyber-attacks, and to enhance the resiliency of IT systems; yet the company recognizes that system inadequacies, security breaches, or compromised third-party systems could result in manufacturing interruptions, data integrity failures, reputational harm, and material financial losses, and it maintains cyber liability insurance while acknowledging that such coverage may be insufficient under certain scenarios.

The Company’s operations incorporate a range of measures to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances, including careful underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs to manage medical cost variability, as well as risk-based benefit products through which the Company assumes both medical and administrative cost risk in return for monthly premiums and fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers designed to reconstitute care delivery toward improved outcomes and lower costs. Information systems resilience is addressed through ongoing consolidation, integration, upgrade and expansion initiatives, significant development and operational resource commitments to protect data integrity and availability, and programs in place to detect, contain and respond to cyber-attacks and other security incidents—including employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and evolving AI/ML threats—which are tested and updated regularly under business continuation and resiliency plans to contain and remediate potential disruptions or cyber events. The Company acknowledges that failures to maintain system integrity or to implement these initiatives successfully could result in operational interruptions, delays or cessation of service, reputational harm, regulatory sanctions and increased costs, and it applies completion factors, medical cost per member per month trend analyses and other risk assessment methodologies to adjust estimates for incurred but not reported claims, thereby preserving performance maintenance and adaptability in the face of unexpected cost trends, pandemics, climate-driven medical emergencies and regulatory changes.

The Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K discloses that it invests in its global resiliency through substantial capital expenditures—$1.3 billion in fiscal 2023—to enhance production flexibility and business continuity across both internal and outsourced manufacturing facilities, recognizing that a prolonged disruption at any facility due to natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest, widespread illness or supply-chain constraints may delay production, shipments and revenue, cause underutilization of capacity, inventory obsolescence and loss of market share, and therefore necessitate risk mitigation, disaster recovery and strategic resource reconfiguration. The report further describes reliance on multiple third-party wafer foundries, raw-material suppliers and logistics providers to manage capacity constraints, single-source risks and fluctuating transportation and labor costs, and underscores that flexibility in sourcing and the ability to adapt production and inventory levels in response to volatile customer demand cycles are critical to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. The Company’s strategy emphasizes continuous investment in research and development to innovate products and processes, maintain technological and competitive advantages and enter new markets in the face of rapid technological change, while also managing workforce, manufacturing and operational cost structures through strategic initiatives, such as voluntary and involuntary reductions in force to align capacity with market demand and guard against economic uncertainty. The Annual Report notes liquidity-management measures, including a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program, to ensure adequate financial resources and operational continuity, and highlights the preparation for and response to exceptional conditions—such as the COVID-19 pandemic—through actions required by government authorities, restrictions on facility access and measures to protect employees, customers and suppliers. Compliance with evolving environment, health and safety standards, export regulations, data privacy laws and complex tax regimes is also depicted as part of the Company’s broader resilience strategy, requiring ongoing adjustments to processes, resource allocation and organizational practices to sustain performance under external pressures and disturbances throughout the business environment.

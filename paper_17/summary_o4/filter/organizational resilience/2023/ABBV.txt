AbbVie’s Form 10-K discloses a comprehensive risk management and strategic framework that supports the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adversity by reconfiguring resources, adapting business practices and leveraging collaborative networks. The company identifies and monitors a broad spectrum of internal and external perturbations—patent expirations and biosimilar competition, cost-containment and pricing reforms under the Inflation Reduction Act, complex global regulatory requirements, foreign exchange volatility, supply-chain dependencies on single-source raw materials and third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, and geopolitical instability—that could materially impair operations, financial condition and cash flows. In response, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development, acquires and licenses key assets, vigorously defends its intellectual property, maintains business interruption insurance alongside self-insured product liability reserves, and ensures operating continuity through a diversified revenue base, strong cash flows, revolving credit facilities and capital market access. These measures illustrate the company’s systemic perspective, operational flexibility, risk mitigation mechanisms and future orientation in sustaining performance under pressure and recovering from disruptive events.

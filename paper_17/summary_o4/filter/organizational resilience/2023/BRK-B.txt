Berkshire and its subsidiaries have established business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to maintain operations under cybersecurity intrusions or other service interruptions, and we employ disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses by taking into account all possible correlations and aggregate exposures from catastrophic events. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis, with few centralized or integrated functions and underwriting responsibility delegated to unit managers, while major investment and capital allocation decisions remain the responsibility of our chairman and CEO, supported by a board-approved succession plan and highly diversified operating managers to preserve decision-making continuity. In the face of terrorist acts, pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, extreme weather, regulatory change or supply chain disruptions, our insurance operations maintain significant float, high short-term liquidity invested in treasury bills, and an emphasis on safety over yield, while our railroad and utilities businesses commit to ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance of infrastructure to ensure operational continuity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. Across all segments we sustain a very strong capital base, redundant liquidity and robust operating cash flows, and we forecast substantial future investments to support core assets, demonstrating our ability to absorb strain, allocate resources effectively and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

In our 10-K, we disclose that to maintain performance amidst volatile market and supply chain conditions we must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage our resources, investments, production capacity, supply chain, workforce and inventory, even as technology inflections, geopolitical turmoil, natural disasters, pandemics and cybersecurity incidents create disruptions. We recognize the need to continue investing in research and development and global infrastructure during periods of economic uncertainty, to implement cost-reduction or restructuring actions when required, and to maintain investment portfolios and cash balances globally to ensure liquidity and business continuity. We describe our processes for monitoring and mitigating risks from part and material shortages, transportation interruptions and supplier failures—and, where necessary, transferring business to alternative sources—to preserve operational flexibility and recover promptly from delays. We also outline enhancements to enterprise resource planning and information systems intended to align our global organization, improve decision making and enable rapid adaptation. In our management’s discussion and analysis, we further detail improvements in inventory and receivables management, including the sale of accounts receivable and discounting of letters of credit, to strengthen working capital, support cash flows and safeguard our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal or external disturbances.

Starbucks discloses that it actively manages risks and costs associated with climate change, energy and water resource constraints and other environmental sustainability matters while acknowledging that management cannot predict all such risks and uncertainties that could materially affect its operations, financial condition and results. The company emphasizes rapid adaptation to changing customer preferences and economic conditions—including response to the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures and shifts in global interest rates—through strategic initiatives under its “reinvention plan,” such as simplifying store administrative tasks, accelerating deployment of purpose-built store formats and investing in partner wages, benefits and training to drive retention, in-store operational efficiencies and sales leverage, thereby supporting sustainable, profitable growth. To absorb volatility in key inputs, Starbucks employs supply contracts with embedded pricing features and commodity hedges, including price-to-be-fixed agreements and derivative instruments, as well as interest rate swaps, treasury locks, cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt to mitigate price, currency and interest rate fluctuations. The company relies on incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, together with significant investments in cybersecurity, technology systems and third-party services, to anticipate and prevent system failures, cyber-attacks and supply chain interruptions, while managing expansion across diverse international markets by balancing local autonomy with consistency in policies and standards. This multifaceted approach—combining resource reconfiguration, strategic foresight, inter-organizational collaboration and dynamic capabilities—reflects the organization’s efforts to maintain system integrity and performance under challenging conditions, preserve brand equity and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

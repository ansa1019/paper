ADP maintains disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect its operations against natural disasters, terrorist actions, power or communications failures and similar events, and devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its information systems, processes and policies to prevent, detect and respond to data and cybersecurity incidents, including evolving techniques of unauthorized access, malicious software infiltration and AI-enabled threats. The companyâ€™s client funds investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal, liquidity and diversification, employing laddered maturities out to ten years and short-term financing arrangements such as commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements, together with committed credit facilities, to ensure the availability of cash to satisfy client obligations, manage interest-rate cycles and contend with systemic banking disruptions. ADP continually invests in system upgrades, research and development and increasingly leverages AI and machine learning to enhance its cloud-based human capital management solutions and service delivery, supporting operational flexibility, innovation, client retention and margin expansion. Transformation initiatives designed to streamline the organization, strengthen talent and culture, and drive revenue growth, productivity and margin improvement are supported by disciplined capital expenditures and governance structures. The firm also employs derivative instruments and robust compliance policies for anti-corruption, privacy, data protection and regulatory requirements and maintains access to diversified funding sources, all of which underpin its ability to absorb strain, preserve integrity and sustain performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional internal and external pressures.

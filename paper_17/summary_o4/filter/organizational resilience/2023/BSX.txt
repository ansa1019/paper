In assessing business continuity under adverse conditions, we recognize that global pandemics or other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could include disruptions in global economic activity, supply chains and labor markets, operational challenges such as site shutdowns, workplace disruptions or limited provider capacity, volatile financial market dynamics and significant price and availability volatility, any of which could adversely impact our operations, customers and suppliers. We further acknowledge that failures to follow internal protocols, equipment malfunctions, environmental factors or damage to facilities could interrupt manufacturing and that, in such events, we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of production or meet customer demand. Disruptions in the supply of materials and components by third-party vendors, driven by inflationary pressures, interest rate shifts or pandemic impacts, could reduce or interrupt supplies or increase costs, prompting us to employ a global supply chain optimization strategy and, as approved in our February 2023 restructuring plan, simplify our manufacturing and distribution network by transferring certain production lines among facilities, expand operational efficiencies and resiliency across production, sterilization and distribution, optimize functional capabilities for growth, achieve cost synergies and deploy resources to support our expanding portfolio and growing markets. To underpin resilience, we maintain liquidity through cash and cash equivalents, access to capital markets and existing credit facilities and invest excess cash in diversified short-term financial instruments to mitigate principal risk. We rely on information technology and operational technology systems, including third-party vendor technology, to manufacture and ship products and process, transmit and store electronic information; we maintain incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, though such plans may not prevent all adverse cyber-events or breaches. Recognizing the risks of climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters, we are focused on energy consumption, carbon emissions and waste management, setting goals for carbon neutrality in scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, fully sourcing electricity from renewables by 2024 and achieving 90 percent renewable energy across our sites by 2027 to reduce potential impacts on manufacturing networks, material availability, energy supply and transportation. We also monitor geopolitical developments – including conflicts in Russia/Ukraine, Israel/Hamas and tensions between China/Taiwan – and evolving regulatory, economic and market conditions to maintain operational flexibility, adapt strategic priorities and mitigate pressures on our performance.

Servicenow maintains crisis management and disaster response plans and backup systems designed to preserve operational continuity and protect customer data, yet acknowledges that major natural disasters, climate change events, pandemics, cyberattacks, geopolitical conflicts and other extreme or exceptional events beyond its control could interrupt its platform, impair service delivery, harm its reputation and financial results and require significant time to resume operations. The company invests in data centers, region-specific hosting and locally based support teams to absorb internal and external constraints, comply with evolving regulations including data residency requirements and enhance system resilience, while recognizing that delays or complications in upgrading information systems, migrating processes or integrating new infrastructure could disrupt business operations, impair customer satisfaction and damage its reputation. To mitigate financial and currency risks and preserve liquidity, Servicenow distributes cash and cash equivalents across multiple financial institutions, imposes investment concentration limits and employs foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge exposures, although such measures cannot entirely eliminate volatility. The company also closely monitors geopolitical events, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and maintains environmental, social and governance initiatives, understanding that sustained or worsened conflicts or failure to meet ESG commitments could materially and adversely affect its business continuity, stakeholder trust and future planning. Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over contract terms, reflecting the platformâ€™s design resilience to maintain performance and provide continuous service under varying conditions.

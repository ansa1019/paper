The company acknowledges that if it is unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with its size—approximately 733,000 employees worldwide—it might be unable to achieve its business objectives, as growing scale can make it increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards, institutionalize knowledge or timely change strategy, operations or culture, sustain its culture, effectively manage and monitor people and operations, communicate core values, policies, procedures, strategies and goals, and motivate, engage and retain employees, particularly given remote work arrangements; it recognizes that size and scope increase the possibility of employee misconduct, including improper use or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, despite efforts to train staff and maintain internal controls, and that failure to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage the enterprise and instill culture and values could impair competitive success. The report further states that changes to the operating model—in response to evolving business needs—must be successfully implemented to avoid negative impacts on the business and results of operations, and that integration of acquired businesses presents risks magnified by transaction volume, potentially disrupting ongoing activities, diverting management attention, and necessitating additional resources, while organizational structure can impede efficient integration of acquisitions and assimilation and retention of personnel; it also notes that loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers and partners may materially impair asset and operational value. It cautions that acquisitions and joint ventures may result in significant expenses—retention payments, equity compensation, severance, early retirement, intangible asset amortization, asset impairment charges and enhanced controls for financial reporting, disclosure and cyber and information security—which could negatively affect profitability as invested capital grows, and that difficulties entering new markets where the company has limited experience or faces stronger competitors could further strain organizational performance.

The Company discloses that it does not maintain redundancy across all critical systems and that its disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities, exposing it to service interruptions and operational disruptions; it acknowledges that failures of its own hardware or software, errors, unforeseen complexity or unplanned transitions among data centers or third-party service providers could result in data loss or corruption, missed service-level commitments, costly notifications, reputational harm and customer attrition; it further recognizes dependencies on third-party distributors, hosting, infrastructure and technology partners as risks to business continuity if such relationships are disrupted or agreements cannot be renewed.  The Company states that it devotes significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through secure engineering, enhanced reliability features, code hardening, rigorous penetration tests, provider control reviews, workforce training and continual incident response improvements, yet concedes that preventative efforts may not fully protect against cybersecurity incidents, which may increase as it expands hosted offerings and integrates new technologies.  It also warns that malicious actors, regulatory changes, evolving AI and privacy laws, macroeconomic volatility, foreign currency fluctuations, geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions and pandemics could materially affect its operations, forecasting, resource allocation and investment decisions.  The Company highlights that catastrophic events, including climate-related disasters, major earthquakes or pandemics, could disrupt its network infrastructure, data centers and cloud services, leading to interruptions, data security breaches and loss of intellectual property.  To enhance its operational flexibility and capacity to recover, the Company has invested in data center and network hardware, maintains short- and long-term investment portfolios, has non-cancellable purchase obligations for critical services, holds lease commitments, and preserves liquidity and strategic adaptability through a revolving credit agreement, a commercial paper program, senior unsecured notes and stock repurchase authority, all intended to support continued performance, resource deployment and resilience under adverse conditions.

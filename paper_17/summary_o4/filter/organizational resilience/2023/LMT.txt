The Company explicitly acknowledges that “risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted” in its government‐contract environment and therefore actively seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to maintain continuity of operations and positive adjustment under challenging conditions. It recognizes that funding uncertainties, including continuing resolutions, budget compromises, contract terminations or delays, and shifting defense priorities impose external pressures and resource constraints that require operational flexibility and adaptation in program execution, resource allocation and contract structuring. To address supply chain disruptions, subcontractor performance issues and geographic or geopolitical hazards, it employs diversified contract types (fixed-price, cost-reimbursable and performance-based payments), multisource procurement strategies, long-term supplier agreements and accelerated payments where needed, thus enhancing resilience in material delivery and cost management. The Company invests in emerging technologies, service innovation and a multi-year digital transformation initiative to enhance enterprise collaboration, increase efficiencies, reconfigure trajectories of response and support rapid adaptation to evolving customer requirements, drawing on both internal and external knowledge through inter-organizational collaboration and joint ventures. Through disciplined portfolio shaping, pension risk transfers and strategic capital deployment—including M&A, divestitures, equity investments, share repurchases and dividend increases—it maintains financial strength and preserve cash flow under adverse macroeconomic conditions such as inflation, interest-rate changes and recessionary pressures. The Company also implements comprehensive compliance programs for procurement laws, cybersecurity threats and environmental regulations, conducts regular risk assessments, and maintains crisis management plans and hybrid workforce models to preserve organizational coherence, safeguard critical capabilities and ensure performance maintenance under internal or external disturbances, reflecting a systemic perspective on organizational resilience.

In its 2023 Form 10-K, NextEra Energy and its principal businesses describe a comprehensive resilience framework encompassing operational, financial, regulatory and strategic dimensions to preserve performance under diverse internal and external pressures.  The companies employ extensive risk‐mitigation processes, including the use of commodity, interest rate and foreign currency derivatives alongside physical supply and storage contracts to hedge fuel and power price volatility, maintain liquidity through revolving credit facilities and project‐specific financings, and secure credit enhancements such as letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees to support energy marketing, construction and project operations.  fpl’s regulatory structure provides for base rates, cost recovery clauses and reserve amortization mechanisms that enable recovery of storm restoration, environmental and plant decommissioning costs, facilitating rapid cost‐recovery following hurricanes ian and nicole and ensuring operational continuity via winterizing, load‐shedding options and accelerated restoration efforts.  The companies maintain substantial nuclear decommissioning and asset‐retirement funds, invested in diversified fixed income and equity securities, to absorb future dismantlement obligations, and periodically update actuarial and inflation assumptions to safeguard system integrity.  nee and fpl systematically address regulatory, legislative and environmental uncertainties—ranging from federal, state and local permitting and compliance requirements to greenhouse gas emission limits and potential disallowances—through proactive planning, reserve funding and capital structure optimization aimed at preserving credit ratings and the ability to access capital and credit markets on favorable terms.  Recognizing threats from severe weather, cyberattacks, terrorism, pandemics and other disruptive events, the companies invest in information technology security measures, back‐up systems, operational redundancy and inter‐organizational coordination to sustain critical functions, safeguard customer data and maintain service reliability.  Strategic initiatives include ongoing investment in wind, solar and battery storage capacity, dynamic portfolio reconfiguration and backlog development to adapt to market shifts and incentive changes, as well as the mobilization of human and financial resources to manage project development, construction and operational challenges.  Through disciplined asset management, credit and performance risk monitoring, contingency planning for supply chain disruptions and customer credit exposures, and the establishment of governance bodies such as a centralized Exposure Management Committee, nee and fpl seek to sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, preserve or improve functioning despite adversity and emerge stronger from environmental, economic or regulatory perturbations.

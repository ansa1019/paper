Abbott’s risk disclosures note that its large, complex global supply chain is vulnerable to internal and external variations, including the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures and labor shortages, and that its performance depends on actions to mitigate such disruptions—for example through investment in information systems and technology to reduce cybersecurity risks, ongoing monitoring for threats and regulatory changes, foreign currency hedging, and prioritization of production—even as supply chain challenges have adversely affected cost and availability of key raw materials, supplies and services. During the pandemic, Abbott mobilized multiple teams to develop and launch diagnostic tests under Emergency Use Authorizations and CE marks, achieving COVID-19 testing-related sales of $7.7 billion in 2021 and $8.4 billion in 2022 before demand declined in 2023 when the health emergency shifted to an endemic state, illustrating operational flexibility and rapid reconfiguration in response to disruptive events. Abbott also managed a voluntary recall of infant formula at its Sturgis, Michigan facility through a consent decree with the FDA, partial production restarts, importation of product from Ireland and Spain, conversion of manufacturing lines and supply reallocation, enabling it to preserve market position and supply continuity despite manufacturing stoppages. While inflationary pressures and resource constraints persisted over the last three years, the impact of cost increases was partially mitigated by price increases and gross margin improvement initiatives, and Abbott reports no significant supply shortages. The company retains financial resilience through readily available liquidity—including $7.3 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5 billion of unused unsecured credit lines—hedging of foreign currency exposure, robust pension funding, continued investment in research and development, and strategic share repurchases and dividend policies, which together support its ability to absorb strain, maintain integrity and continue performance under adverse conditions without material impact to its operations or financial condition, notwithstanding uncertainty related to geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

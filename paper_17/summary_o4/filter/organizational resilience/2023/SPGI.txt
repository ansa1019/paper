Our annual report emphasizes our exposure to numerous internal and external variations and disturbances—ranging from evolving cyber-security threats and technology vulnerabilities to natural disasters, climate-driven extreme weather, geopolitical unrest, and third-party service failures—that could impair our ability to securely process, store, or transmit sensitive data, compromise confidential or material non-public information, or interrupt critical infrastructure, systems and applications. We devote significant resources to maintain, update and remediate our information systems and networks, perform cyber due diligence in acquisitions, enhance policies, processes and internal controls, and maintain disaster recovery plans with backup facilities and business continuity arrangements; however, our systems are not always fully redundant, new processes and cloud-based migrations carry heightened risks of human error and implementation challenges, and we remain exposed to service disruptions, unauthorized disclosures, operational malfunctions or data corruption that could divert management attention, erode customer confidence, result in regulatory or legal actions, financial losses or reputational harm, and require substantial recovery efforts. These measures and our ongoing investments in innovation, change management, and cross-divisional collaboration are intended to enhance our agility, operational flexibility and resilience—our ability to absorb strain, preserve core performance, adapt to pressure, and reconfigure trajectories toward future objectives—but cannot fully eliminate the risk that unexpected events may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We note that global economic and geopolitical conditions, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events may disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on business continuity, requiring disaster recovery planning and system redundancy enhancements. We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders, which may reduce net sales and necessitate software and hardware upgrades. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient, and failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security breaches could expose us or our customers to legal liability, adversely affect our operating results, and harm our reputation. Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly due to seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, placing increased strain on our fulfillment network, inventory management, staffing, and customer service capabilities, and failures to optimize these areas can result in excess or insufficient capacity, increased shipping costs, service interruptions, and impairment charges. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies and suppliers without long-term guarantees, and any inability to negotiate acceptable terms or procure alternatives may hinder our resource allocation and risk mitigation efforts. Complex commercial agreements and rapid international expansion impose significant strain on our management, personnel, systems, and financial resources and require ongoing improvements in process efficiency, lean culture practices, and strategic foresight to preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions. We invest substantially in technology and infrastructure, including scalable AWS services, to enhance resilience through diversified service offerings, automation, and elastic capacity, and maintain insurance, risk assessment, and contingency mechanisms to support operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

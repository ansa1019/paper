The report discloses that “our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively,” and further warns that “changes in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models,” cautioning that “our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior … could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.” It notes substantial forward‐looking investments—“we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in content … before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance”—and describes ongoing technology and security initiatives that “must be constantly monitored and updated in the face of sophisticated and rapidly evolving attempts to overcome our security measures and protections,” reflecting a systemic emphasis on risk mitigation, operational flexibility and business continuity. The risk factors further acknowledge vulnerability to “natural disasters, severe weather events … and a range of other unforeseeable events … which have in the past caused … degradation or disruption of our network, products and services,” and project that “we expect that we will continue to experience some or all of these events in the future,” underscoring emergency management and resilience strategies. In discussing financial resilience, management states that “we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long‐term liquidity and capital requirements … through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facility; and our ability to obtain future external financing,” and acknowledges multiyear programming and production commitments—“we have multiyear agreements for broadcast rights of sporting events … which represent the substantial majority of our programming and production obligations,” and “we have funded and expect to continue to be able to fund our programming and production obligations with the cash generated from our operations”—illustrating the organization’s capacity to absorb financial strain, reconfigure resource deployment and preserve performance under internal and external pressures.

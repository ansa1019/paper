The company’s risk disclosures emphasize its ongoing efforts to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by highlighting the potential for cyber-attacks to disrupt worldwide manufacturing, research and sales operations and the accompanying risk of financial, legal, business or reputational harm; by acknowledging that its significant global operations are exposed to instability, disruption or destruction in key geographic regions—from war, terrorism, civil unrest or natural disasters—which could interrupt its supply chain, impede business continuity and materially affect results of operations; by detailing the physical risks of climate change, including extreme weather, inland flooding and sea-level rise that threaten facility integrity, inventory spoilage and operational continuity; by recognizing potential difficulties and delays in manufacturing certain products—such as shutdowns, quality issues, supply chain delays, raw-material shortages and limits to capacity—that could lead to product shortages and lost sales; by warning that reliance on third-party suppliers, distributors and service providers creates exposure to interruptions that may impede its ability to procure essential supplies; by noting that evolving regulatory, legal and transitional risks in its supply chain may impose increased costs and affect its ability to secure raw materials at required levels; by describing the dependency on sophisticated IT systems and cloud-based platforms and the risk that cyber-attacks, system disruptions or unauthorized use could impair critical business processes and data integrity; by acknowledging that misuse of social media or messaging platforms could lead to information leakage and brand damage; by identifying risks from failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, which could impair its capacity to develop and commercialize products; and by detailing the implementation of global restructuring programs—aimed at optimizing manufacturing networks, increasing operational flexibility and reducing its real estate footprint—that are expected to enhance supply reliability, improve cost efficiency and support the company’s ability to preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances.

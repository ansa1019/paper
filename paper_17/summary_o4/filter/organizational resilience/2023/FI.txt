Our disclosures recognize that our operations depend heavily on the reliability of our systems and are susceptible to operational failures caused by hardware and software defects, ransomware, denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error, natural disasters, pandemics, power losses, telecommunications disruptions, and other internal or external variations and disturbances that could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or data and impair our ability to deliver products and services. In the event of operational failures or damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrences, we may not be able to successfully or quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets and data through our business continuity program. As a provider of payments solutions and other financial services, clients, regulators and others may require enhanced business continuity and disaster recovery plans, including frequent testing of such plans, and meeting these requirements may require a significant investment of time and money. In addition, we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources to maintain and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and mitigate security vulnerabilities, although we cannot be certain that the security measures and procedures we have in place will be successful or sufficient to counter all current and emerging risks and threats. We also face interdependencies with other participants in the global financial system, where the operations and systems of multiple parties must function in concert; despite our efforts to collaborate to avoid disruptions, there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective, and a disruption could lead to our inability to deliver products and services, reputational damage, lost clients and revenue, and additional costs. Our reliance on third parties to provide critical products and services and the risk of disruptions to our supply chain—including temporary closures of manufacturing facilities, workforce shortages, shipping delays, increased lead times, shortages or higher costs for materials and components—require us to find timely suitable alternatives or otherwise reconfigure resource allocations to mitigate service interruptions and financial or reputational exposures. To address competitive pressures and rapid technological change, we emphasize our ability to respond timely by enhancing current products and services, developing and introducing new products and services, expanding our use of data and leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, thereby supporting operational flexibility and competitive advantage. Our liquidity and capital allocation practices, including the use of cash flow from operating activities, available credit facilities and commercial paper programs to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and working capital requirements, reflect our commitment to preserve or improve functioning and performance under varying economic and market conditions. Furthermore, our strategic initiatives to acquire complementary businesses and divest non-core operations demonstrate our capability to reconstitute and reconfigure organizational trajectories toward future objectives, achieve scale, operational efficiency and integration synergies, and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Finally, compliance with evolving laws and regulations necessitates the implementation of policies, training programs, and modifications to business practices or the development of new solutions, and we maintain tax contingency reserves to absorb potential exposures, underscoring our proactive approach to risk mitigation, organizational change processes and resilience engineering.

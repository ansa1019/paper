Our disclosure emphasizes that we rely heavily on third-party manufacturers and logistics providers alongside our internal capabilities to source raw materials, produce drug substance and dosage forms, and manage global shipments, a configuration that may expose us to supply disruptions outside of our control and underscores the need for alternative sourcing options and robust internal processes. We have implemented security measures and maintain cyber liability and pollution insurance to mitigate risks of data breaches, system interruptions, environmental incidents or other extraordinary events, and we have adopted formal business continuity plans designed to recover critical data and sustain vital research, development, manufacturing and commercial functions in the event of crises, while acknowledging that failure to fully execute these plans could materially disrupt our operations. Our use of contract research organizations, clinical trial sites and other collaborators reduces our direct control over pre-clinical and clinical activities and requires continuous oversight and the flexibility to replace parties that fail to meet regulatory standards or performance milestones to avoid delays. We maintain regulated processes and quality systems to comply with evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations governing clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization, recognizing that non-compliance or unanticipated extensions of regulatory review can delay or prevent product approvals. We continue to scale our operational, administrative, manufacturing and workforce infrastructure globally to accommodate growth and the complexity of novel modalities, and we recognize that insufficient adaptation of our resource allocation, failure to retain skilled personnel or inability to expand our capabilities may impair our operational flexibility, strategic agility and overall organizational strength in the face of rapid change and external pressures.

In its risk factors and managementâ€™s discussion, the Company acknowledges that significant fluctuations in service demand or weather-related disruptions can strain its operations and lead to higher operating costs, workforce adjustments and capital deployment challenges, and it therefore continues to improve its transportation plan, add capacity, enhance yard operations and carry a resource buffer to respond to surges in demand; it relies on timely deployment of capital to acquire, develop and maintain information technology systems such as positive train control and transportation control systems and devotes significant resources to cybersecurity risk mitigation while recognizing that no assurance exists that such measures will prevent all incidents; it plans and hardens its infrastructure against severe weather, natural phenomena and climate change by analyzing a range of scenarios, undertaking capacity-enhancing projects and investing in resilient assets; it identifies key supplier dependencies for locomotives, rail and parts and workforce vulnerabilities inherent in collective bargaining agreements, and graduates and hires employees to backfill attrition and cover absences to support service continuity; it employs continuous monitoring of operational metrics such as freight car velocity, terminal dwell time and locomotive productivity to inform proactive interventions and resource reconfiguration using proprietary software to simulate in-train forces and prevent derailments; it deploys additional locomotives and uses predictive technology when network fluidity deteriorates; it recognizes the need for environmental and emergency management in transporting hazardous materials, for robust compliance with cybersecurity and environmental regulations and for adapting to trade interruptions, labor disputes, and public health crises; it maintains liquidity through cash, a revolving credit facility and a receivables facility, analyzes multiple economic and interest rate scenarios, measures its resilience with metrics such as operating ratio, return on invested capital and adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA, and in its 2024 capital plan commits approximately $3.4 billion to support growth, infrastructure hardening, asset modernization and operational efficiency while exploring renewable fuels and low- or zero-emissions propulsion technologies in alignment with its safety, service and operational excellence growth strategy.

The Company operates with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns and expects its merchants to effectively react to rapidly changing opportunities and trends in the market, to assess the desirability and value of merchandise, and to determine how, when and from where to source products. To respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns, it must appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to its stores, maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store, and be flexible in its allocation of floor space among product categories. The flexible off-price model enables the Company to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumersâ€™ changing tastes, and a forecasting process seeks to plan sales and align expenses. The business relies heavily on information technology systems for planning; purchasing; supply chain and inventory management; human resources; financial management; communications; information security; legal and regulatory compliance; and effective disaster recovery plans, and it maintains policies, procedures and controls designed to reduce the risks of cybersecurity compromises, IT failures or disruptions, with ongoing investments in IT security workforce, technologies and processes. The Company monitors debt financing markets on an ongoing basis, manages labor costs amid evolving external wage, benefits and regulatory requirements, and depends upon strong operating cash flows to fund general operating activities, anticipated growth, stock repurchases, dividends and debt repayment. These measures serve to preserve operational flexibility, support resource allocation and mitigate risks arising from temporary store closures, inflationary pressures, global supply chain disruptions, pandemics, severe weather, geopolitical events, and other internal or external disturbances.

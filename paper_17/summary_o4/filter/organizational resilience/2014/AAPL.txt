The company’s risk disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including business continuity and disaster recovery planning, supply chain flexibility, inventory and production management, and financial risk mitigation, all aimed at absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning despite adverse disruptions.  The report cautions that “system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities,” and acknowledges that natural disasters, pandemics, power or telecommunications failures, terrorism, or other events beyond its control could impede manufacturing, logistics, online and retail operations, data security, transaction processing and financial reporting.  To mitigate these risks, the company orders components and pre-pays suppliers based on forecasted demand, invests in manufacturing process equipment held at outsourcing partners, regularly reviews inventories and long-lived assets for obsolescence or impairment, and records reserves for write-downs and purchase-commitment cancellation fees.  The company also allocates substantial resources to research and development to support innovation and competitive advantage, to network security and insurance to protect against cyber-threats, and to liquidity management—holding significant cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accessing commercial paper and long-term debt markets with interest-rate hedges, and managing foreign exchange exposures—to ensure adequate working capital, capital investment capacity and adaptability to market volatility.  These policies and practices, together with compliance, legal contingency planning and strategic financial tools, reflect the company’s efforts to sustain operational flexibility, risk assessment and resource reconfiguration in response to internal and external pressures and to maintain integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

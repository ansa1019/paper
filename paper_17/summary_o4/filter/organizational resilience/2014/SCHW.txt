The company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and has implemented an enterprise risk management framework, overseen by a global risk committee and functional subcommittees, to identify, assess, measure, monitor, and mitigate operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, and legal risks. Business continuity is supported by two data centers intended to improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency, backup and recovery functions with facilities for backup and communications, periodic testing of disaster recovery plans, and policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud, cyberattacks, and unauthorized access to systems and data. The firm manages operational flexibility and liquidity through excess liquidity in overnight cash deposits and short-term investments, diversified funding sources including client cash balances, operating earnings, external financing, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, standby letters of credit, and a universal shelf registration for securities issuances, while meeting regulatory capital and modified liquidity coverage requirements and conducting annual capital adequacy stress tests. Capital planning incorporates risk appetite statements, sensitivity analyses for systemic economic downturns and idiosyncratic events, and a capital contingency plan with guidelines for responding to severe capital stresses, ensuring each subsidiary maintains adequate capital and liquidity through target leverage ratios and contingency funding. The company continually upgrades and standardizes its technology platforms, refines underwriting criteria, establishes risk limits and tolerance levels, and adapts to evolving regulatory mandates and market disruptions—such as changes under Basel III, Dodd-Frank, and liquidity coverage ratio rules—thereby preserving its ability to absorb strain, reconfigure operations, and maintain critical functions under adverse conditions.

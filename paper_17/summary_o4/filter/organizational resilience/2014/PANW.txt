The Company discloses that its operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that, if materialized, could materially adversely affect the business and impede its ability to maintain functioning under adverse conditions.  It warns that rapid growth places a continuous significant strain on its management, operational, and financial resources and that failure to effectively manage any future growth or improve its systems and processes would impair its “ability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings, or to prevent certain losses.”  The Company states that to manage complexity and sustain business continuity it “must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner,” and acknowledges that deficiencies in these systems or third-party software “may disrupt existing customer relationships, cause us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our products, or increase our technical support costs.”  It also notes that its “productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively,” including those acquired, and that any future growth “would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization.”  The Company cautions that its operating results are “likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable” due to a number of external factors, and that “any one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other operating results,” underscoring variability and the need for adaptability.  It discloses risks that “any disruption in our supply chain, by manufacturing or logistics delays, could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, if at all, which may result in the loss of sales and customers” and that reliance on third-party manufacturers “reduces our control over quality assurance, product costs, and product supply and timing,” leaving it susceptible to component shortages, regional disruptions (such as earthquake, flood, pandemic or political unrest), and price fluctuations that could “cause a substantial loss of sales and revenue.”  The Company further acknowledges that defects, errors, or vulnerabilities may cause product failures or “temporarily interrupt end-customers’ networking traffic” and that “any defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products could result in expenditure of significant financial and product development resources, loss of existing or potential end-customers or channel partners, delay or failure to attain market acceptance, and an increase in warranty claims,” highlighting its need to reconfigure resources and processes in response to crises.  It warns that its success depends on “our ability to quickly respond to the rapidly changing and rigorous needs of our end-customers by developing, releasing, and making available on a timely basis new products and services or enhancements,” and that “unanticipated delays in the availability of new products and services … could harm our competitive position and business prospects.”  The Company also describes the risks inherent in its reliance on an indirect sales model whereby “third-party channel partners may market, sell, and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales, and support of such competitive products,” and notes that any failure to manage or incentivize these partners effectively “could harm our operating results.”  It emphasizes that changes in regulatory environments—such as environmental compliance, export controls, privacy laws, and conflict minerals reporting—may require it to reengineer products or incur additional costs, and that its internal controls and financial reporting processes must be continually improved to maintain integrity and guard against “errors, omissions, or fraud.”  Finally, it affirms that preserving its corporate culture, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and maintaining leadership stability are critical to sustaining “innovation, creativity, and teamwork,” without which “our ability to innovate and operate effectively … could be limited,” all of which are essential to the company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve its functioning under challenging conditions.

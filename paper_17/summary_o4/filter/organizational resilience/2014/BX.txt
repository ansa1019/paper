Blackstone’s filings emphasize the firm’s reliance on robust business continuity and disaster recovery programs to preserve core functions such as trading, accounting, communications and data processing in the face of infrastructure disruptions, cyber-attacks or other hazards, and its ongoing assessment of operational risks to prevent system failures and maintain uninterrupted operations under both nominal and extreme conditions. The firm acknowledges that volatile global financial markets, changes in interest rates, credit availability constraints, regulatory shifts and geopolitical events can materially impair its ability to deploy capital, realize investment gains, generate fee revenue and meet debt service obligations, and it therefore continually adjusts its cost structure, including headcount and third-party service providers, to retain operational flexibility, scale back expenses when necessary and safeguard liquidity by drawing on revolving credit facilities, bond issuances and cash from operations. In managing its diverse asset management and advisory businesses, Blackstone highlights its use of rigorous risk assessment, strategic foresight and diversified financing tools to mitigate the impact of market downturns, while maintaining alignment of key personnel through equity-based incentives and fostering a collaborative culture to support adaptability, resource reconfiguration and continuity of its investment and advisory activities under adverse or unexpected conditions.

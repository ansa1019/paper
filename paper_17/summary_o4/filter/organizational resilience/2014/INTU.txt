Intuit’s risk disclosures emphasize that business interruption or failure of its information technology and communication systems – many of which lack redundancy and reside in single data centers without real-time back-up – may impair the availability of its products and services, damage its reputation and harm its operating results; it admits that its disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities, and that natural disasters, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks and other events beyond its control could cause significant system disruption, loss of data or processing capabilities, customer attrition, additional refunds, negative publicity and increased operating costs. The company acknowledges that migrating applications and infrastructure to new data centers and third-party hosted environments, and updating customer-facing applications to meet expectations for continuous service availability, involves execution risks that may lead to unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen cost increases. Because it hosts, collects, uses and retains large volumes of sensitive personal customer and employee information, Intuit recognizes that a major security breach or vulnerability exploitation – whether through cyber attacks, phishing, malicious software, or internal or third-party control circumvention – could materially disrupt its businesses, result in fines, penalties and damages, erode customer confidence and brand value, and trigger further regulation. Intuit also relies on external service providers, sole-source partners and third-party vendors for critical operations, infrastructure and distribution, and warns that the failure of these third parties to deliver acceptable products and services or updates – or the unavailability of reasonable alternative arrangements – may disrupt operations, reduce revenues, cause customer loss and damage its reputation. The company identifies intense competitive and technological pressures, rapid industry change and evolving customer needs that necessitate continued investments in product development, marketing, sales capabilities and information technology infrastructure – including privacy and security capabilities – to adapt to environmental perturbations, innovate, mitigate risk and maintain service continuity. To address seasonality and improve operational flexibility, Intuit will begin delivering ongoing releases for desktop offerings to enhance product experience, accommodate operating system updates and integrate connected services, a strategic adaptation expected to defer approximately $400 million in revenue in fiscal 2015 and partially mitigate revenue fluctuations stemming from its seasonal tax and software businesses. Intuit also underscores the criticality of effective processing systems and controls to manage high-volume transactions in its payroll and payments services, warning that errors or fraud may lead to misappropriation of funds, regulatory liabilities and harm to its business. Finally, it acknowledges that attracting, retaining and developing highly skilled personnel across technical, marketing and staff roles is essential to sustaining innovation, operational management and business continuity under competitive pressures, and failing to secure such human capital resources could jeopardize its ability to adapt and maintain performance under challenging conditions.

In response to fluctuating demand and network capacity pressures, the company continues to improve its transportation plan, add capacity, enhance operations at yards and other facilities, and develop adequate surge resources, while recognizing that these measures may not fully address service shortcomings when demand exceeds planned capacity. Acknowledging exposure to severe weather and other natural phenomena, the company has expanded network operations, added dedicated resources to support growth, improve service and replenish surge capability, and invested in infrastructure upgrades and capacity expansions to mitigate business interruptions. It relies on information technology enhancements, including Positive Train Control and upgraded transportation control systems, to maintain service continuity and manage cybersecurity risks, and employs a multi-faceted safety and risk-mitigation approach—leveraging technology, risk assessment, quality control, training and employee engagement initiatives such as Courage to Care, Total Safety Culture and UP Way continuous improvement culture—to preserve performance under challenging conditions. The capital plan for 2015, approximately $4.3 billion, emphasizes asset renewal, fleet modernization (including 218 locomotives, freight cars and domestic intermodal containers), terminal and classification yard development, and critical technology investments, with the flexibility to revise spending in response to changing business conditions or regulatory requirements. Financial resilience is maintained through a $650 million receivables securitization facility, a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility, access to commercial paper and long-term debt issuances, enabling the company to manage liquidity and resource allocation effectively. The company actively monitors debt-to-capital and adjusted debt-to-capital ratios, employs derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and fuel price volatility, and maintains long-term labor agreements to minimize the risk of operational disruption. In parallel, it addresses environmental and regulatory risks through remediation commitments, ongoing compliance efforts and investments in new technologies and operational practices to reduce environmental impact, thereby preserving system integrity, adaptability and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

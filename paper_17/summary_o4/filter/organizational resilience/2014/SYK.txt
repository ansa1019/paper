Stryker’s risk disclosures and management discussion illustrate its systemic approach to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by relying on comprehensive business continuity plans, extensive information technology systems and network‐monitoring investments to absorb strain and preserve operations in the event of catastrophic events, power outages or cybersecurity breaches; by deploying forward currency exchange contracts and geographically diversified manufacturing facilities to mitigate exchange‐rate fluctuations; by maintaining inventory reserves and managing days‐on‐hand to support demand shifts and acquisitions; and by converting robust operating cash flows into disciplined capital allocation—funding acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases—while supplementing liquidity with debt under favorable credit ratings. The company’s separate dedicated sales forces, sustained research, development and engineering investment, integration processes for acquired businesses and annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite‐lived intangible assets via discounted cash flow models further demonstrate resource reconfiguration and strategic agility. In addition, Stryker records liabilities for product recalls, legal contingencies and uncertain tax positions based on actuarial estimates of probable loss, employs non‐GAAP performance measures to assess underlying trends, and leverages tax and contract management to ensure financial resilience and adaptability amid regulatory, market and technological disruptions.

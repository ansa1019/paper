We have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure, requiring us to manage an increasingly larger and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business, including our hardware and software development, contract manufacturing and purchasing, logistics and fulfillment and maintenance and support; to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems; our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner, may result in disruption of our current operations and end-customer relationships, our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses; we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated; we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 that, if not properly remediated, could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods and impair our ability to comply with the accounting and reporting requirements applicable to public companies, and our remediation efforts are in process and have not yet been completed, creating heightened risk that a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements may not be prevented or detected; compliance with evolving laws, regulations and standards is expected to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, potentially diverting management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities; a significant natural disaster—such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire or flood—or other catastrophic event, including failures in our service providers’ information technology systems, manufacturing or logistics abilities, could have a material adverse effect on our or their business and, if our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers, logistics providers or partners prove to be inadequate, shipments could be delayed, end customers in affected regions may delay or forego purchases of our products, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed; managing the supply of our products and product components is complex, and our inventory management systems and related supply-chain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and manage effectively the supply of our products and product components, such that insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins; our reliance on third-party contract manufacturers and sole or limited sources of supply for key components exposes us to risks of supply shortages or disruptions that could impair our ability to fulfill orders on time, if at all, and materially harm our business; and our operations depend in part on the security of our and our contractors’, distributors’ and channel partners’ information technology systems, such that breaches of our cybersecurity systems, or those of third parties, could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations, delay our ability to recognize revenue, compromise the integrity of our software products, result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property, damage our reputation, expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data.

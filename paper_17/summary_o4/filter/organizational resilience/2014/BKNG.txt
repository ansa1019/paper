The company acknowledges that “other unforeseen events beyond our control, such as oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions, travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics such as ebola, influenza h1n1, avian bird flu and SARS, political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities or travel-related accidents, can disrupt travel or otherwise result in declines in travel demand,” and warns that “because these events or concerns are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services, which can adversely affect our business and results of operations.” To preserve operational integrity under such pressures, the company “maintains redundant systems and hosting services” and invests in capacity expansion to cope with rapid growth, but concedes that “we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur” and that “we do not have a completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business,” noting that system capacity constraints, system failures, denial-of-service or other attacks could lead to unanticipated service disruptions, slower response times and delays in new services, any of which could impair reputation and financial performance. The company also “expends significant resources to protect against security breaches,” including encryption, authentication technologies and phishing defenses, yet recognizes that breaches may still occur and “could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure,” highlighting its ongoing need to allocate resources to risk mitigation, crisis management and recovery strategies in the face of internal and external disturbances.

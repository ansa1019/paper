The company’s disclosures emphasize that its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by a wide range of risks, including additional risks not currently known or deemed immaterial, and by external pressures such as instability, disruption or destruction in key geographic regions from war, terrorism, civil unrest or natural or man-made disasters; manufacturing difficulties or failures to comply with regulatory requirements leading to shutdowns, product shortages and delays; market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit conditions; global economic uncertainty, austerity measures and pricing pressures; and the credit and economic volatility in emerging and developed markets.  The company monitors its data, information technology systems and emerging threats on an ongoing basis and has established revenue-hedging, balance-sheet risk management and net-investment hedging programs that utilize currency options, forward contracts and interest-rate swaps to mitigate volatility in foreign currency cash flows, fair-value exposures and interest-rate fluctuations, although such hedging may be costly and not always successful.  To preserve performance and maintain operational continuity under challenging conditions, the company has executed a multi-year initiative to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus, redesign its operating model, reduce its cost base and divest non-core assets while reallocating resources and reinvesting proceeds into core areas of innovation, returning capital to shareholders, pursuing strategic acquisitions, out-licensing or discontinuing certain pipeline programs, and concentrating R&D efforts on high-value priorities.  These actions have included workforce reductions, real-estate and manufacturing rationalizations, and the consolidation of facilities, with targeted annual net cost savings of approximately $2.5 billion by the end of 2015.  The company’s substantial commitment to internal and external R&D collaboration reflects an investment in dynamic capabilities and absorptive capacity, despite the inherent high failure rates and long investment cycles of new drug development, and impairment charges have been recorded when changes in market or competitive dynamics indicated that certain capitalized intangible assets were no longer recoverable.  Its global operations, inter-organizational collaborations, continuous portfolio assessments and strategic resource generation underscore a systemic perspective on organizational flexibility, risk mitigation and strategic adaptation to environmental perturbations, extreme conditions and regulatory uncertainties—consistent with maintaining positive adjustment and preserving integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

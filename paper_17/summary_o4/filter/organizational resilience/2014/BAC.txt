Bank of America’s primary liquidity objective is to provide adequate funding for its businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress, maintaining a pool of global excess liquidity sources—cash and highly liquid securities—that can be quickly deployed even in stressed market conditions, thereby reflecting a systemic focus on the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. These global excess liquidity sources, along with a diversity of funding sources, serve as a risk mitigation mechanism to enable the firm to absorb strain and preserve ongoing operations despite adversity. The corporation employs centralized asset and liability management activities, including interest rate and foreign exchange hedging, as well as liquidity stress models and contingency funding plans to anticipate and respond to liquidity stress events, envisioning actions such as asset sales, debt and equity issuances, or other de-risking strategies to ensure operational continuity. Bank of America also conducts periodic corporation-wide stress tests, simulating severe economic and market scenarios to assess potential portfolio impacts on balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity, and integrates scenario analysis into its capital planning, risk reporting and limit framework. The firm’s risk framework, approved by the Board of Directors and the Enterprise Risk Committee, emphasizes a strong risk culture and delineates clear roles and responsibilities across front-line business units, independent risk management and corporate audit, to proactively identify, measure, monitor and control strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. In its operational risk management program, the corporation maintains governance structures, risk and control self-assessments, key risk indicators and loss reporting processes, and implements backup systems and safeguards to support critical operations, thereby enhancing its ability to confront hazardous internal and external disruptions. As part of its global compliance program, the corporation establishes standardized servicing and foreclosure practices, and develops remediation and customer assistance processes to mitigate legal, operational and reputational risks across its mortgage and consumer banking activities. This integrated approach to risk and liquidity management, underpinned by contingency planning, market risk limits, operational resiliency routines and dynamic capabilities for transformation, reflects the firm’s capacity to reconfigure its resources, adapt to unexpected situations and emerge stronger following adversity.

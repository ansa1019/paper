The annual report emphasizes the company’s exposure to disruptive events by noting that “investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk” and warning that “if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer,” thereby underscoring its need for positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The description of its global supply chain as “a multi-step international endeavor” dependent on “third-party contract manufacturers” highlights organizational complexity and potential vulnerabilities to supply disruptions, while the establishment of a “corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance” reflects deliberate risk‐mitigation mechanisms aimed at preserving integrity amid regulatory pressures. The report details that “compliance issues identified at any point in the development and approval process” could lead to operational restrictions, demonstrating the importance of operational flexibility and recovery strategies. In response to market changes, the company undertook “restructuring activities” including workforce reductions and “exit and disposal activities related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters,” illustrating resource reallocation and adaptive reconfiguring of its operational footprint. Financial resilience is addressed through a 2014 credit agreement imposing covenants that “restrict or limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions,” thereby formalizing controls over resource deployment under adverse conditions. The company’s acknowledgement that “unfavorable pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement would decrease our future net product revenues and harm our business” and its use of “foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues” further exhibit strategic foresight, risk assessment and systemic measures designed to maintain performance despite environmental perturbations.

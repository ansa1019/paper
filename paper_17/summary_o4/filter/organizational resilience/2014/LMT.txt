The company states that it seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to its business and may, under certain circumstances, continue performance without government funding by using its own funds to meet customer delivery dates, although such funds could be at risk if additional appropriations are not provided. It acknowledges that shifts in U.S. and international spending and ongoing economic pressures create uncertainty, that continuing resolutions and sequestration can cause delays or reductions in contract awards, and that, historically, such funding constraints have not had a material effect due to its ability to absorb funding variations through production contract backlogs in longer-cycle businesses while recognizing that shorter-term contracts are more susceptible to market pressures and to the fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller, price-competitive awards. The company observes that its diverse portfolio of defense, homeland security and information technology products and services makes it less likely that cuts in any specific program will have a long-term effect, but that the termination of multiple or large programs could adversely affect its business and future performance. It explains that its contracts, which include cost-reimbursable, fixed-price incentive-fee and time-and-materials types, afford it rights and remedial actions under applicable laws and regulations in the event of termination for convenience or default, and that it continuously monitors contract-level risks—technical, schedule and cost estimates—to assess profit booking rates, recognize risk retirements or make loss provisions where estimated costs exceed total expected sales. To strengthen its resilience to external pressures and changing customer requirements, the firm pursues portfolio-shaping activities—selective acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments—designed to enhance core capabilities, expand into adjacent markets and grow international sales. It maintains a balanced cash deployment strategy, generating strong operating cash flows to fund capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, while preserving liquidity through revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs and shelf registration for debt securities. Supply-chain resilience is addressed by closely monitoring subcontractor and supplier performance and by maintaining the flexibility to transition work if a partner fails to perform. The company emphasizes human capital resilience by focusing on the recruitment, development and retention of a qualified workforce with requisite skills and security clearances, managing the transfer of critical knowledge to offset demographic shifts and mitigating the risk of workforce disruptions or union actions. It notes that environmental compliance and remediation costs at government-owned or formerly operated sites are accounted for under federal cost-allowability provisions, with liabilities and recoverable assets reviewed quarterly to reflect probable and estimable obligations. Finally, the annual goodwill impairment testing for each reporting unit incorporates discounted cash-flow analyses and market-based valuations that consider budget constraints, program schedule and technical uncertainties, demonstrating a systemic perspective on the ability to preserve integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances.

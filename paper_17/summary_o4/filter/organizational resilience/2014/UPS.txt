UPS discloses that general economic and local environment cycles are beyond its control and that it may be difficult to adjust its business model to mitigate such impacts, necessitating timely responses to competitive pressures to preserve operations and financial performance. Through ongoing adjustments of its integrated air and ground networks—including capacity and cost‐structure realignments, facility automation projects and accelerated deployment of its on‐road integrated optimization and navigation system (ORION)—the company seeks to enhance network capacity, operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability while reducing total cost per piece and matching capacity to fluctuating volume and product mix levels. UPS undertakes strategic initiatives to improve yield management and contain costs, makes significant capital investments in aircraft, vehicles, technology and facilities subject to forecasting uncertainties that may result in excess or insufficient capacity, and intends to fund these investments and its contractual obligations through cash flow from operations and borrowing programs. The company employs a suite of risk‐management mechanisms—derivative instruments to mitigate currency and interest‐rate exposures, indexed fuel surcharges to address energy price variability, self‐insurance reserves and safety and claims management initiatives for workers’ compensation and liability risks, and stringent security and cybersecurity measures to guard against attacks and system disruptions—to preserve business continuity during severe weather, natural or manmade disasters and other unexpected events. UPS has also restructured multiemployer health and pension benefit obligations to limit funding volatility and maintain financial flexibility, collectively reflecting efforts to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external pressures and to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

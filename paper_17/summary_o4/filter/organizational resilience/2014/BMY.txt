Bristol-Myers Squibb acknowledges that it is dependent on a network of suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to conduct research, development, manufacturing, commercialization and other critical functions and has recognized that any failure by a critical third party to satisfy contractual, regulatory or business continuity obligations—particularly under crisis conditions—could materially disrupt operations and financial performance. The company further recognizes that significant breakdowns, invasions, corruption, destruction or interruptions of its information technology systems or those of its third-party providers—whether through cyber-attacks, data leakage, malware, industrial espionage or other threats—could lead to business interruptions, loss of confidential information or reputational harm; accordingly, BMS has invested in industry-appropriate safeguards, monitoring practices and ongoing threat assessments to mitigate such risks, while acknowledging that no measures can guarantee complete prevention. In manufacturing and distribution, BMS faces potential disruptions from product recalls or plant closures, supply-chain continuity breakdowns due to natural or man-made disasters, lapses in supplier compliance with good manufacturing practices, single-source vulnerabilities, regulatory approval delays, capacity constraints, unique-identifier regulations, and other interruptions that could impair product supply and patient access, leading the company to pursue expanded biologics capacity and rigorous risk assessment processes. To comply with SEC requirements limiting sales in excess of expected demand, BMS has instituted a company-wide governance framework to monitor and limit direct-customer and wholesaler inventory levels—drawing on weekly inventory and out-movement data from key wholesalers—and to escalate and resolve any deviations through defined procedures. Financial resilience is supported by a substantial cash, cash-equivalent and marketable-securities portfolio, investment-grade credit ratings, robust liquidity management and disciplined capital allocation to fund dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments and working capital needs over multiple years. Finally, BMS continually transforms its organizational structure and strategy, accelerated by the divestiture of non-core businesses, a focused pivot toward immuno-oncology and other priority therapeutic areas, targeted pipeline investment, prioritized market strategies and a culture of continuous improvement, all designed to enhance the company’s ability to adapt, reconfigure resources and sustain performance under evolving external pressures.

The Company’s disclosure underscores its focus on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by monitoring and responding to a broad range of internal and external pressures that could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. Management acknowledges that it is not possible to predict or identify all potential risks and uncertainties, including pricing and reimbursement pressures from private and public payers, competitor product launches and generic entry, legislative and regulatory changes, currency fluctuations and fiscal constraints in various markets. To preserve or improve functioning despite such adversity, the Company employs risk mitigation strategies such as hedging foreign‐currency exposure, negotiating inventory management agreements with wholesalers, planning for demand and reimbursement variability, allocating resources flexibly between R&D and commercialization, and establishing contingency plans for manufacturing or supply‐chain disruptions, natural disasters, cyber threats and third-party service interruptions. The Company also adapts its strategic initiatives, contractual frameworks and cost structures to sustain performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions, reconfiguring operations, reforecasting demand, managing credit and operational risks, and collaborating across organizational, legal and geographic boundaries to safeguard business continuity, system integrity and long-term organizational resilience.

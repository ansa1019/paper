Comcast’s 2014 Annual Report describes its operations as carried out “in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments” subject to technological shifts and evolving consumer behavior that compel ongoing adaptation and resource reconfiguration, including the deployment of an IP-and-cloud-enabled X1 video platform, cloud DVR technology, wireless gateways and expanded home security and automation offerings, as well as new Ethernet and hosted-voice services for small- and medium-sized businesses.  To preserve or improve functioning and maintain operating margins under external pressures, the company pursues rate adjustments, bundled service packages, the sale of additional and higher-tier services and operating efficiencies, while investing in original programming and sports rights across NBCUniversal’s cable and broadcast networks and in new attractions at its theme parks.  Success is attributed to the ability “to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies,” to reallocate capital and talent toward strategic initiatives such as the proposed Time Warner Cable merger and related divestiture transactions, and to manage regulatory, supply-chain and cybersecurity risks through disaster-recovery planning, insurance programs and vendor oversight.  These efforts reflect a systemic perspective on performance continuity, operational flexibility and dynamic capabilities intended to enable the company to absorb strain, mitigate risks of disruptions or failures, and respond effectively to environmental perturbations, competitive threats and unexpected situations so as to maintain or improve overall firm performance.

Mastercard maintains an information security program subject to board review and a business continuity program alongside insurance coverage, embedding multiple layers of protection in its global processing systems to analyze risks, assess potential impacts and develop timely response strategies for disasters, technology failures, cyber-attacks or third-party service interruptions, recognizing that any disruption to authorization, clearing or settlement channels could materially impair its performance. The company supplements these measures with comprehensive settlement and other risk-management practices, including unlimited guarantees of issuer and acquirer settlement obligations supported by a dedicated credit facility and the right to assign underlying receivables, in order to absorb liquidity shortfalls, preserve system integrity and maintain functioning under extreme or unexpected conditions. In the face of intense legal, regulatory and competitive pressures on interchange fees, network rules and cross-border transaction volumes, Mastercard allocates substantial management and financial resources to defend its fee structures in legislative and litigation proceedings, renegotiates customer agreements to balance rebates and incentives against volumes, and restructures its legal and tax entities to align its operational footprint with strategic objectives and optimize global cash deployment. The firm continually monitors geopolitical, economic and regulatory developments across more than 210 countries, leverages acquisitions and targeted investments to expand its capabilities, and routinely tests and enhances its controls to address evolving security threats, foreign exchange volatility and settlement exposures, thereby reinforcing its capacity to preserve organizational integrity, flexibility and performance in the presence of internal and external disturbances.

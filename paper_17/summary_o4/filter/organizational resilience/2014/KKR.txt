Kkr discloses that it continually seeks to mitigate known risks to the extent practicable but makes no assurances its mitigation efforts will succeed, acknowledging that volatile financial and economic conditions—such as interest‐rate fluctuations, credit availability, currency movements and commodity price swings—lie outside its control yet can materially impact its business continuity, liquidity, capital deployment and firm performance. It recognizes that large-scale disruptions—from market stress to cyberattacks, natural disasters or data breaches—could impair its financial, accounting and information‐technology systems, physical infrastructure in New York City and third‐party service providers, and that its business continuity and disaster recovery programs, as well as insurance, may be insufficient to prevent operational interruption. Kkr also faces extensive regulatory, environmental, tax and legal pressures across jurisdictions requiring ongoing risk assessment, compliance monitoring, adaptation of internal controls and resource allocation, while significant leverage, contingent liabilities (including clawback and net-loss-sharing provisions) and complex contractual commitments expose it to funding and refinancing risks that demand contingent planning, operational flexibility and adaptive strategies to preserve organizational resilience under challenging conditions.

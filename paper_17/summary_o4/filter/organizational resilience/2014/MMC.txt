In our risk and insurance services segment, we establish loss contingencies by utilizing case‐level reviews by inside and outside counsel, internal actuarial analyses and other analyses to estimate potential losses and recognize a liability when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, reviewing and adjusting that liability quarterly as developments warrant; given the unpredictability of errors and omissions claims and related litigation, an adverse outcome could materially impair our business, financial condition or cash flows in any period. The geographic breadth of our operations subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks—including unexpected increases in taxes, changes in foreign and domestic laws, trade sanctions, anti‐corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity requirements, and limitations on currency conversion and repatriation—that may impede our ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under adverse conditions. We engage in periodic testing and maintain policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information; however, testing may not discover all system deficiencies, our safeguards may be insufficient to prevent improper access or disclosure, and we may be unable to detect or respond to incidents in a timely manner, while significant costs are involved in maintaining and upgrading our technology infrastructure, particularly in connection with the integration of acquisitions. Should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem—such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss or telecommunications failure—our ability to continue operating will depend on the availability of personnel, office facilities and properly functioning computer, telecommunications and related systems, and our inability to successfully recover could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability. We regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession, recognizing that a disaster on a significant scale affecting key operating areas could materially interrupt our operations. Our businesses also face rapid technological changes and must identify and integrate current technologies and methodologies into service offerings, pursue strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support growth, and deploy new processes and role changes to capture efficiencies; failure to anticipate or respond to such changes adequately or execute our strategic initiatives could adversely affect our operations. A significant portion of our total operating expenses is relatively fixed in the short term, so variations in the number or timing of client assignments can cause significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results, underscoring the importance of operational flexibility and resource allocation in adapting to demand changes. Credit rating downgrades would increase our financing costs, limit access to capital and amplify operational risks through higher costs and competitive pressures. In establishing professional liability reserves, complying with evolving regulatory requirements, managing global economic and political volatility, and maintaining business continuity and information security, we describe risk assessment processes, adaptation mechanisms and resource deployment strategies intended to enable us to absorb strain, preserve integrity and sustain performance under challenging and disruptive conditions.

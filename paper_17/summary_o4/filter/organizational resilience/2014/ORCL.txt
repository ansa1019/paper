We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict, and political unrest, natural disasters and potential public health crises continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could cause customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets, delay or cancel purchases or delay payments. Our “pipeline” estimates can prove to be unreliable because the “conversion rate” or “closure rate” of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate and, in addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to predict how their pipelines will convert, which, together with a cost structure that is largely fixed in the short term, could disproportionately impede profitability. Our cloud computing strategy, including our Oracle Cloud software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service offerings, may not be successful and, if we do not successfully execute our strategy or anticipate customer needs, our revenues and profitability could decline; we incur infrastructure and marketing expenses in advance of our ability to recognize the related revenues and could experience volatility in our reported results due to differences in the timing of revenue recognition, and the integration of acquired cloud companies may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated, which could adversely affect our ability to fully realize the benefits anticipated from those acquisitions. Our success also depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing offerings, and if we fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services, our financial performance could suffer. If our security measures for our software, hardware, services or Oracle Cloud offerings are compromised and our or our customers’ data are accessed improperly, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, the services we provide could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our offerings, all of which could reduce our revenue, damage our reputation and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions. While our active acquisition program strengthens our competitive position and expands our offerings, acquisitions present many risks and may disrupt our ongoing business and divert management’s attention through acquisition, transition or integration activities. Our periodic workforce restructurings, including reorganizations of our sales force, can be disruptive, resulting in increased restructuring costs, increased sales and marketing costs and temporary reduced productivity while the sales teams adjust to new roles and responsibilities. Our hardware systems business may likewise adversely affect our overall profitability if we do not effectively manage associated risks, including dependency on a limited number of manufacturing partners and single-source components, inventory shortages and delivery delays that could impair our ability to ship products and lead customers to purchase from competitors. We may also fail to maintain, expand or develop relationships with channel participants, which could cause us to lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues. We rely on the continued service of our senior management and other key personnel and face substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled technical and other personnel; if we are not successful in recruiting, retaining and motivating employees, our operations may be disrupted. Finally, business disruptions such as earthquakes, fires or other catastrophic events that disrupt any of our critical business or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our future operating results, and adverse litigation results could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition.

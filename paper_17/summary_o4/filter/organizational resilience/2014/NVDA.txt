In our annual report, we disclose that business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs, as our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change; the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations and may cause interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers, adversely impacting our ability to fulfill orders, interrupt other critical functions, incur delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers, reduce expected revenue, increase expenses and damage our reputation. We further note our dependence on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and exposes us to risks including a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components, higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints, failures to procure raw materials or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity, inability to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies, loss of a supplier and related production delays, lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quality, delays in shipments, shortages, decreased product quality and/or higher expenses if subcontractors prioritize competitorsâ€™ orders. Our reliance on third-party software development tools to assist in the design, simulation and verification of new products may lead to delays or missed design cycles if such tools cannot fully simulate complex features and functionalities, resulting in lost design wins and harm to customer relationships. We recognize that failures to achieve expected manufacturing yields require analysis and cooperation with foundries to resolve issues, may necessitate allocating available product supply among customers and could harm our financial results and reputation. Our inventory provisioning processes, based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions, are subject to uncertainties from changes in business and economic conditions, rapid technology transitions, cancellation or deferral of customer orders and competitive pricing actions, any of which could result in excess or obsolete inventory, inventory write-downs or write-offs, reductions in average selling prices and adversely affect our financial results. We also disclose potential security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks as risks that could disrupt our operations, misappropriate or compromise confidential information, damage our brand and increase expenses. Our liquidity and capital resources, including cash generated from operations and investments in high-grade securities, are managed under policy guidelines, and failure to obtain sufficient capital could require us to curtail capital expenditures or research and development activities. These disclosures on risk mitigation, resource allocation, operational adjustments and recovery efforts reflect factors that may impact our ability to maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions and unexpected situations.

The Company maintains business continuity and risk‐management programs across its global operations, including formal information risk management and cross‐functional oversight, regular analysis of emerging risks and associated remediation plans, and water stewardship initiatives that assess and mitigate water‐related constraints in bottling operations. It employs derivative hedges for interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange exposures and conducts recoverability and impairment tests of noncurrent and intangible assets using discounted cash flow models and market‐participant assumptions to preserve system integrity and adapt to market and environmental turbulence. Strategic actions such as refranchising North American territories, simplifying the operating model, expanding productivity and reinvestment programs, integrating bottling and distribution operations, and targeting brand and growth investments exemplify resource reconfiguration, operational flexibility and organizational change processes designed to strengthen system resilience. The Company’s governance, incentives for independent bottling partners and disciplined compliance policies support adaptation to evolving consumer preferences, regulatory developments, disruptive events, economic volatility and catastrophic risks, thereby preserving financial strength, operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

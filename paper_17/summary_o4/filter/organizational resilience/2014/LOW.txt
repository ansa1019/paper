We have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business; this process is administered by our chief risk officer and includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify. We recognize that our ability to adapt our business concept in a rapidly changing retailing environment—to increase urban market presence with smaller-format stores; to invest extensively in online sales, content marketing and information-searching technology capabilities; and to transform from a single-channel home improvement retailer to an omni-channel home improvement company—is critical to our future success and depends on integrated planning, initiative prioritization, program sequencing and a leadership development program that aligns corporate strategy, business-unit strategy and integrated planning to drive execution and timely delivery of new technology solutions. As customer-facing technology systems become increasingly important to our omni-channel strategy, their performance, reliability and the existence of a disaster recovery plan are essential to preserving positive customer experiences and ensuring business continuity, while the maintenance and ongoing improvements of our management information systems—supporting inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, transportation, receipt processing and product delivery—are key to achieving efficiencies, cost reductions and sales growth. We also face the imperative of protecting sensitive customer, employee, vendor and company information through continual investment in information security and compliance with evolving regulations; of managing inter-organizational collaboration with over 7,000 domestic and international vendors and third-party installers to mitigate supply-chain disruptions, quality risks and legal exposures; and of recruiting, training and retaining a culturally diverse workforce with expanded skill sets to meet competitive pressures and customer needs. Our liquidity and capital resources strategy—with cash flows from operations, a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (with a $500 million letter-of-credit sublimit), access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets and disciplined share-repurchase and dividend programs—is designed to provide the financial flexibility necessary to fund operating requirements, technology and store investments, expansion plans and shareholder returns, while we continuously assess potential impacts from debt-rating changes, economic volatility, regulatory shifts and other external disturbances. In outlining expectations for sales growth, operating margin expansion and capital deployment, we qualify our forward-looking statements by the risks and uncertainties inherent in adapting to environmental disruptions, competitive pressures, technological change, regulatory complexity and other factors that could affect our ability to maintain performance, integrity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

Throughout our 2014 annual report, we describe a variety of operational, financial and strategic measures intended to preserve integrity of performance under internal or external disruptions, consistent with the academic definition of resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.” For example, we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures and maintain treasury policies that ensure adequate liquidity, including a commercial paper program, an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility and an investment portfolio of available-for-sale securities designed to meet working capital needs. Under our retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account to fund monetary liabilities arising from covered litigation and record corresponding accruals, thereby insulating our operating cash flows from adverse judgments. We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses due to counterparty failures, restrict settlement exposure with global credit settlement risk policies requiring collateral and estimate settlement guarantees systematically. We promote a consistent account holder experience by enforcing network exclusivity and routing rules, invest significantly in technology assets and processing-network infrastructure, and maintain policies, procedures, systems and controls to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions, data security breaches and fraud. Recognizing the criticality of uninterrupted transaction processing, we engage multiple service providers, operate redundant global data networks and conduct risk assessments on operational continuity, while acknowledging that service interruptions, disruptions or security compromises could degrade performance, brand reliability and revenues. To support long-term growth and adaptation, we allocate resources to client incentives and marketing, negotiate performance-based incentives under long-term contracts, and invest in strategic acquisitions, infrastructure and digital solutions. Combined, these measures reflect our multi-faceted approach to adaptability, risk mitigation, resource reconfiguration and organizational transformation across hierarchical levels and inter-organizational collaborations to preserve system integrity, continuity of service and strategic agility in the face of regulatory, competitive and economic perturbations.

Abbott’s annual report describes a range of measures and disclosures that collectively contribute to the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including strategic resource allocation, operational flexibility, and risk mitigation mechanisms. The company may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, while acknowledging that it may not integrate acquisitions successfully or transition disposed businesses efficiently and could incur or assume significant debt and contingent liabilities. To reconstitute and preserve functioning in the face of disruptions, Abbott initiated investments in the third quarter of 2013 to rebuild consumer confidence after a supplier-related product recall and had recovered from this disruption by mid-2014, and it increased local presence by investing in global infrastructure—opening three manufacturing plants in China, India, and the United States—and forming a strategic alliance with Fonterra to develop a proposed dairy farm hub in China. The report also details ongoing monitoring and management of manufacturing risks—such as equipment malfunctions, protocol failures, raw-material problems, natural disasters, and environmental factors—and of financial risks, including cost containment efforts by governments, foreign currency fluctuations mitigated through hedging arrangements, and credit exposures on trade receivables, with reserves adjusted based on historical trends and customers’ payment plans. Abbott has invested in its information technology systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of invasion or interruption and monitors these systems on an ongoing basis for current or potential threats. The company maintains readily available liquidity through unused lines of credit of $5.0 billion supporting commercial paper borrowings and manages pension funding and share repurchase authorizations to preserve financial flexibility. Transitional services agreements entered into in connection with the separation of AbbVie and with the disposition of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business ensure continuity of processes and stand-alone capabilities. Finally, Abbott’s research and development process is governed by disciplined portfolio management—setting annual spending targets of approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of sales and recognizing the high rate of failure and potential for significant delays—to support ongoing adaptation, performance maintenance, and future orientation in a turbulent business environment.

Our risk disclosures emphasize the importance of maintaining reliable, scalable infrastructure and the ability to recover under adverse conditions, noting that “our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business,” and that “we could experience interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, or other catastrophic events,” in which case “we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services.” We acknowledge that although “we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security,” and that “any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.” We further describe strategic actions taken to enhance long-term continuity, explaining that “we may take steps that result in limiting distribution of mobile products and services in the short term in order to attempt to ensure the availability of our products and services to users over the long term,” and that “we prioritize user growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results,” sometimes making product decisions that “may reduce our short-term revenue or profitability” if they are expected to benefit the aggregate user experience and long-term performance. In managing regulatory and technological uncertainties, we note that “to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the United States and are applying for certain regulatory licenses in Europe,” and that we remain “dependent on the interoperability of Facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control,” any changes to which “could adversely affect Facebook usage and monetization on mobile devices.” We describe the complexity and risk of expanding our technical infrastructure ourselves, warning that “unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products.” We also commit to periodic reassessment of our financial and operational metrics, stating that “we regularly review our processes for calculating key metrics, and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics,” and we recognize impairment risks by noting that “we review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.”

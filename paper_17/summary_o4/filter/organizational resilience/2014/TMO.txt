The company’s strategy to augment internal growth at existing businesses with the development and commercialization of its own technologies and complementary acquisitions, together with divestitures undertaken as conditions to obtaining antitrust approvals, underpins its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. By integrating acquired operations into its four reportable segments and continuously reconfiguring its portfolio, the company maintains operational flexibility and competitive advantage in the face of environmental disruptions. Productivity improvements delivered through its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, global sourcing initiatives, facility consolidations and headcount reductions, as well as low-cost region manufacturing, serve as resilience mechanisms that reallocate resources, mitigate cost pressures and enhance responsiveness to unexpected market fluctuations. Liquidity and financial resilience are sustained through a diversified mix of cash and short-term investments, projected cash flow from operations and a multi-currency revolving credit facility, with undrawn capacity maintained to provide an alternate source of funds if commercial paper markets become unavailable. Management’s critical accounting policies, which rely on historical experience, market and economic conditions and reasonable assumptions, support the system’s integrity by estimating allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory writedowns, contingent liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits, and by reviewing intangible and long-lived assets, goodwill and pension obligations for impairment when adverse business conditions, economic factors or technological changes emerge. The company records accruals for various contingencies—legal proceedings, environmental remediation, warranty obligations and product liabilities—based on the probability of loss and historical claims experience, reinforcing its capacity for risk mitigation, crisis response and performance maintenance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

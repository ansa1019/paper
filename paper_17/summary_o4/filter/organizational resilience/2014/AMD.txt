In the risk factors, management emphasizes that “it is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand” and recognizes that “if we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers,” underlining the need for resource allocation under pressure; it notes that “failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results” and that “if our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays”; the report asserts that “the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions” and that “our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets”; strategic initiatives include implementing a “2014 restructuring plan designed to improve operating efficiencies,” realigning the organization to address “high-growth adjacent markets” and managing potential adverse impacts on employee morale and operational targets; financial continuity is addressed by “regularly assess[ing] markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing,” balanced against the risk that “additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed”; the discussion of business continuity extends to “internal business processes and information systems,” which “need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks,” prompting “simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts”; IT and security risks are acknowledged in that systems “may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events … cyber-attacks, data breaches … exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business”; market volatility and uncertainty are highlighted in the observation that “a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter,” increasing “the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition”; inventory management is addressed through the warning that “we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders … could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins”; supplier and partner dependencies, including third-party design, manufacturing, logistics and distribution relationships, are flagged as risks that “could materially adversely affect” the business if not properly managed; integration challenges are noted in connection with acquisitions where “we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations”; and global operations resilience is underscored by a list of “political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters” in international jurisdictions, alongside measures such as hedging foreign currency exposure and diversifying supply sources to mitigate external pressures.

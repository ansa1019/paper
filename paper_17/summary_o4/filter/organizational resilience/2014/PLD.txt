The Company conducts a significant portion of its business globally and employs a substantial number of people outside the United States, subjecting it to social, political and economic risks and exposing it to potential currency restrictions, volatility and complexities that it seeks to mitigate through borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies, derivative contracts and by evaluating its insurance coverage for hazards such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods to preserve operational continuity under adverse conditions. The Company’s global growth requires funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations and monitor compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. To manage its liquidity and resource allocation, the Company may divest properties, incur debt, enter into leases on less-favorable terms or lease renewals without rental increases if cash from operations and available credit facilities are insufficient to continue business as usual. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets, system failures, cyber security attacks or environmental hazards could interrupt operations; accordingly, the Company has implemented security measures, a disaster recovery plan and disaster insurance subject to coverage limitations and evaluates these arrangements annually, on occasion electing to self-insure where commercially reasonable. The Company’s dependence on the efforts of executive officers and other key employees is recognized as a potential impediment to organizational adaptability and operational flexibility should turnover occur. The development program focuses on maintaining control of well-positioned land, capitalizing interest, taxes and G&A during construction and recognizing that development and repositioning entail significant commitments of financial and operational resources. The Company employs a same-store analysis to assess performance independent of portfolio changes, and evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, environmental liabilities and co-investment ventures’ debt to preserve system integrity and ensure sufficient cash flows to meet debt service, dividend and distribution requirements under REIT rules. To hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures and extend debt maturities, it issues senior notes in multiple currencies, enters into term loans with reinvestment capability and maintains credit facilities, all subject to covenants. The scale and quality of its operating platform, the skills of its team and the strength of its balance sheet furnish competitive advantages and enable economies of scale, permitting continued investments in acquisitions, developments and co-investment ventures while monitoring market fluctuations, regulatory changes and external disturbances to maintain performance under pressure.

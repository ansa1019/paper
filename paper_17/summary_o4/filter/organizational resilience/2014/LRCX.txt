The company explains that the semiconductor equipment industry’s inherent demand fluctuations require management to adjust spending and resource allocation to operating activities, continuously reassess strategic resource choices in response to changing business conditions and deploy cost management programs to align expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, sometimes necessitating restructuring actions. It acknowledges that during periods of rapid growth or decline it faces significant challenges in preserving adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, workforce training procedures and supply-chain infrastructure sizing on a timely basis, and that failure to meet these challenges could materially impair gross margins and earnings. Even in downturns, the company asserts the necessity of sustaining research and development investments and maintaining extensive global customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive. It further recognizes that its revenues and operating results may be subject to unpredictable fluctuations from factors beyond its control—ranging from supplier performance failures and customer cancellations to transportation, communication or natural disaster disruptions—and seeks to mitigate such risks through foreign currency hedging, risk assessment and emergency recovery processes for critical information systems. Finally, the company emphasizes the importance of preserving sufficient liquidity reserves, noting that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 29, 2014 are expected to support operations, capital expenditures, debt service and requisite investments through at least the next twelve months.

Risk factors and risk-mitigation measures described in this report reflect a broad focus on preserving integrity and performance under internal or external disturbances and maintaining business continuity in the face of adversity.  For example, the Company notes that “uncertainty about current global economic conditions continue[s] to pose a risk as customers may postpone or reduce spending in response to restraints on credit,” that “there could be additional effects from adverse conditions in the credit markets on our business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance the development and/or manufacture of our products resulting in product delays, and the inability of our customers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products,” and warns that “if economic conditions worsen or if the improved economic conditions are slower than anticipated, our forecasted demand may not materialize to the levels we require to achieve our anticipated financial results.”  To mitigate foreign exchange risk, the Company “attempt[s] to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense,” establishing and regularly reviewing a hedging program “to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,” although it cautions that “our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates.”  Customer credit risk is addressed through monitoring and mitigation programs in leasing arrangements, yet “there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective.”  The Company also highlights operational flexibility challenges, noting that “natural disasters, terrorist activities and other business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition” in the absence of multiple-site capacity, that “epidemic diseases or the perception of their effect could have a material adverse effect on our business,” and that disruptions in critical information systems or material security breaches “could harm our business, customer relations and financial condition” if resources are not allocated “to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure.”  Manufacturing resilience depends on capacity to scale, qualified personnel, supplier continuity and compliance with rigorous U.S. and international quality systems; the Company discloses that “if our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal, state or other manufacturing standards, we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations, import/export of our products and/or recall some products which would result in significant product delivery delays and lost revenue.”  The Company further identifies regulatory resilience as a multifaceted process requiring extensive design, testing, complaint reporting, corrective and preventive actions and field corrections under FDA regulations and international directives, describing past FDA inspections that yielded Form FDA 483 observations and a warning letter to which it responded with corrective actions and received written closure, while acknowledging that “we cannot assure that the FDA will not find other observations in future inspections.”  Integration resilience is reflected in the caution that “if we fail to successfully acquire or integrate new businesses, products and technology, we may not realize expected benefits or our business may be harmed,” given the time, cost and complexity of transitioning sales, marketing, regulatory and operational functions.  Business model resilience is supported by a balance of initial capital sales and recurring revenue from instruments, accessories and service contracts that have historically grown faster than system revenue, but is subject to fluctuations from seasonality, reimbursement variability, competitive pressures, negative publicity, and long, variable sales cycles.  Finally, the Company recognizes that “we use estimates, make judgments and apply certain methods in measuring the progress of our business,” acknowledging that changes in assumptions and methods may “adversely affect our reported financial results,” and that “although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, there can be no assurance” that any single risk-mitigation measure will fully prevent impairment of functioning under challenging conditions.

T-Mobile’s disclosures reflect a broad spectrum of resilience strategies encompassing business continuity, risk mitigation, operational flexibility and financial adaptability. The company highlights its imperative “to provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service” and protect against “system failures, business disruptions, and unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems,” recognizing that such events could “prevent us from providing reliable service,” “cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses” and necessitate “remediation costs” including “repairing infrastructure and systems.” To absorb internal or external variations and preserve performance under capacity pressures, T-Mobile invests in network modernization and spectrum acquisitions while addressing risks from “supplier failures or delays,” “regulatory permitting issues,” “scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints” and anticipates that “these risks will be reduced as work is completed.” Cyber-resilience is pursued through processes “to protect against unauthorized access,” with an acknowledgment that threats are “continuously evolving” and require the company “to continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes.” Supply-chain resilience is supported by diversified vendors, and liquidity resilience by maintaining “sufficient sources of funding to meet anticipated liquidity requirements,” including a two-year receivables factoring arrangement and ongoing reviews of “projections for changes in … financial and operating results, general economic conditions, [and] the competitive landscape.” The phased deployment and parallel operation of a new billing system exemplify structured change management and crisis management to avoid “major system disruptions.” Financial resilience measures include establishing allowances for credit losses on installment receivables by discounting at an imputed interest rate, straight-line recognition of tower lease expenses with renewal penalties, annual impairment testing of goodwill and spectrum under “events or changes in circumstances,” and maintaining guarantee liabilities for handset trade-ins based on “estimated remaining eIP balance” and “expected fair value of the used device,” collectively demonstrating T-Mobile’s capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, and maintain integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances.

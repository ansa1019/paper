Goldman Sachs maintains substantial liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in the event of a stressed environment, pre-funding its estimated needs through “global core liquid assets” comprised of unencumbered highly liquid securities and cash, and applies asset-liability management and diversified funding sources to preserve its integrity and performance under challenging conditions. The firm conducts regular scenario analyses – including its internally developed severely adverse scenario – as well as value-at-risk and sensitivity measures to stress-test its capital and liquidity adequacy, informing a detailed contingency funding plan that outlines crisis management actions, potential emergency financings, and resource reallocation strategies to ensure operational continuity and rapid reconstitution of trajectories toward the future. As part of its recovery and resolution plans, the firm develops strategies for orderly resolution, recapitalization of subsidiaries, and reconfiguration of its balance sheet in response to disruptive events, thereby enabling partial maintenance of integrity and performance, at least partially, while under internal or external variations and disturbances. Operational risk management encompasses a multifaceted framework of policies, processes and controls – from model validation and cyber-security measures to business resilience and technology risk governance – designed to identify, mitigate and learn from errors, system failures or external threats, and to support a future-oriented, systemic perspective that ensures adaptive flexibility, inter-organizational collaboration, and the maintenance of positive adjustment under unexpected situations.

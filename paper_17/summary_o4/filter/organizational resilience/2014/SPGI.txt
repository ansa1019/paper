We and our subsidiaries operate in capital, commodities and commercial markets subject to volatile macroeconomic, regulatory and legal pressures that could impair our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. In the normal course of business, both in the United States and abroad, we are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and frequently subject to government and regulatory investigations, and we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict their outcomes and effects on our financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record additional liabilities in future periods. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and materially adverse effects from unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access. Many of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers depend on the capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the Internet; any infrastructure or network failures, malicious software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party providers or increased government regulation could impair our ability to process transactions rapidly, deliver substantial quantities of data or serve our customers. Although we maintain disaster recovery plans and backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not fully redundant and our plans may not always prove sufficient or effective, which could affect our ability to store, handle and secure data and information. We rely on third-party providers for essential support functions and outsourced infrastructure; if those providers do not perform efficiently, fail to expand services to meet our needs or discontinue services on acceptable terms, we could experience business disruption, processing inefficiencies, reduced revenues and higher costs. Our operations may be materially and adversely impacted by disruptions in the infrastructure supporting our businesses and the communities in which we are located—whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, sabotage, terrorism or political unrest—and if such disruptions prevent our personnel from utilizing systems or traveling to alternate locations, their ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer. We are implementing an enterprise-wide financial processing system and expect significant benefits, but there can be no assurance these initiatives will deliver as planned; failures could impair transaction accuracy, efficiency and overall business continuity. We also seek to build resilience through the strategic reallocation of resources, divesting non-core assets while investing for growth in markets that have size and scale, streamlining our real estate footprint and optimizing capital structure to maintain a strong financial position. We believe that cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future, thereby supporting our ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and adapt to unexpected economic or market fluctuations.

Nike’s risk disclosures recognize its exposure to a range of disruptions—from interruptions in data and information technology systems to extreme weather, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts, military conflict, port strikes and logistical delays—and acknowledge that business interruption insurance and continuity plans may not fully mitigate impacts or restore operations promptly. The company highlights its reliance on a concentrated network of independent contract manufacturers and the associated risk that failures to ship products, meet quality standards or source raw materials could materially impede its ability to satisfy customer demand and preserve operational continuity. To manage inventory volatility and respond to shifting consumer preferences, Nike employs a futures ordering program, actively adjusts inventory levels, and leverages closeout channels to balance supply and demand. Currency hedging through forward and option contracts and a centralized foreign exchange risk management program, including a sourcing-hub model that absorbs certain factory-input cost exposures, serve as financial resilience mechanisms to partially offset exchange rate fluctuations on product costs and reported results. In its management discussion, Nike emphasizes strategic initiatives to drive operational excellence—reducing product costs via manufacturing efficiency and design innovation, making its supply chain a competitive advantage, improving working capital efficiency, expanding direct-to-consumer capabilities and investing in information technology systems that underpin design, forecasting, manufacturing, retail and digital commerce—as deliberate efforts to sustain performance, adapt to rapid market changes and maintain positive outcomes under challenging economic and competitive conditions. The company underscores that new risk factors continuously emerge, that management cannot predict all such pressures or fully assess their combined impacts, and that it must therefore remain agile, proactive and prepared to deploy resources, reconfigure operations and respond to unforeseen events in order to preserve integrity and performance in line with its resilience objectives.

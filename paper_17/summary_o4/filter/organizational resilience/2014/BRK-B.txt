Berkshire’s board of directors has identified successor candidates for key leadership roles and continually monitors this risk, believing that “the board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units, helps to mitigate this risk,” thereby preserving continuity of decision-making and reducing organizational brittleness. The company’s “unusually decentralized business model,” with minimal involvement by corporate headquarters in day-to-day activities, fosters operational flexibility, knowledge absorption and rapid adaptation at subsidiary levels. To address cyber‐security, civil‐unrest and other disruptions, “we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis,” demonstrating preparedness and crisis management capabilities. Across insurance, railroad and utilities and energy segments, capital investments to expand network capacity and meet customer demand reflect ongoing reconfiguration of resources to maintain service levels after adverse external events. Berkshire maintains “extraordinary capital strength” and “ample liquidity,” preferring safety over yield for cash and cash equivalents, and uses a combination of operating cash flow and debt issuances to fund long-lived system assets, thereby preserving financial resilience under “internal or external variations and disturbances.” Regular scenario analyses of catastrophe exposures, insurance loss reserve assumptions and derivative valuations inform risk assessment and reserve provisioning for shifts in frequency, severity, legal environments or market volatility. In managing competitive pressures, the enterprise pursues “long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages,” while superior capital strength “creates opportunities … to enter into insurance and reinsurance contracts specially designed to meet the unique needs of buyers,” illustrating dynamic capability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

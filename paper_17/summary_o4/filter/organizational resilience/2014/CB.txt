The company relies on the dispersion of its share ownership and provisions in its organizational documents that limit voting power, together with other factors, to mitigate the risk that a U.S. person owning ten percent or more of its stock will be required to include its Subpart F income under the Controlled Foreign Corporation rules, thereby preserving its financial integrity under potential tax-related adversity, although it acknowledges that the Internal Revenue Service could challenge the effectiveness of these measures and that a court could sustain such a challenge, which could adversely affect the investment if such ownership thresholds are met.

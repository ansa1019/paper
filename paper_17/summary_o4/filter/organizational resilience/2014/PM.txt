The company maintains backup systems and business continuity plans to protect its information systems and data from unauthorized access, recognizing that failure of these systems or their penetration by external actors could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or sensitive data. It acknowledges that economic, political, regulatory or other developments, natural disasters or conflicts may disrupt its supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution channels, lead to loss of property or equipment critical to its business, and create difficulties in staffing and managing operations that could reduce volumes, revenues and earnings. To mitigate these risks and absorb strain under challenging conditions, the company has implemented restructuring measures including factory closures in the Netherlands, Australia and Canada with associated asset impairment and exit costs, and may replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with internal resources. Its forward-looking statements reflect prudent planning and assumptions, identify important risk factors that could materially affect outcomes, incorporate contingencies for incremental spending on reduced-risk products, and provide for revisiting share repurchase activities depending on currency and market conditions. In addition, the company applies rigorous control and compliance procedures and high ethical standards to prevent and detect unlawful conduct across its global operations, although it concedes the breadth of its operations may limit its ability to detect all improper conduct. These measures demonstrate the organizationâ€™s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve its functioning despite adverse internal and external pressures, reflecting its resilience as defined by its ability to maintain integrity and performance under variations and disturbances.

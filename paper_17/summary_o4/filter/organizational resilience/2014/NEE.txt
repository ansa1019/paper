The report describes a comprehensive framework of strategies and capabilities designed to absorb strain and maintain continuity under internal and external disturbances, including regulatory, operational and market risks.  The Company employs extensive risk mitigation mechanisms—such as derivative instruments for commodity and interest rate hedging, daily value‐at‐risk modeling, stop‐loss limits, master netting agreements and credit enhancement requirements—to manage volatility in fuel, power, gas and financial markets, as well as to safeguard liquidity under stressed credit conditions.  It maintains diversified sources of liquidity, including bank revolving credit facilities, project‐specific financings, capital commitments and insurance programs, to enable timely restoration of service following severe weather, cyber attacks, terrorist acts or other catastrophic events and to ensure funding for decommissioning obligations.  Regulatory deferral mechanisms and cost recovery clauses across retail base rates, nuclear cost recovery, fuel clause and storm‐recovery bonds provide a systemic perspective on resource allocation and organizational resilience by enabling the recovery of prudently incurred costs and investments in generation, transmission and distribution assets.  The Company’s enterprise‐wide cost savings initiative and continuous productivity improvements are intended to enhance operational flexibility and preserve performance under budgetary constraints, while targeted capital initiatives—including investments in modernized combined‐cycle plants, solar and wind capacity, long‐term gas supplies and natural gas pipeline systems—reflect a forward‐looking orientation toward adaptation, diversification and competitive advantage.  Maintenance of investment‐grade credit ratings, compliance with mandatory reliability standards and governance of risk exposures at all hierarchical levels underpin a resilient organizational structure capable of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, rapid reconstitution of operational trajectories and preservation of integrity across its regulated and non‐regulated businesses.

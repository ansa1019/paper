We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets, and, depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures, which involves the risk that we may not successfully identify suitable candidates or complete targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations; moreover, we face the risk that ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities, as we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources and our organizational structure could make it difficult to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations, and business combination and investment transactions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities and legal fees, such that if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives; our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges and it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge, maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our worldwide operations; accordingly, if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, and the possibility that employee misconduct—such as improper use of our clients’ sensitive or confidential information, failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information or inappropriate use of social networking sites—could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation underscores the need for robust internal controls, training and risk-mitigation measures to preserve functioning and performance under adverse or unexpected conditions.

The Company’s Risk Factors section emphasizes that “risks and uncertainties … could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections,” reflecting its focus on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The Company highlights that “our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in One Home Depot Supply Chain” and that its “failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins,” illustrating the need for resource allocation, operational flexibility and business continuity. It acknowledges that “intense competitive pressures … or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, could affect our prices, our margins, or demand for our products and services,” and that “we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process,” including the implementation of BOPIS, BODFS and direct fulfillment delivery options. The Company also notes that its “aging store base … requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire,” and that failure “to maintain our stores, utilize our store space effectively, and offer a safe shopping environment … could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share,” underscoring its emphasis on operational resilience and risk mitigation. In addition, the Company describes its heavy reliance on “information technology systems … to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data” which are “subject to damage or interruption from … cyber-attacks, catastrophic events … or design or usage errors,” and states that it “seeks to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems,” signifying ongoing adaptation and recovery mechanisms. The Risk Factors further address the potential for “disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise”—including weather-related events, trade policy changes, third-party strikes and capacity constraints—to “impair our ability to meet customer demand,” as well as the challenges of “maintaining the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information” amid “increasingly evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks,” all of which require dynamic capabilities, resilience strategies and continuous risk assessment. Finally, the Company outlines its need to manage external pressures such as legislative or regulatory changes in labor, healthcare, data protection and environmental matters, uncertainties arising from the Tax Act’s complex computations and interpretations, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and the integration of strategic transactions—each element illustrating its systemic perspective on preserving or improving functioning despite adversity.

In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, including comprehensive and conservative liquidity and funding policies to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances. Our most important liquidity policy is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash, and we maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress, which outlines our potential responses, identifies risk factors, defines key metrics, assigns responsibilities, and supports effective coordination of actions. Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including disruptions to communications, transportation or utilities, and notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, a catastrophic event affecting our primary locations could negatively affect our business if employees are unable to occupy offices, communicate or travel, hindering the implementation of contingency plans. We also seek to diversify our third-party vendors to increase our resiliency, and we stress-test our firmwide and subsidiary liquidity needs using both modeled liquidity outflows and intraday liquidity models, as well as long-term stress testing of market, credit and operational risks, to determine the appropriate size of our global core liquid assets, and we monitor limits set at firmwide, business and product levels to control our risk profile and preserve our financial stability under extreme conditions.

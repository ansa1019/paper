We conduct our operations in more than 35 countries and maintain diversified financing, including revolving credit and term-loan facilities and a substantial cash, cash-equivalent and marketable securities balance that we believe will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs and preserve operational continuity under adverse conditions.  We deploy foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of forecasted international sales and mitigate exposure to exchange-rate variability, while acknowledging that such hedges do not entirely eliminate currency risk.  We outsource a majority of our clinical trials to third-party contract research organizations and depend on a limited number of internal and external manufacturing sites that are subject to stringent good manufacturing practice requirements; we recognize that continuity of clinical development and product supply depends on rigorous quality controls, contingency planning for capacity constraints, and timely regulatory compliance.  Our business continuity planning addresses the potential for natural or man-made disasters—particularly in seismically active regions where key R&D and manufacturing facilities are located—and contemplates insurance, recovery-time objectives and logistics arrangements for products such as Yescarta, which require certified apheresis centers, specialized transportation, chain-of-identity and chain-of-custody protocols and a critical technology platform to ensure product integrity.  We have invested in information-technology infrastructure, security controls and monitoring to safeguard against cyberattacks, data breaches and service interruptions, recognizing that resilience of our systems and data underpins our ability to sustain clinical operations, manufacturing and global distribution.  Collectively, these measures reflect our capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite external pressures, reconfigure processes in response to unexpected events, allocate resources to maintain essential functions and enable recovery and future orientation under challenging conditions.

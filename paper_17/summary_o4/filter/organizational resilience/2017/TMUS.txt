Our 2017 Form 10-K discloses that we rely on resilient network systems and the systems of third-party providers to maintain operational continuity and protect sensitive customer and corporate information, and that system failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our networks, compromise data integrity or impair our ability to provide services, which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.  We acknowledge that cyber-attacks such as denial of service and other malicious attacks could disrupt our internal systems and applications, that our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever-evolving threat landscape, and that natural disasters, severe weather, hurricanes, political instability, acts of war or human error can cause physical damage, power surges or outages and equipment failure requiring remediation, insurance recoveries and claims for property damage and business interruption.  We describe our phased implementation of a new billing system and the need for operational flexibility, adaptation and risk mitigation to avoid unanticipated difficulties, delays or significant disruptions that could adversely affect our operational, financial and reputational performance.  We discuss our dependence on suppliers, contractors and other third parties under complex contractual commitments and transition plans designed to ensure continuity in the event of supplier failures or service degradation, including potential replacement on short notice.  We also address the challenges of spectrum scarcity, technological evolution and regulatory change as external pressures requiring strategic resource allocation, network build-out, innovation and reconfiguration of operating parameters to preserve network quality, customer retention and competitive positioning.  Finally, we outline our liquidity and financing arrangements, debt covenants, capital expenditure plans and spectrum auction commitments as elements of our financial resilience strategy to absorb strain under variable economic conditions, support major objectives and maintain performance under challenging and disruptive events.

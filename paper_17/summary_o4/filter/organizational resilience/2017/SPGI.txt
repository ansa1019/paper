S&P Global’s annual report emphasizes the critical importance of business continuity and disaster recovery planning to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions, noting that “our ability to continue to operate will depend…on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems” and warning that a disaster such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach or cyberattack “could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.” Management states that “we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession” and maintain disaster recovery plans including backup facilities for primary data centers, though it acknowledges that “our systems are not always fully redundant” and that “our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective.” The report describes risk‐mitigation mechanisms such as disciplined controls, compliance programs, lean management, robotics, automation and machine learning “to streamline internal workflow and deliver productivity” and underscores the need for operational flexibility and agility, noting that “unexpected challenges in execution” during integration of acquisitions “may require more management attention than expected,” diverting resources from other business issues. Cybersecurity and information security are highlighted as vital to resilience, with the firm acknowledging that “breaches of our or our vendors’ systems…and other security breaches may cause material interruptions or malfunctions…or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information,” and that evolving threats “may defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats,” any of which “could cause reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses.” To strengthen its capacity to adapt, the company is “enhancing planning and software engineering processes,” “strengthening our digital infrastructure capabilities, with emphasis on workplace services and cybersecurity,” “upholding our commitment to a disciplined and practical risk, control and compliance environment,” and fostering a performance culture that drives “innovation, flexibility and agility to address customer needs” through leadership development and skills training. Finally, the report identifies a wide array of external pressures—from regulatory reform, economic volatility, Brexit and fluctuating capital and commodity markets to evolving privacy laws—that require continuous innovation, strategic initiatives and resource reconfiguration to maintain integrity and performance in the face of uncertainty.

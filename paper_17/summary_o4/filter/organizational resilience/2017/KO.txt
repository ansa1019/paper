The Company’s Annual Report discloses a broad framework of risk identification and adaptive measures that collectively support its organizational resilience, defined as the maintenance of performance and integrity under challenging conditions. Management’s Discussion and Analysis outlines external pressures—including water scarcity, climate change, regulatory shifts, obesity concerns, currency volatility, inflation, political and economic instability—and describes systemic responses such as a formal Water Risk Management Program and Water Stewardship Strategic Framework executed locally through water‐use efficiency, wastewater treatment, shared watershed protection, community engagement and multi‐stakeholder partnerships that replenish resources. To mitigate supply‐chain and commodity hazards, the Company has implemented hedging programs for key inputs, maintains self‐insurance reserves supplemented by commercial insurance, and conducts continuous impairment and recoverability tests of assets and investments using assumptions aligned with hypothetical marketplace participants. Product and packaging innovation, diversified brand portfolios, transparent nutrition information and sustainable sourcing initiatives address shifting consumer needs and food‐security risks, while an Integrated Quality Management Program continually measures operations, identifies and mitigates risks, and drives improvement in product safety and quality. A Productivity and Reinvestment Program reconfigures resource allocation, standardizes data and information‐technology systems, optimizes the global supply chain, leverages cost savings into consumer-facing marketing investments and streamlines operating expenses to enhance strategic agility and long-term profitable growth. Franchise leadership initiatives emphasize aligned incentives, flexibility, rapid scale‐up and best-practice sharing with bottling partners, supporting organizational change processes and operational continuity in volatile markets. Financial resilience is further underpinned by diversified access to global capital markets through commercial paper and long-term debt issuances, active currency management to offset translation impacts, rigorous pension and postretirement valuation using updated actuarial assumptions, and careful management of tax contingencies and hyperinflationary currency remeasurements, all of which contribute to the firm’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity.

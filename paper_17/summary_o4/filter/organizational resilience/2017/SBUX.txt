Starbucks acknowledges that its operations must function under conditions of uncertainty and rapid change, noting that “new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations” and that the occurrence of any listed risk could materially and adversely affect the company’s business and financial condition. The company recognizes the potential for “interruption of our supply chain” due to events ranging from “casualty loss of any of our roasting plants” to “trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, or natural disasters,” any of which could impede its ability “to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.” Likewise, Starbucks “relies heavily on information technology in our operations,” and acknowledges that any “material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology”—whether caused by “power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third party software or services, errors by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in security”—could harm operational continuity and financial results. In response, the company has established “operational safeguards” and “incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans,” and continues to “make significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches,” while acknowledging that such measures “cannot provide assurance” against all future failures or data loss. In its management discussion, Starbucks emphasizes the importance of maintaining the “reliability, integrity and capacity” of interdependent IT systems to support digital initiatives and supply chain operations, and outlines a financial resilience strategy in which it “actively manages our cash and investments” to “internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments,” execute strategic acquisitions, and return capital through dividends and share repurchases, asserting that future cash flows and the “ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements” for core and developing businesses.

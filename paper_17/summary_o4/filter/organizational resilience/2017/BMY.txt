Our risk disclosures emphasize the importance of maintaining operational continuity and adapting to disruptions, noting, for example, that “losing key molecules and intermediaries or our compound library through a natural or man-made disaster or act of sabotage could negatively impact the product development cycle,” and that “the failure of any critical third party to meet its obligations, including … adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results.” We acknowledge that our “manufacturing and commercial operations in Puerto Rico were impacted by the recent hurricanes,” with sites now operating at reduced capacity while we “continue to work to restore to normal operations,” illustrating our ongoing recovery efforts and resource reallocation under challenging conditions. To preserve supply chain integrity, we maintain detailed distribution-service agreements with major wholesalers and have “established a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns” to limit inventory to expected demand. Our information-technology and cybersecurity practices include “investing in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices,” continuous threat monitoring, and maintaining cyber insurance, reflecting a systemic perspective on risk mitigation and resilience strategies. From a financial resilience standpoint, management “continuously evaluates the company’s capital structure to ensure the company is financed efficiently,” employing commercial paper and revolving credit facilities to secure liquidity, while “we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations … will be sufficient to satisfy our normal cash requirements” over the next few years. Finally, our “operating model transformation” focuses on “investment in commercial opportunities against key brands and markets, accelerate the pipeline, streamline operations and realign manufacturing capabilities that broaden biologics capabilities,” thereby enhancing our organizational agility, strategic flexibility, and capacity to maintain performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

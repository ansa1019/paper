The company recognizes that its ability to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions depends on factors such as the attractiveness of its compensation and benefit programs, global economic, political and industry conditions, its organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and its ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment; accordingly, it periodically evaluates its overall compensation and benefit programs and makes adjustments as appropriate to maintain or enhance their competitiveness, because failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees could prevent the company from capitalizing on market opportunities and materially and adversely affect its operating results.

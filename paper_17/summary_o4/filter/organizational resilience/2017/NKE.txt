Nike’s disclosures recognize that “business disruptions” including climate change, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict may interrupt manufacturing, supply chain and distribution; our global distribution facilities and “information technology systems” are exposed to failures, security breaches and extreme weather conditions that may “impede” operations despite “business interruption insurance.” We employ a “futures ordering program” that allows retailers to place orders five to six months in advance, enabling us to “minimize inventory, purchasing costs, fill time and risk of non-delivery,” while also addressing “inventory shortages” and “excess inventories” through off-price channels and merchandising strategies. A centrally managed foreign currency adjustment program, together with forward contracts and options, seeks to “lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations,” and our committed credit facility and commercial paper program provide liquidity under volatile capital markets. Our strategy to enhance “manufacturing efficiency, product design and innovation” and to invest in “new technologies that increase automation, reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market” supports operational flexibility and adaptation to shifting consumer preferences across digital commerce and direct-to-consumer channels. Research and development investments with specialists across biomechanics, chemistry, engineering and design underpin “technical innovation” and enable our ability to respond to market volatility. We maintain a concentrated base of contract manufacturers and contingency planning for raw material supply, transportation disruptions and commodity cost swings. Additionally, risk management practices extend to intellectual property protection, legal and compliance proceedings, tax planning and hedging of cash flows, reflecting a systemic approach to preserving integrity and performance while under external pressures and constraints.

Throughout the Annual Report, the company recognizes that unexpected adverse events such as oil price shocks, stock market volatility, terrorist attacks, extreme weather, natural disasters, health pandemics and political instability can disrupt travel demand and dramatically affect consumer behavior, and it acknowledges that these unforeseen events are largely unpredictable and can materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, requiring business continuity and risk mitigation measures. The company notes that system capacity constraints, failures or denial-of-service attacks, phishing and other security breaches could severely impair its online platforms, disrupt service for consumers and travel service providers, damage its reputation and brands, and result in loss of business, and although it maintains redundant systems and hosting services and expends significant resources to protect its infrastructure, it does not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to cover all potential losses and lacks a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every region, which could prolong recovery times and expose it to further operational strain. To support its growth from approximately 6,900 to 22,900 employees and ongoing international expansion, the company has invested substantially in marketing, technology and personnel, adjusting performance advertising spend to balance growth and profitability objectives and continually innovating its websites and mobile platforms, yet it acknowledges that increased complexity places additional strain on management, operations, technical performance and internal controls. The company further observes that legal, regulatory and tax requirements across multiple jurisdictions are evolving and potentially conflicting, which increases compliance costs, may delay or prevent strategic initiatives such as acquisitions, and could materially disrupt its operations if it fails to adapt. Finally, the report highlights the reliance on third-party providers, including cloud services, distribution channels and global distribution systems, whose performance or failure could likewise impede bookings and necessitate robust resilience strategies to maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

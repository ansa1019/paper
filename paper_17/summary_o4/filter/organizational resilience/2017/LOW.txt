We have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business, and our framework, administered by our chief financial officer, includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify. We may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits, demands and demographics of our customers, or realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives, and our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to economic, social, style and other trends, implement change, growth, and productivity initiatives, and deliver large, complex programs requiring more integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing. These initiatives will require new competencies in many positions, and our management, employees and contractors will have to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities; to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access. Our customer-facing technology systems must function as designed, provide a consistent customer experience and, without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, performance issues—whether from distributed denial of service, ransomware or other cyber-attacks, power outages or catastrophic events—could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide and interrupt our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied. In order to maintain compliance with evolving data privacy and cybersecurity laws, we may sustain increased costs to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements, and a security breach could materially increase our costs, disrupt operations and damage our reputation. We rely on a combination of internal controls and integration of businesses into our financial systems to provide reliable and accurate financial reports; the complexity arising from strategic transactions—including our acquisition of RONA and Maintenance Supply Headquarters—and our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully, while avoiding disruption of ongoing operations and management distraction, is subject to uncertainties and may materially reduce our earnings if not effectively managed. Our supply chain, whether domestic or international, is critical to operations and is vulnerable to trade policy changes, political instability, labor unrest, natural disasters, pandemics and other disruptions that could delay delivery, increase costs, cause out-of-stocks and lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence. We use third-party installers under regulatory requirements and, as general contractor, any failure to manage permits, licensing or quality could result in lost sales, fines, lawsuits and reputation damage. Our omni-channel strategy depends on ongoing investment in, maintenance of and improvements to our management information systems across sales, inventory replenishment, ordering, designing, fulfillment and transportation; catastrophic events, viruses, malicious attacks or telecommunications failures could cause significant expense, data loss and erosion of customer confidence. Our ability to hire, train, manage and retain qualified associates and specialists with expanded skill sets and to manage leadership transitions, notably the planned retirement of our chief executive officer, is critical to operational continuity and organizational health; failure to do so could disrupt relationships with customers, suppliers, vendors and employees and limit our capacity to implement strategic priorities. We expect our strong credit ratings, efficient short-term and long-term borrowing facilities and cash flows from operations to continue providing adequate liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures and strategic investments, but disruption in financial markets or erosion of credit strength could negatively impact our ability to access capital. Finally, positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is vital to maintaining trust among customers, vendors and employees, and adverse publicity or negative incidents can rapidly erode confidence and undermine our organizational resilience and long-term performance.

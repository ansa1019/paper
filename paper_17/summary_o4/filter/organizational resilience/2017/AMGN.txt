In our disclosures we describe how we maintained product supply and operations under exceptionally adverse conditions, including resuming full biopharmaceutical manufacturing at our Puerto Rico facility following Hurricane Maria by operating on back-up diesel generators, arranging pre-contracted fuel deliveries and sourcing medical-grade gases from the U.S. mainland and abroad, while recognizing that further disruptions to power, infrastructure, critical staff availability or logistics could materially impair our ability to supply medicines. We acknowledge reliance on proprietary raw materials, medical devices and components from unaffiliated sole‐source suppliers and the attendant risks of supplier insolvency, quality failures, contamination, shortages, labor disputes, regulatory restrictions and natural disasters, and describe our use of regulatory approval processes and alternate sourcing arrangements to mitigate those risks. We detail the necessity of uninterrupted, efficient operations at our primary distribution centers in Louisville and Breda and our third-party logistics providers, noting that natural disasters or security threats to transportation networks could delay product delivery. We outline our ongoing “transformation and process improvement” efforts to establish a more agile, efficient operating model, underpinned by a restructuring plan that has generated approximately $1.5 billion of savings to date while funding global product launches and R&D investments. We disclose investments in next-generation biomanufacturing technology—dramatically reducing scale and cost yet preserving high‐quality, compliant supply—and the successful commercial approval of our Singapore facility. We discuss our approach to financial resilience, including a significant portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities, a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program and interest-rate and cross-currency hedges to manage liquidity, interest rate and currency risks, and confirm that strong operating cash flow supports working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, repurchases and strategic transactions. We detail risk assessment and mitigation in areas of regulatory compliance, pricing and reimbursement uncertainties, complex government reporting requirements, intellectual property challenges, product liability and government investigations, plus tax contingencies including aggressive audits, uncertain interpretations of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, recognition of a repatriation tax payable over eight years and remeasurement of deferred tax balances, all of which illustrate our systematic efforts to preserve organizational integrity, maintain partial performance under internal and external disturbances, and adapt effectively to evolving pressures.

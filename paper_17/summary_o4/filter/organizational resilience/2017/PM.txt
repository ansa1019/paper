The company discloses that economic, political, regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt its supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution networks and lead to loss of critical property or equipment, staffing and management difficulties and reductions in volume, revenues and net earnings, underscoring the need for operational flexibility and business continuity. It maintains backup systems and business continuity plans to protect systems and data from unauthorized access, while acknowledging that system failures or security breaches could result in business disruption, revenue and asset loss, reputational damage, regulatory actions and significant remediation costs, reflecting an emphasis on risk mitigation and system resilience. To address shifting consumer preferences and market volatility, the company recognizes the importance of promoting brand equity, developing new products and markets, broadening its brand portfolio, improving productivity and ensuring adequate production capacity, noting that down-trading trends and regulatory constraints on branding and product differentiation may adversely affect product mix and profitability, which highlights its strategic agility and adaptability. Its growth strategy through selective acquisitions and strategic business relationships carries risks of integration failure and unmet revenue and cost-saving objectives, illustrating resource allocation challenges and inter-organizational collaboration efforts. In pursuit of its transformation toward smoke-free products, the company focuses on developing and commercializing reduced-risk products supported by rigorous scientific substantiation and on advocating science-based regulatory frameworks, demonstrating an innovation-driven and future-oriented resilience strategy. The disclosures also address currency risks, noting that strengthening of the U.S. dollar or local currency devaluations may impair competitiveness and necessitate strategic responses that balance volume and margin objectives. Finally, the company acknowledges that replacing third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with internal resources, if necessary, could significantly increase costs, indicating proactive resource reconfiguration and contingency planning. Collectively, these disclosures convey the organizationâ€™s capacity to absorb strain, mitigate risks, adapt strategic and operational processes and preserve functioning in the face of internal and external variations and disturbances.

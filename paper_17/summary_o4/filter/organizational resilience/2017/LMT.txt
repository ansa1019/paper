Lockheed Martin’s 10-K underscores its structured approach to anticipating and weathering disruptions by continuously identifying, managing and mitigating risks that could materially affect its operating results or cash flows, including government funding uncertainties and contract terminations, and by actively shaping its portfolio through disciplined acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to align resources with strategic priorities. The company operates under long-term, multi-year programs with percentage-of-completion accounting that demand ongoing reassessment of technical, schedule and cost risks, while recognizing profits as positive adjustments upon successful risk retirements. It maintains diversified operations across four business segments—Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems and Space—and fosters operational flexibility through concurrent development and production on complex programs such as the F-35 to accelerate fielding and mitigate brittleness. To adapt to external pressures, Lockheed Martin relies on robust backlog management, competing for follow-on awards, converting cost recoveries into advance payments, and preserving liquidity via a revolving credit facility and commercial paper to fund working capital and defined benefit plan contributions. The company emphasizes program execution, affordability initiatives and strong customer relationships to sustain performance under pressure, invests in cybersecurity and enterprise risk management to defend against evolving threats, and allocates capital to independent R&D, selective acquisitions, and internal projects—all reflecting an organizational capability to absorb strain, preserve critical functions and reconfigure its business in the face of legislative, budgetary and market perturbations.

Our disclosures describe numerous measures and processes that support organizational resilience, defined as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  We maintain business continuity plans and invest in operational flexibility and supply chain optimizations to address risks such as natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, political volatility, labor market disruptions and other crises or hazards over which we have no control, which could interrupt product supply, cause operational outages or impair critical manufacturing and sole‐supplier arrangements.  We engage in rigorous risk mitigation through inter‐organizational collaboration with third parties, standardized policies and procedures for contract management, governance and compliance, and hedging and derivative strategies to manage foreign currency, commodity and interest rate exposures, thereby preserving financial resources and system integrity.  Our ongoing productivity and cost savings initiative, including targeted restructuring and streamlined management decision making, is designed to deliver manufacturing cost savings, reconfigure resources, reinvest in product and packaging innovations and strengthen organizational effectiveness.  We rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and cybersecurity measures—including network monitoring, employee security training and updated security policies—to safeguard data, deploy recovery mechanisms and ensure rapid remediation under advanced persistent threats or other disruptions.  Our global organizational structure of business units, selling and market operations and centralized services enables agile responses to environmental perturbations, currency controls and regulatory changes, as evidenced by our deconsolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries in response to exchange restrictions, and supports the preservation or enhancement of performance, liquidity and system resilience amid internal or external variations and disturbances.

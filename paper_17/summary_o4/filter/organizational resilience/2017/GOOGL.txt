The Company acknowledges that its operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, requiring robust risk assessment and mitigation strategies. It faces intense competition, rapidly evolving technologies, shifting user needs and regulatory pressures that demand continuous investment in research and development, acquisitions and resource allocation to enhance technology, deliver innovative and relevant products and maintain competitive advantage. The Company anticipates pressure on operating margins from changes in device and geographic mix, increased reliance on non-advertising and programmatic advertising revenues, and investments in newer “other bets” ventures, underscoring the need for strategic resource deployment and portfolio reconfiguration. Significant capital and human resources are committed to maintaining state-of-the-art information technology and communications infrastructure, data centers and security protections to safeguard against cyber attacks, system failures, natural disasters and other disruptions; however, some systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Financial resilience is supported by a substantial cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities position, a revolving credit facility and foreign currency hedging programs to offset exchange-rate volatility. The Company’s holding company structure relies on the operational performance and cash flows of its subsidiaries and is intended to increase management scale while enabling diverse business units to operate autonomously. It recognizes the importance of human capital and corporate culture in fostering innovation, adaptability and organizational health, while acknowledging challenges in talent retention, integration of acquisitions, supply-chain dependencies, intellectual property protection and compliance with complex global laws. Seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in user behavior and advertising demand further underscore the Company’s need for operational flexibility and proactive strategic planning to preserve its functioning and performance in the face of internal and external disturbances.

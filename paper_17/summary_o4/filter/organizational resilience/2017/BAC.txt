The annual report repeatedly emphasizes the firm’s comprehensive risk management and business continuity infrastructure, noting that “we are exposed to a variety of risks … for more information on how we manage risks, see managing risk in the MD&A,” and describing a structured “risk framework” with clear roles, responsibilities and accountability across three lines of defense—front‐line units, independent risk management and corporate audit—supported by the Management Risk Committee and board oversight to “identify, measure, monitor and control risk” in a forward‐looking manner.  It highlights a liquidity management program that maintains “global liquidity sources … comprised of assets that are readily available,” backed by contingency funding plans, scenario‐based stress analysis and “operational procedures to borrow against” eligible collateral, all designed to “enable us to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs.”  The report details capital scenario management, stress forecasting and a capital contingency and recovery plan to ensure capital adequacy under adverse conditions, as well as a “resolution plan” and “single point of entry strategy” to preserve the firm’s operating subsidiaries in crisis.  It describes ongoing investments in system resilience—“backup systems and other safeguards”—and continuous updates to technology, controls and cyber‐security measures to address breaches or operational failures, acknowledging that “cyber threats are rapidly evolving” and that third‐party dependencies also introduce risk.  The firm also maintains systematic processes for regulatory and compliance risk, model risk oversight, and reputational risk assessment, and uses quantitative techniques, including VAR and credit and market stress tests, to gauge potential losses across its mortgage, trading and banking book activities.  In addition, it stresses proactive credit and operational strategies—from contingency planning and liquidity buffers to hedging programs and capital allocation—to mitigate the effects of market disruptions, maintain integrity and performance under pressure, and support adaptive, resilient operations.

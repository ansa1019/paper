Our risk disclosures emphasize the need to preserve operational integrity and maintain business continuity under a wide range of internal and external pressures, including economic downturns, credit-market disruptions, evolving healthcare legislation, competitive dynamics, regulatory changes, and unforeseen events such as natural disasters, epidemics, or cyber threats. We recognize that sustaining performance requires vigilant resource allocation and flexibility in manufacturing and supply‐chain processes to address sole‐source supplier risks, component shortages, and production backlogs, and to manage receivables, inventory levels, and service requirements. To mitigate these risks, we employ insurance and self‐insurance programs for product liability, foreign‐currency hedging strategies, stringent quality and compliance systems, contingency planning for information‐security incidents, and periodic reviews of legal and tax positions. We continue to invest in research and development and strategic collaborations to diversify our portfolio and enhance adaptability, while relying on strong cash flows, liquidity, and financial reserves to support strategic initiatives, satisfy contractual obligations, and reconfigure resources as needed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in challenging conditions.

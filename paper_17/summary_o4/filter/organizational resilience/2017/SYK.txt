The Company’s 2017 Form 10-K discloses a comprehensive suite of risk mitigation, resource allocation and operational continuity measures that collectively support its ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  It describes a global cash management strategy that leverages operating cash flow, derivative hedging for currency fluctuations and disciplined capital deployment—prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—to preserve financial flexibility and firm performance amid market volatility.  The report details extensive compliance programs, periodic regulatory inspections and legal risk management for product liability and intellectual property litigation, reflecting a systemic perspective on preserving organizational integrity despite evolving external pressures.  Supply chain resilience is underscored by identification of sole-source raw materials subject to FDA validation, contingency planning for natural disasters, equipment breakdowns or internal protocol failures, and a swift in-house manufacturing shift following a third-party supplier recall to restore full supply capacity.  Investments in information technology continuity and cybersecurity—encompassing network monitoring, expert staffing, employee training and business continuity plans—illustrate the organization’s preparedness to withstand and recover from system disruptions or security breaches.  The ongoing global ERP implementation and associated change management efforts demonstrate proactive reconfiguration of operating parameters to enhance adaptability and operational flexibility.  Management’s discussion of large-scale acquisitions, capital expenditures in new technologies and plants, and non-GAAP measures for analyzing core operating trends further evidences the firm’s dynamic capabilities for resource reconfiguration, learning and strategic foresight.  Finally, the establishment of reserves for voluntary product recalls, uncertain income tax positions and underfunded pension plans reflects a robust approach to impact assessment, scenario planning and resilience engineering under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

The Company reports that “rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years … has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure,” requiring it “to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems.”  It acknowledges that “we may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner,” and that “our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud,” warning that failure “to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner, may result in disruption of our current operations and end-customer relationships, our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses.”  The Company further states that it “has encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries, including the risks described elsewhere in this annual report,” and discloses that its “reliance on component suppliers … could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers,” that it “depends on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines … which exposes us to risk,” and that “product quality problems, defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”  The Company warns that “continuing or worsening economic instability could adversely affect spending for IT, network infrastructure, systems and tools,” and that “breaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers, delay our ability to recognize revenue, compromise the integrity of our software products, result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property, damage our reputation, expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data.”

The company maintains an enterprise risk management framework approved by the board of directors and supported by a global risk committee and functional sub-committees that oversee risk identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring and mitigation across operational, compliance, financial, credit, market and liquidity risk categories. Policies and procedures govern operational risk through periodic self-assessments, control testing, internal audit reviews and insurance programs designed to address key risks and preserve business functioning under system interruptions, cyber attacks, third-party failures and other disruptions, while business continuity and disaster recovery plans, geographically dispersed backup and recovery infrastructure, routine testing and role-based data security controls ensure rapid restoration of critical functions. The information security program combines technical and organizational measures, employee training and continuous monitoring to detect and remediate unauthorized access or threats. Governance of model risk, fiduciary risk and compliance risk is effected through dedicated committees, documented policies, standardized approval processes, centralized model registries with risk ratings, and ongoing testing to maintain integrity of decision-making under changing conditions. The firm’s asset-liability management policies actively manage interest rate sensitivity and net interest margin by adjusting the duration and repricing of interest-earning assets and liabilities, and sensitivity to market shifts is evaluated through net interest revenue simulation models subject to defined risk limits and breach remediation plans. Liquidity is supported by internally generated and diversified funding sources, overnight and highly liquid investments, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, periodic liquidity stress tests, early-warning indicators and contingency funding scenarios to preserve operational continuity in both normal and stressed environments. Capital is managed through internal guidelines, monthly forecasts, early-warning indicators, subsidiary dividend and infusion policies and comprehensive stress testing—including scenarios of extreme cash inflows and outflows—to ensure that regulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios remain well in excess of minimum requirements at both holding company and bank levels, thereby enabling the organization to absorb losses, reconfigure resources, preserve integrity and emerge stronger from adverse events.

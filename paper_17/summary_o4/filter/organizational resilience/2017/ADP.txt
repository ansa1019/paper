The company discloses that it routinely encounters and addresses a wide range of internal and external risks and relies heavily on robust payroll, financial, accounting and data‐processing systems to sustain operational continuity, noting that any systems failure—even briefly—could result in financial loss, business disruption, client and regulatory impacts or reputational harm. It maintains programs to prevent, detect and respond to data‐security incidents, devoting significant resources to safeguard and regularly update its systems and processes against evolving cyber-attack techniques while acknowledging that these measures may prove insufficient to prevent all breaches. Disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis-management plans are in place to protect against events including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions and power or communication failures, although the company recognizes that despite these preparations, they may not fully prevent or mitigate loss of client data, service interruptions, operational disruptions or damage to facilities. To ensure liquidity and mitigate financial volatility, the company invests client funds in diversified, investment-grade marketable securities with staggered maturities, employs short-term financing arrangements including commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements and maintains committed credit facilities, thereby averaging its way through interest-rate cycles and preserving the ability to meet obligations to clients. The company continuously reviews, upgrades and enhances compliance policies, procedures and service-alignment initiatives—such as platform upgrades from legacy systems to cloud-based solutions and adjustments in its service organization—to adapt to changing client needs, regulatory complexity and operational pressures. It monitors dependencies on both company-run and third-party data centers, recognizing that any vendor’s failure or service termination could disrupt operations and incur material costs. Through substantial investments in system updates, strategic platform enhancements, liquidity management and crisis-management procedures, the company seeks to absorb strain, preserve its integrity and maintain or improve functioning despite internal or external disturbances, reflecting a systemic approach to organizational resilience.

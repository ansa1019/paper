The Company’s disclosures reflect an integrated view of organizational resilience as the capacity to anticipate, absorb, adapt to and recover from a wide range of internal and external disruptions. In its business resiliency risk discussion, management warns that failure to recover from disasters or continuity events—ranging from natural catastrophes, power or telecommunications failures, pandemics and cyber-attacks to terrorist incidents—could materially disrupt operations by impairing the availability of personnel, office facilities and critical IT and telecommunications systems, causing data loss, service interruptions and financial, regulatory, reputational and legal consequences that business disruption insurance may not fully cover, and therefore the Company regularly assesses and enhances its business continuity plans and key management succession arrangements. The cybersecurity and data protection section further underscores the need for uninterrupted and secure IT operations, highlights vulnerabilities in legacy systems, patching processes and access controls, notes the growing sophistication of external and internal threats and the operational risks posed by third-party vendors with system access, and acknowledges that inadequate safeguards, delayed detection or remediation of breaches, or insufficient insurance coverage could lead to substantial harm. Competitive risk disclosures emphasize the necessity to foresee and respond to digital disruption and technological change through ongoing investments in technology systems, service innovation and strategic initiatives, while regulatory and legal risk sections describe the pressures of extensive, evolving multi-jurisdictional compliance obligations that may impose operational limitations, divert resources and require agile risk mitigation and governance frameworks. Additionally, the Company details its use of case-level reviews and actuarial analyses to estimate errors and omissions liabilities, and cautions that the complexity of integrating acquired businesses, valuing goodwill and managing contingent liabilities may create further challenges to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

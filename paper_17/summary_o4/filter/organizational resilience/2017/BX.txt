In its risk disclosures the registrant underscores the potential for operational disruptions—from cybersecurity breaches to infrastructure failures—to undermine its ability to “operate our business without interruption” and candidly acknowledges that “our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient to mitigate harm” arising from such events. The report further describes the deployment of financial and derivative instruments “to limit our exposure to market risks,” the use of gating provisions to suspend fund redemptions and the allocation of capital “to provide for the growth of our existing businesses,” all of which reflect mechanisms to sustain performance under adverse conditions. It highlights the dependence of its funds’ portfolio companies on the “availability of credit” in “difficult market conditions” and the necessity to “adapt to changing market conditions,” “reconfigure strategies” in response to economic turbulence and manage resource constraints under “extreme conditions.” Human capital and culture are framed as critical assets for maintaining competitive advantage and “alignment of interests with investors,” with incentives structured to preserve internal knowledge and practitioner retention even if performance deteriorates. Overall, the firm’s extensive discussion of risk management, contingency planning, counterparty diversification and governance processes implicitly reflects a systemic approach to preserving integrity and performance under internal and external perturbations, consistent with the broad concept of organizational resilience.

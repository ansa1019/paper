Management acknowledges that as a global company it is “subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries,” noting that “disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition,” including the value of properties, availability of financing, debt service and customers’ leasing performance; to mitigate system failures or cyber security attacks, it has implemented “system redundancy, security measures and … a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems,” though operations remain “vulnerable to damages from any number of sources” and may incur “additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions”; management “continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting” to address “deficiencies” that could lead to “errors, misstatements or misrepresentations”; the Company “generally seeks to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio, market research and our asset management capabilities” and evaluates its earthquake, hurricane and flood insurance “annually in light of current industry practice,” electing self-insurance “when commercially reasonable”; it maintains property damage, rental loss, environmental and terrorism insurance “subject to coverage limitations and deductibles” and recognizes that uninsured or underinsured losses could materially impair both invested capital and future revenues; the organization attempts to mitigate adverse effects by “borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts,” while acknowledging these strategies may not fully limit exposure; liquidity is managed through operating cash flows, distributions from co-investment ventures, property dispositions and a credit facility with $3.1 billion available, which management considers “adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements”; asset carrying values are evaluated “whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable,” measured against estimated undiscounted future cash flows, with impairments recognized as necessary; costs incurred in renovating, rehabilitating and improving operating properties, including interest, insurance, real estate taxes and certain G&A costs, are capitalized to prepare assets for their “intended use”; and strategic planning encompasses evaluation of market conditions, liquidity needs and other factors to ensure the Company’s ability to adapt its portfolio and resource deployment under nominal, extreme or exceptional pressures.

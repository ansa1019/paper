Our operations rely heavily on robust information and operational systems and on third-party service providers, and any failure, disablement or breach of our financial, accounting, data processing or technology infrastructure—whether through cyber-security incidents, disasters affecting our principal offices or other disruptions—could cause financial loss, regulatory intervention, liability to our funds, reputational damage and interruption of our services. Although we maintain business continuation and disaster recovery programs and insurance and other safeguards, these measures may prove insufficient to address harm arising from internal or external disturbances and may not fully offset losses or prevent adverse impacts on our liquidity, operations or ability to support fund investors. We endeavor to mitigate known risks to the extent practicable and reasonable, but provide no assurance that our risk-mitigation strategies, continuity plans, resource allocations, crisis response or technology infrastructure will preserve system integrity, maintain critical functions under challenging conditions or enable a positive adjustment in the face of unexpected events or extreme conditions.

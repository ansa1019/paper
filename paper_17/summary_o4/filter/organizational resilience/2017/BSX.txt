The annual report discloses that the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by intense competition, rapid technological change, market consolidation, pricing pressures and evolving reimbursement and regulatory requirements, requiring continued allocation of resources to research and development, manufacturing, quality systems and compliance processes to sustain operational continuity and preserve performance under challenging conditions. Management monitors global economic volatility, credit and sovereign debt issues that could disrupt suppliers’ and customers’ liquidity and impair its ability to produce and market products, underscoring the need for supply-chain resilience and contingency planning. The Company describes its reliance on concentrated manufacturing sites and third-party sterilization providers, any interruption of which could delay production, lead to regulatory approvals delays and erode market share. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining robust internal controls over financial reporting, managing debt levels to preserve investment-grade credit ratings and safeguarding cash flows to ensure access to liquidity and fund strategic initiatives. The report details efforts to integrate and realign acquired businesses through restructuring and optimization initiatives designed to enhance growth potential, simplify plant networks, improve cost efficiency and reinvest savings in strategic growth projects, reflecting adaptive strategies and organizational reconfiguration. It also addresses the vulnerability of its information technology systems to cyber-attacks, mandating ongoing investments to protect data integrity and confidentiality. The Company further notes that extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, potential product liability and litigation exposures and changes in tax legislation may require significant process improvements, reserve accruals and strategic responses to maintain regulatory compliance, mitigate risks and uphold organizational integrity in the face of external pressures.

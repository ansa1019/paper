We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks driven by factors beyond our control or prediction, and our success depends on our ability to anticipate and manage these difficulties through continual development of new products and services, integration of acquired technologies, enhancement of existing offerings and dynamic reconfiguration of resources to meet evolving customer needs.  We have placed strategic emphasis on growing our cloud‐based software as a service, platform as a service and infrastructure as a service revenues, refreshing and releasing new and enhanced products within expected time frames, optimizing complementary product lines, and integrating acquired product lines and services, all to preserve or improve our functioning under environmental perturbations such as rapid technological advances, changing delivery models, evolving industry standards, sophisticated customer requirements and shifts in general economic, political or budgetary conditions.  We have invested heavily in maintaining the integrity, security and reliability of our products, services and data, including infrastructure and marketing expenses incurred in advance of revenue recognition, to guard against external disturbances such as cyber‐attacks, security breaches, nation‐state espionage, natural disasters, public health crises, climate‐related hazards and supply chain disruptions, thereby supporting business continuity, operational flexibility and crisis response.  Our operations include comprehensive risk assessment, emergency management and regulatory compliance processes to mitigate potential liabilities arising from errors, coding or configuration defects, privacy or data protection regulations, anti‐competition and export requirements, and conflict minerals disclosure, while our workforce restructuring initiatives, talent retention programs and compensation practices seek to sustain organizational health and adaptability.  We utilize a hybrid deployment model, including our Cloud at Customer program, to enable customers to evolve and manage on‐premise and cloud instances interchangeably, reflecting our systemic perspective on maintaining partial performance and integrity under both nominal and extreme conditions.  Our selective and active acquisition program funds targeted transactions to expand our competitive advantage, accelerate innovation trajectories, reconstitute temporal response trajectories to disruptive events, and reconfigure our capabilities toward future growth, all while maintaining robust governance over supply commitments, manufacturing partnerships and third‐party channel networks to safeguard continuity and resiliency across hierarchical levels and geographic regions.

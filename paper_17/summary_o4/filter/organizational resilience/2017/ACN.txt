In the event of acquisitions or joint ventures, we face risks that ongoing business may be disrupted and management’s attention diverted by acquisition, investment, transition or integration activities, requiring us to dedicate additional management and other resources; our organizational structure could make it difficult to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees, potentially impeding our ability to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. We may have difficulties entering new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions, and if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size and scale—including maintaining effective standards across a large enterprise, effectively institutionalizing our knowledge, managing and monitoring personnel and operations worldwide, and communicating our culture, core values, policies, procedures, strategies and goals—our ability to compete successfully, maintain business continuity and achieve our major objectives could be impaired. In addition, from time to time we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model and organizational structure as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement these changes, our organizational health, operational flexibility and ongoing performance could be negatively impacted.

The company acknowledges that disruption, degradation or manipulation of its complex information technology systems could impact key business processes and that the June 27, 2017 network cyber-attack led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations; nonetheless, throughout this time Merck continued to fulfill orders and ship product, all manufacturing sites are now operational and the company did not expect a significant impairment to the value of intangible assets, having borrowed doses of Gardasil 9 from the CDC pediatric vaccine stockpile to address residual inventory backlogs and higher-than-anticipated demand, subsequently replenishing a portion of those doses in 2017 and anticipating full replenishment in 2018; the company’s response also included recording manufacturing-related and remediation expenses net of insurance recoveries and pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to enhance the company’s resiliency against future cyber-attacks—including measures “not only to protect against future cyber-attacks, but also to improve the speed of the company’s recovery from such attacks and enable continued business operations to the greatest extent possible during any recovery period”; similarly, when Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico the company’s plant sustained minimal damage, production activities resumed, alternative power and water sources are in place and supply chains are improving to restore normal operations; Merck continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes—while recognizing that doing so can create new risks—and maintains insurance coverage against cyber-attack costs, actively monitors its data, IT and personnel usage, and depends on third parties for key aspects of its business, where failure of such third parties to meet contractual, regulatory or quality obligations could materially impair business continuity, product supply and reputational strength.

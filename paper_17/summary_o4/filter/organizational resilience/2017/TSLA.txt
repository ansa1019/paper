Tesla’s disclosures underscore its need to “maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions” through continuous reconfiguration of its production and supply chain, noting that it “may experience delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch and production ramp of new vehicles and other products,” driven by “unanticipated challenges, such as certain supply chain constraints,” “bottlenecks in the production of Model 3,” reliance on “single source suppliers” and “unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing, labor issues, wars, governmental changes, natural disasters such as the March 2011 earthquakes in Japan and other factors beyond our and our suppliers’ control,” any of which “could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.”  The company describes resilience strategies including significant “investments of cash and management resources” to expand Gigafactory 1 and 2, the use of a “higher degree of automation in our materials conveyance, battery module production and other manufacturing processes,” and the redeployment of “our best engineering talent” to “fine-tune our manufacturing lines” and resolve “production bottlenecks.”  It emphasizes the criticality of operational flexibility and systemic adaptation—“to manage our expansion and growth successfully,” by establishing “sufficient worldwide automobile sales, delivery, service and supercharger facilities,” adapting products and operations to comply with “complex or conflicting regulations,” and securing skilled personnel globally—to preserve organizational functioning, mitigate risks of disruptive events and extreme conditions, and sustain performance, competitive advantage and business continuity.

The Company discloses a comprehensive risk management framework, overseen by its Board and executed through a PepsiCo Risk Committee, division and country risk committees and a dedicated risk management office, which together identify, assess, prioritize and monitor strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety and reputational risks, and report regularly to the Board’s Audit Committee. It emphasizes business continuity through disaster recovery planning for adverse weather, natural disasters, pandemics, cyberattacks and other catastrophic events, maintains network security, backup and disaster‐recovery measures, and coordinates with bottlers, manufacturers and distributors to restore and sustain operations in the face of supply chain disruptions, power or water shortages, and other emergencies. The Company’s procurement strategy—including fixed‐price contracts, purchase orders, pricing agreements and commodity hedges—serves to mitigate raw material and energy price volatility, while its productivity initiatives and global operating model investments enhance organizational flexibility, operational efficiency and resource reallocation. It also describes scenario planning for environmental perturbations, political and economic volatility, and regulatory changes, and underscores its commitment to emergency management, crisis response procedures, insurance programs and compliance controls to preserve system integrity, maintain performance under pressure and adapt to or emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

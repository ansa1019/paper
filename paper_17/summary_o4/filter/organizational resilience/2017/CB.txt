The Company’s 2017 Form 10-K discloses a comprehensive suite of practices and capabilities that together constitute its approach to organizational resilience and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Underwriting controls, dynamic risk models and third-party reinsurance (including excess-of-loss layer structures and reinstatement premiums) are used to absorb strain from natural disasters, terrorism, cyber-attacks and pandemics, while geographic diversification, program limits and collateral arrangements mitigate concentrations of exposure. Reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are established using informed estimates and actuarial judgments, supplemented by structured transaction reviews and risk-transfer analyses to ensure the reasonable possibility of significant loss for the reinsurer and effective resource reconfiguration. Liquidity is preserved through disciplined cash-flow management, short-term investments, notional cash pooling, repurchase agreements and secured credit facilities, enabling rapid response to large or unexpected claim payments. Business continuity and operational flexibility are reinforced by contingency plans, infrastructure redundancy, ongoing cybersecurity governance, vendor oversight and incident response protocols. The Company also employs analytical modeling techniques—stochastic, predictive and catastrophe simulations—and “what-if” stress testing of probable maximum loss scenarios to inform strategic resource allocation, recalibrate risk appetites and maintain performance. Integration-related savings, merger diligence, harmonization of retirement programs, and investments in digital transformation illustrate its capacity for adaptation, systemic change and the emergence of competitive advantage from disruptive events. Financial strength ratings, ratings-based default factor analysis and counterparty credit assessments support the preservation of financial resources and the timely recovery of reinsurance recoverables, while derivative hedges for variable annuity guarantees further stabilize performance under pressure. Together, these measures reflect a multifaceted resilience strategy—spanning risk mitigation, resource generation, operational continuity and strategic agility—to preserve integrity and functioning despite internal or external variations.

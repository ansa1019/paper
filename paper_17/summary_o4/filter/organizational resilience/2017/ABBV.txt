AbbVie’s Form 10-K describes a comprehensive risk management and operational framework designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity, including identification of a wide spectrum of internal and external pressures—from patent expiring and generic competition through manufacturing interruptions, single-source supplier failures, regulatory changes, economic volatility and cybersecurity risks—and the deployment of business interruption insurance, alternative sourcing plans, quality assurance and compliance programs to maintain continuity of production and supply chain integrity. The company reports generating $10.0 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, which it systematically allocates to research and development, cash dividends and share repurchases to sustain liquidity and fund future innovation, while using interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges to mitigate financial volatility. In response to intellectual property threats, AbbVie “vigorously defends its patents” through litigation and administrative proceedings, reflecting a dynamic capability to confront disruptive events and preserve competitive advantage. Revenue-related controls—such as estimating rebate accruals, managing inventory levels, monitoring customer creditworthiness and communicating on receivable payment plans—support commercial resilience, and the regular review of contractual obligations, pension funding and deferred tax assets ensures adaptability of resource deployment under evolving economic and legislative environments. This multifaceted approach—combining proactive risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, strategic foresight and operational flexibility—embodies AbbVie’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and sustain performance amid uncertainty.

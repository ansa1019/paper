The Company emphasizes the critical importance of maintaining reliable and scalable technical infrastructure, including the operation of data centers with adequate reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could disrupt user access and advertising delivery; it acknowledges that its systems may experience interruptions from earthquakes, adverse weather, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, cyber-attacks or other catastrophic events and that it may not be able to recover technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide services; it identifies risk-mitigation measures such as increasing investments in security, content review, data center capacity, network capacity, computing power and headcount to support user growth and engagement and to enhance operational flexibility; it maintains a $2 billion revolving credit facility and manages cash, marketable securities, and tax liabilities—such as the one-time transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—to support liquidity and operational continuity; it continues to allocate substantial resources to research and development and strategic initiatives—helping businesses expand their use of mobile products, developing innovative ad products, making ads more relevant through targeting and outcome-based measurement, driving growth in established ecosystems (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp), and advancing long-term technologies such as connectivity, artificial intelligence, and augmented and virtual reality—to adapt to evolving market conditions; and it routinely evaluates and responds to regulatory, competitive and technology-driven constraints, acknowledging that systemic and third-party risks, software vulnerabilities, and supply-chain complexities may impair its ability to preserve or improve its functioning under challenging conditions.

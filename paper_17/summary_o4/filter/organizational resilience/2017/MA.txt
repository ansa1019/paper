We maintain a comprehensive information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage reviewed by our board and its audit committee, with multiple layers of protection, continuous testing and targeted investments in safety, security and resilience engineering to discover and address potential vulnerabilities and preserve operational continuity under internal or external variations. Our global multi-rail processing network, which today facilitates the authorization, clearing and settlement of transactions across more than 210 countries and territories, is designed to absorb strain from technology malfunctions, telecommunications disruptions, power outages, fire, weather events, security breaches and other catastrophic events while continuing to serve customers and account holders when and how they want to be served. We implement policies, procedures and internal controls to manage money-laundering, terrorist-financing, anti-corruption and sanctions risks, proactively monitor customers’ financial condition and economic and political operating environments to mitigate settlement exposure, and continually adapt our products, services, fee structures and operational processes to comply with evolving global regulatory and legislative requirements—such as interchange-fee caps, strong customer authentication standards and critical-infrastructure oversight designations—so as to reconfigure our operations, allocate resources effectively and maintain performance under pressure. Our expansion into real-time account-based payment systems through acquisitions requires careful integration of technology and corporate culture, risk assessment of regulatory oversight, reconstitution of service delivery models and dynamic resource deployment to address transformational change. We recognize that external disturbances, complex stakeholder relationships, third-party dependencies and competitive and technological disruptions could materially affect our reputation, liquidity and results of operations, and we believe that our diversified cash and investment portfolios, access to committed credit facilities and ongoing stress analysis of global economic, political, tax and litigation exposures provide the financial flexibility and adaptive capacity needed to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

The Company acknowledges its exposure to macroeconomic downturns, market volatility and intense technological and pricing competition—external disturbances that require rapid responses in product development, pricing and resource allocation—while maintaining a foundation of in-house manufacturing technologies to ensure consistent supply and differentiated features, thereby reinforcing its capacity to absorb strain and preserve performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. It discloses risks from political, social, economic and security pressures, terrorism, health epidemics, natural disasters and breaches or disruptions of information technology systems—events that could disrupt transportation, communications and manufacturing operations—and describes strategic measures such as diversified supplier relationships, proactive inventory and quality management, significant investments in research and development, and reliance on cash flows from operations and a revolving credit facility to safeguard business continuity, adapt to environmental perturbations and reconfigure resources as needed. The firm further recognizes that successful execution of business and organizational changes—including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring—depends on timely integration and reconstitution of operations and technologies, underscoring its dynamic capabilities and systemic perspective on resilience. Finally, by managing liquidity, capital expenditures and financing arrangements to support working capital, investments and debt obligations, the Company demonstrates a forward-looking, multifaceted resilience strategy aimed at maintaining integrity and performance, mitigating risks and emerging stronger from disruptive events.

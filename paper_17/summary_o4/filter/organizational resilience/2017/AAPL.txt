The company acknowledges that while its arrangements with outsourcing partners “may lower operating costs, they also reduce the company's direct control over production and distribution” and that “it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the company's flexibility to respond to changing conditions.” To help ensure continuity of supply, the company “has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements,” yet it recognizes that supplies “could be reduced or terminated” if those partners experience severe financial problems or other disruptions. In anticipation of volatile demand and rapid product obsolescence, the company “records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value” and “accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components,” with manufacturing purchase obligations typically covering forecasted requirements for periods up to 150 days. The company further notes that its complex hardware, software and online services “may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors” and that “system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company's business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities,” any of which “could adversely impact the company's business by, among other things, preventing access to the company's online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company's products.” To bolster operational resilience, the company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including encryption and other security measures, and actively monitors its systems for unusual activity. It also recognizes exposure to “natural and man-made disasters, public health issues and other business interruptions,” such as pandemics, war, terrorism and geopolitical uncertainties, which could “make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers” or receive components from suppliers, thereby necessitating adaptive strategies, crisis response capabilities, emergency management and recovery mechanisms to preserve functioning and performance under challenging conditions.

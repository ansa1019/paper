The report emphasizes that the company’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions depends on the proactive identification and monitoring of material risks—ranging from market and economic volatility, regulatory and geopolitical changes, natural disasters and other disruptions of expected business conditions—to ensure business continuity.  It underscores the importance of maintaining access to diversified capital markets and revolving credit facilities, of deploying system redundancy and disaster recovery planning for information technology and physical facilities, and of preserving operational flexibility through dynamic capacity realignment, inventory management and intersegment transfers to address unexpected demand fluctuations.  The company routinely implements significant restructuring activities and productivity improvement initiatives to reconfigure its cost structure, allocate resources toward innovation and sales and marketing growth, and integrate or divest businesses to reconstitute its portfolio and capture synergies.  It also invests organically and through acquisitions in new product development and globalized manufacturing, research and customer-facing resources to adapt to rapid technological change, while diversifying across geographies, industries and product lines to reduce concentration risk and sustain performance under pressure.  A comprehensive risk management framework—including legal, tax, environmental, cyber-security and supplier standards of conduct—supports mitigation of hazards, preserves system integrity and financial liquidity, and reinforces the organization’s resilience in nominal, extreme or exceptional scenarios.

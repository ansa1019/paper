The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a range of resilience and continuity practices. It acknowledges that its operations and financial results face various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect business continuity, and that delivering increased services and solutions in the cloud “puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans” while magnifying “the potential impact of prolonged service outages” on operating results. Recognizing that its corporate headquarters and essential operations are in seismically active regions, the report warns that “a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event” could “harm our ability to conduct normal business operations.” To address environmental turbulence and disruptive change, the Company “is undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation,” and it invests substantially in datacenters, network infrastructure, and security controls to sustain functionality and performance under evolving constraints. It further identifies the need to execute organizational and technical changes—such as ensuring cloud-based services meet reliability and security expectations, maintaining robust internet connectivity infrastructure, and properly scaling operations in response to increased user traffic—to preserve system integrity, mitigate operational failures, and enable resource reconfiguring and adaptation. Additionally, strategic responses include reorganizing the global sales organization to pool resources and enhance agility, continuous investments in research and development and data analytics capabilities to improve operational efficiency and innovation, and ongoing enhancements to security and privacy measures to anticipate and defend against external pressures. These disclosures collectively reflect the Company’s multifaceted approach to absorbing strain, preserving functionality, and preparing for unexpected situations across hierarchical levels, thereby preserving organizational strength and supporting long-term resilience.

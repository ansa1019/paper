PepsiCo’s 2016 Form 10-K describes a comprehensive risk management framework and related operating practices designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, including weather events, political instability, supply chain disruptions, currency fluctuations, regulatory changes and cyberattacks. The company emphasizes its “Performance with Purpose” strategy, embedding sustainability and environmental responsibility—such as water conservation, energy efficiency, packaging reduction and agricultural innovation—into long-term growth plans to strengthen business continuity and adaptability. PepsiCo maintains robust internal controls, divisional and country risk committees, and an enterprise risk committee that oversee strategic initiatives, scenario planning and resource allocation, while corporate audit and compliance functions monitor controls and legal, regulatory and safety risks. It invests in automation, shared services and organizational simplification to enhance operational flexibility and competitive advantage, and devotes significant resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery for its information technology infrastructure, requiring the same diligence of third-party service providers to mitigate cyber threats. Real-time monitoring of consumer, market and regulatory trends, combined with productivity agendas that generate cost savings and enable skills upgrading and job retraining, illustrate the company’s focus on mitigating risks, reconfiguring trajectories in response to disruptive events and reconstituting itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

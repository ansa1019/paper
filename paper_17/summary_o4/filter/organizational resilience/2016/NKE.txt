Nike’s disclosures describe ongoing investments in manufacturing efficiency, supply chain resilience and risk mitigation to maintain business continuity, noting efforts to reduce waste, increase automation and speed to market, reliance on contracted manufacturers governed by codes of conduct and contingency measures to absorb disruptions from labor cost inflation, supplier delays or noncompliance and hedging of factory input costs to manage currency pressures. The company emphasizes safeguarding operational continuity and information security through robust data and IT system controls, business interruption insurance and disaster planning to address interruptions from extreme weather, natural disasters, port congestion or cyber incidents, and engages in currency and interest‐rate hedging to preserve financial flexibility. Proactive resource allocation and capital deployment include substantial investments in digital capabilities, direct‐to‐consumer retail expansion and infrastructure to support future growth, complemented by a committed credit facility and debt issuance program to secure liquidity under adverse macroeconomic or credit conditions. Strategic management of working capital, including a futures ordering program to minimize inventory risk, and maintenance of cash reserves, short‐term investments and credit lines, underpin the firm’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure operating parameters and maintain performance under environmental perturbations. The company further addresses brand health and stakeholder trust through structured endorsement agreements, inter‐organizational collaboration with licensees and distributors and strict intellectual property and confidentiality measures, reflecting a systemic approach to risk assessment, organizational adaptability and continuity of core functions despite evolving market volatility and external pressures.

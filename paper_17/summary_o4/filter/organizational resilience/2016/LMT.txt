Lockheed Martin’s 2016 Form 10-K describes a range of measures that support its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, noting that “we seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted” and emphasizing that its “diverse range of defense, homeland security and information technology products and services … makes it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business.” The company details a balanced cash deployment strategy—funding customer programs pending government appropriations, maintaining liquidity through revolving credit facilities and commercial paper, and returning free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases—to absorb funding variations and enhance operational continuity. It underscores disciplined portfolio-shaping activities, including independent research and development, strategic acquisitions, divestitures and internal realignments, “to expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies,” while refocusing resources on core capabilities and affordability initiatives. Operating in a complex, budget-constrained environment, Lockheed Martin adopts a systemic perspective across its four business segments—“improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our customers at affordable prices”—and invests in workforce development and technology to sustain program execution, reconfigure resources, mitigate emerging cyber and environmental threats, and preserve performance, integrity and competitive advantage amid external disturbances.

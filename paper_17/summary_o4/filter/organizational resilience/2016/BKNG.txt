The risk disclosures describe how declines or disruptions in the travel industry – whether stemming from general economic downturns and recessions, sovereign debt crises, currency volatility, geopolitical tensions, “Brexit,” or unexpected events such as natural disasters, pandemics, terrorist attacks and civil unrest – could impair consumer demand and materially adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flows, underscoring the need for business continuity and risk mitigation.  They note that unforeseen events beyond our control can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior and demand for our services, highlighting the importance of organizational flexibility and operational continuity.  The report details how volatility in transaction growth rates, cancellation rates and hotel ADRs during economic uncertainty has necessitated adaptive resource allocation and operational adjustments.  It explains that disruptions in internet access, system capacity constraints, system failures or “denial-of-service” attacks could impair service availability and damage our reputation, illustrating the criticality of disaster recovery planning, redundancy, back-up systems and emergency management.  Security breaches, whether internal or external, and evolving threats such as phishing and SQL injection attacks, are described as potentially causing significant interruptions, reputational harm and financial liability, emphasizing the significance of resilience strategies, risk assessment and mitigation mechanisms, information security and business resilience.  Competitive pressures from large online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation services, as well as meta-search and device companies, require continuous innovation, strategic adaptation, performance and brand advertising investments, and dynamic capabilities to maintain or grow market share and firm performance.  The discussion of performance advertising efficiency, including the impact of ADRs, costs-per-click, foreign exchange rates and conversion rates, reflects ongoing adjustment of resource deployment to sustain positive operating margins.  The report also addresses the impact of rapid technological change, mobile device adoption and evolving search engine algorithms on our services, underscoring the necessity for operational flexibility, ongoing investment in technology and strategic foresight to maintain system integrity and service innovation.  Further, the potential withdrawal or reduced participation of travel service providers and restaurants illustrates the importance of managing inter-organizational collaboration, supply base fragmentation and relationships to preserve organizational effectiveness.  The analysis of acquisition-related goodwill impairment, particularly the revised forecasts and updated strategy for the OpenTable acquisition, exemplifies the need to project temporal trajectories of responses to disruptive events, reconstitute strategic assumptions and reconfigure organizational priorities toward future objectives.  Compliance with evolving tax, data localization, anti-trust, labor, consumer protection and other regulatory regimes worldwide is presented as a source of external pressures and complexity that necessitates proactive measures, legal monitoring and possible strategic changes to sustain resilience.  Liquidity and capital resource management, including substantial cash and liquid investments, a revolving credit facility and senior notes issuances, are discussed in the context of supporting our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions, fund capital expenditures and support share repurchases and acquisitions.  Finally, the absence of material off-balance-sheet arrangements, the detailed contractual obligations and the emphasis on internal cash flow generation, supplemented by potential debt and equity financing, highlight our focus on maintaining positive adjustment under internal and external variations, preserving system integrity, allocating resources prudently and positioning the company to emerge stronger from adversity.

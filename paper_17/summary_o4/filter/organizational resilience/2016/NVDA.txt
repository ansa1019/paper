We describe how business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs, and that interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers may adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions, requiring substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations. We note that security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns, and that we rely on products and services provided by third parties whose own breaches could impact our systems, while data security breaches through non-technical means could expose parties to risk of loss and require increased efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges. We emphasize that any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers and partners, and that our dependence on third-party foundries and subcontractors reduces control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules, exposing us to supply constraints, component shortages or prioritization of competitors’ orders. We acknowledge that failure to meet evolving market needs, identify new products, services or technologies, or adapt our strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner could impair our competitive positioning, revenue and financial results, and that we are currently devoting significant resources to develop technologies and business offerings in markets with less operating history. We disclose that our manufacturing and inventory processes, based on customer demand estimates, involve significant assumptions and that failure to estimate demand properly or to reduce purchase commitments in response to cancellations may result in excess, obsolete or insufficient inventory, impairing our gross margins and customer relationships. We explain that any of a range of risks and uncertainties associated with international operations—such as political tensions, regulatory changes, legal standards, foreign exchange fluctuations and potential interruptions—could harm our business. We point to our efforts to manage liquidity and capital by maintaining $6.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, managing our investment portfolio with diversification and duration limits, repurchasing shares and paying dividends, entering into a $575 million revolving credit facility for working capital, and financing a new headquarters build-to-suit under an operating lease arrangement, each intended to mitigate financial strain and preserve operational continuity.

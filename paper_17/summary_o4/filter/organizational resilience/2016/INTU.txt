The report discloses that business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; acknowledges that we do not have redundancy for all systems, many critical applications reside in only one data center and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities; warns that in the event of significant system disruption we may experience loss of data or processing capabilities, which may cause us to lose customers and materially harm our operating results; notes that any prolonged interruptions may lead to lost customers, additional refunds, negative publicity and increased operating costs; describes the ongoing process of updating customer-facing applications and supporting infrastructure to meet expectations for continuous service availability, but cautions that difficulties or failures in that effort may interrupt service, reduce revenues and damage our reputation; explains that our Turbotax business must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods and that any interruptions during those periods could significantly decrease revenue, cause customer attrition and increase operating costs; recognizes exposure of our business operations, data centers and critical systems to natural disasters, human error, malicious attacks and other events beyond our control, including proximity to seismic faults without earthquake insurance, and warns that a major earthquake or other disaster may materially harm our future financial results; details that a security breach resulting in third-party access to sensitive customer or employee information could materially disrupt our operations, result in disclosure of confidential data, subject us to litigation and cause material losses; concedes that, despite use of commercially available security technologies and controls, such measures cannot provide absolute security, nor can they always prevent fraudulent access, and that the evolving nature of cyber-attacks increases the risk of future breaches; cautions that perceived vulnerabilities or a worsening global cybersecurity environment could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our offerings; and highlights that maintaining competitive advantage and supporting organizational continuity requires continued significant investment of resources in product development, marketing, sales, information technology infrastructure and security capabilities in order to innovate, adapt and preserve performance under challenging, disruptive conditions.

The company’s disclosures reflect a systemic approach to preserving performance under adversity through a variety of resilience strategies and mechanisms. It maintains comprehensive business continuity plans designed to address failures of key information technology systems, third-party network or service provider outages and cybersecurity breaches, supported by investments in network monitoring, expert staffing, employee training and security policies. Foreign currency exposures are managed through derivative instruments and hedging strategies, while liquidity needs are met first from substantial operating cash flow and marketable securities and, as necessary, through commercial paper and revolving credit facilities to fund operating requirements, capital expenditures, recall-related payments and acquisitions. The ongoing implementation of a global enterprise resource planning system illustrates efforts to reconfigure and synchronize operating and financial processes, and the monitoring of manufacturing concentration and sole-source supply dependencies underpins plans to reconstitute production quickly in response to interruptions. Regulatory compliance and quality system inspections are routinely managed through remediation programs and reserves, and the company self-insures for product liability matters and establishes liabilities for uncertain tax positions and inventory obsolescence to mitigate risks. Management’s focus on cost containment, productivity improvement and disciplined capital allocation—prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—further supports the company’s ability to adapt resources, sustain operations and maintain integrity and performance despite internal or external pressures and market disruptions.

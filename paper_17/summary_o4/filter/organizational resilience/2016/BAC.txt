Bank of America’s enterprise risk framework and risk appetite statement provide a systemic perspective on organizational resilience by defining clear roles and authorities from the Board through management-level committees to identify, measure, monitor and control strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and reputational risks. Executive management integrates resilience strategies into annual strategic, capital and financial plans, conducting ongoing stress testing and scenario analysis to project the impact of adverse economic or market events on capital, earnings and liquidity under alternative interest rate, credit and market conditions. The corporation maintains a centralized global liquidity buffer of cash and high-quality unencumbered securities across the parent, bank and broker-dealer entities, supplemented by contingency funding plans, intercompany arrangements and a single-point-of-entry resolution strategy, to ensure continuity of critical funding and operational functions under stress. Business continuity is supported by rigorous operational risk management—deployment of backup systems, cybersecurity defenses, key risk indicators, risk and control self-assessments, independent testing and incident response procedures—enabling the organization to withstand natural disasters, system failures, cyberattacks or third-party disruptions. In the banking book, asset and liability management activities and policy-governed hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures underpin measured adjustment to unexpected rate shocks, while trading-book positions are governed by daily value-at-risk, backtesting and stress-testing limits. Collectively, these processes, controls and governance structures support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and drive the bank’s ability to adapt, recover and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

The company discloses that it pursues strategic and targeted acquisitions, investments and joint ventures to enhance its skills, capabilities and service offerings and to expand into new geographic and other markets, while acknowledging that such transactions require increased capital investment and carry integration risks that may disrupt ongoing business, divert management attention and demand additional resources, particularly given its existing organizational structure. It further warns that acquisitions or joint ventures may incur significant costs—including retention payments, equity compensation, severance, amortization and impairment charges, assumed liabilities and advisory fees—and that difficulties in entering unfamiliar markets or competing against stronger incumbents could impair achievement of desired results. The report emphasizes that the size and scale of its operations—approximately 384,000 employees worldwide—present substantial management and organizational challenges in maintaining consistent standards, institutionalizing knowledge, preserving corporate culture and effectively communicating core values, policies, procedures, strategies and goals across a global enterprise. It underscores the necessity of continuously developing and implementing appropriate processes, tools, internal controls and training to mitigate risks such as employee misconduct, data breaches and non-compliance with regulations, noting that failure to do so could materially impair its competitive position and business objectives. Finally, the company recognizes that changes to its operating model and organizational structure, undertaken to address evolving business needs and accommodate growth, must be successfully implemented to avoid negative impacts on operations and results, reflecting an ongoing need for adaptability, resource reconfiguration, risk mitigation and transformation to preserve performance under varying internal and external pressures.

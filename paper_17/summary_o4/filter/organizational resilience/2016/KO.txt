The Coca-Cola Company’s 2016 Form 10-K describes numerous risk-mitigation and adaptive measures that collectively support organizational resilience—understood as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions—including formal risk assessment and water-stewardship frameworks to address water scarcity, pollution and climate-driven agricultural disruptions; rigorous product safety and quality standards and contingency plans for recalls; structured business continuity and information-systems risk-management programs with disaster-recovery procedures, cyber-security investments, standardized global IT platforms and backup credit facilities; derivative‐based hedging strategies to smooth commodity and currency volatility; inter-organizational collaboration with bottling partners, suppliers, governments and communities to sustain supply chains; strategic refranchising, integration of bottling operations and the productivity and reinvestment program to reconfigure resources, optimize the global supply chain and redeploy savings into consumer-facing marketing and innovation; proactive crisis management for catastrophic events, geopolitical shifts and evolving consumer health, regulatory and competitive landscapes; and the use of its brands, financial strength, distribution system and talent to absorb strain, reconstitute operations and preserve performance across nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

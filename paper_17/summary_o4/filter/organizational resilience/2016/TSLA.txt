The company’s disclosures describe numerous operational challenges and strategic actions that reflect its efforts to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adversity. For example, it has “experienced unanticipated challenges, such as certain supply chain constraints, that forced us to decrease the production of these vehicles from our initial expectations” and warns that “if unexpected issues arise or recur … we may experience further delays,” acknowledging that “because our vehicle models share certain production facilities … the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other models.” To address these pressures, the company emphasizes the need to “implement efficient, automated and low-cost manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains,” introducing new technologies such as aluminum spot welding and high-speed blow forming, and unique design features like autopilot hardware and falcon-wing doors. Recognizing its “limited experience … allocating our available resources among multiple products simultaneously,” it plans significant investments—including the build-out of new high-volume assembly lines, expansion of Gigafactory 1 and Gigafactory 2 under long-term agreements, and integration of SolarCity’s operations—while negotiating with suppliers for cost reductions, seeking alternate sources for highly customized components, redesigning parts to mitigate shortages and controlling expense overruns. The company further describes the need to accurately “forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport … components at much higher volumes,” to expand its sales, service and supercharger network worldwide, and to manage the “residual and credit risks” of its financing programs, all within evolving environmental, safety, regulatory, union, data-privacy and cybersecurity requirements. It also warns that its “substantial consolidated indebtedness” and debt covenants may limit its flexibility, that currency fluctuations could “reduce our revenues,” and that failure to “attract and retain executive officers and other key … personnel” or to secure additional equity or debt financing when required could materially and adversely affect its brand, financial condition and operating results.

Our risk disclosures note that we have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business, and that our framework, administered by our chief financial officer, includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify. We acknowledge that failure to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address changing shopping habits, demands and demographics, or to realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives, could negatively affect our customer relationships, product and service demand, growth trajectory, market share and results of operations. We emphasize that our strategic initiatives to build an omni-channel sales and marketing presence require large, complex programs, integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing, new competencies in many roles and the ability of our management, employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. We continuously invest in customer-facing technology systems that must function as designed, appeal to customers, provide a consistent omni-channel experience and be supported by disaster recovery provisions. We maintain vigilance and make ongoing investments in information security to protect sensitive customer, employee, vendor and company information from increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, recognizing that a breach could materially affect our reputation, drive customers away, increase remedial costs and expose us to regulatory sanctions. Our disclosures identify potential supply chain disruptions—including financial instability among key vendors, political instability, labor unrest, pandemics, natural disasters, transportation capacity constraints, trade policy changes and currency fluctuations—that could impede our ability to source, stock and sell products, and we note that as our fulfillment network grows more complex, its efficient operation is critical to avoiding inventory delays, increased delivery costs and out-of-stock conditions. We also describe the risks of relying on third-party installers and service providers, and our need to manage such relationships carefully to preserve operational continuity and customer satisfaction. To ensure adequate liquidity and capital resources, we rely on cash flows from operations, a commercial paper program supported by a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2021 and periodic issuances of unsecured notes, all of which depend on maintaining strong credit ratings and compliance with customary covenants; we also return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under a board-authorized program. We describe our accounting policies for merchandise inventory reserves, vendor funds, deferred revenues and self-insurance liabilities, which require us to apply judgment regarding current and historical trends, sales forecasts and actuarial assumptions, and we explain our processes for testing goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable, using projected future cash flows and discount rates commensurate with market participant risk. Finally, in our management’s discussion and analysis we speak in forward-looking terms about macroeconomic factors, including sustained home price recovery, improvements in consumer balance sheets and access to credit, that we believe will support discretionary home improvement spending and enable us to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change so that we can maintain performance and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

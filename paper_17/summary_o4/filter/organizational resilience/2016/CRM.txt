The Company’s operational resilience is supported by current disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements under which the production environment and all customer data are replicated in near real‐time to a separate facility, with acquired products served through alternate sites, although these facilities may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, sabotage, vandalism, administrative actions, permitting changes or litigation; despite these precautions, a natural disaster, act of terrorism, facility closure without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy service interruptions. Interruptions or delays in services from third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers have impaired and may continue to impair delivery of the Company’s services, reducing revenue, triggering credits or penalties, causing customer attrition and reputational harm. Inadequate planning for infrastructure capacity and significant strains on data center capacity could lead to performance degradation or service outages, exposing the Company to financial liabilities and customer losses. The Company’s ability to deliver services also depends on the highly fragmented, distributed Internet infrastructure operated by numerous independent third parties, which has experienced outages and delays due to damage, denial-of-service attacks or cyber incidents and could in future result in Internet fragmentation or multiple separate internets, thereby reducing availability of services. Although security measures are in place, breaches caused by third-party misconduct, employee error, evolving attack techniques or fraudulent inducement may expose confidential data, disrupt business continuity and lead to legal liability. The Company’s operations remain subject to interruption by natural disasters, pandemics, fire, power shortages and other events beyond control; although crisis management and disaster response plans are maintained, such events could render service delivery difficult or impossible and, given the concentration of key operations near major seismic faults without earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.

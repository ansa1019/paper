The firm’s disclosures describe a multilayered resilience framework designed to enable “positive adjustment under challenging conditions” by maintaining continuity of its core activities in the face of natural disasters, pandemics, cyber-attacks, geopolitical shocks, market dislocations or internal failures.  A global business resilience committee oversees business continuity planning, scenario and stress testing and the ongoing enhancement of facilities and response protocols; a formal contingency funding plan pre-funds estimated cash and collateral outflows, prescribes decision-making and communication responsibilities, and identifies mitigants; daily liquidity risk modeling and intraday liquidity assessments and a large stock of unencumbered “global core liquid assets” ensure that the firm can absorb funding shocks without disrupting client services; market risk and credit risk stress tests quantify exposures to severe price, correlation and counterparty moves; operational risk management employs self-assessments, loss-event reporting, key metric monitoring and independent reviews to minimize process, system and control failures; cyber-security and technology risk processes continuously monitor and defend against threats; and governance structures, including risk, capital, finance, model-risk and client-standards committees together with board oversight, ensure that resources are allocated, escalation protocols are followed and recovery mechanisms—such as collateral re-deployment, system redundancies, legal and compliance controls and stakeholder communications—are in place to preserve system integrity, adapt organizational processes and emerge stronger from adverse events.

Mastercard’s disclosures describe a range of policies, controls and resource‐allocation decisions that support its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal or external disturbances, whether nominal, extreme or exceptional.  The company maintains an information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage, each reviewed by its board and audit committee, and periodically tests its systems to discover and address vulnerabilities, while its multi‐layered processing infrastructure is designed to withstand cyber‐attacks, technology malfunctions, fire, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism or other catastrophic events.  It has established a committed $3.75 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to provide liquidity for general corporate and business‐continuity purposes, including in the event of settlement failures by its financial‐institution customers, and believes it has sufficient resources to cover peak‐day exposures, supported by ongoing monitoring of customers’ financial condition, operating environments and compliance with participation standards.  The company’s settlement guarantees, which expose it to contingent losses if issuers or acquirers default, are managed through strategies to minimize contingent risk, including assignment of underlying receivables, charging customers for losses in the ordinary course of business and reviewing third‐party obligations and indemnification arrangements.  In response to rapid and significant technological developments, Mastercard invests in the development and deployment of digital and mobile channel strategies, remote connectivity solutions and tokenization technologies, collaborates with third‐party technology platforms subject to industry‐wide standards (such as EMV and PCI DSS), and works to enhance protective measures and remediate information‐security vulnerabilities as threats evolve.  The company’s risk and exposure to regulatory, litigation, competitive and geopolitical pressures is mitigated through dedicated professional legal, compliance and government‐relations teams that defend its right to establish rates and network rules, adapt to expanding obligations in multiple jurisdictions, and adjust its product and service offerings to align with changing merchant, consumer and regulator requirements.  Mastercard’s strategic planning, capital management and acquisition evaluations are conducted with an eye toward maintaining operational flexibility, supporting recovery and transformation following disruptive events, and preserving system integrity and performance while pursuing service innovation, competitive advantage and continued growth across more than 210 countries and territories.

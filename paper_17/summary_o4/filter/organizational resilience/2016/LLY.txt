The Company cautions that “failure, inadequacy, or breach of our information technology systems, infrastructure, and business information could result in material harm to our business and reputation” and acknowledges that “cyber-attacks are growing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity,” yet affirms that “we have implemented measures to prevent, respond to, and minimize these risks.” It warns that “manufacturing difficulties or disruptions could lead to product supply problems” arising from natural disasters, quality or compliance issues, or system failures, and that “failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business.” The Company’s financial risk management disclosures state that it “strives to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance” and that it “manages a portion of foreign currency exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques” under a policy defining “minimum and maximum hedge coverage,” with derivative gains and losses offsetting the impact of currency fluctuations. In its discussion and analysis, the Company emphasizes that “its long-term success depends on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development,” and that it “manages research and development spending across its portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in total research and development spending.” Management further describes ongoing monitoring of “potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of wholesalers and other customers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels,” and affirms that “amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs” and that “cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. and planned repatriations of foreign earnings ... should be sufficient to fund domestic operating needs, dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures.” The Company also explains that it maintains accruals for “sales returns, rebates, and discounts” based on “historical return rates,” inventory levels, and “specific anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity,” and that “adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimates,” which historically have been less than 2 percent of net revenue. Finally, the Company describes its periodic reviews for impairment of long-lived assets and the use of actuarially determined discount rates and expected return on plan assets in pension and retiree health benefit calculations to ensure precise measurement of service and interest costs.

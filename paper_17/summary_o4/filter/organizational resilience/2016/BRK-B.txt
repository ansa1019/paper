In our risk factors discussion, we acknowledge our dependency on key personnel for major investment and capital allocation decisions and note that Berkshire’s board of directors has established and continually monitors a succession plan and identified capable subsidiary managers to ensure functional continuity under unexpected service unavailability. We recognize that our decentralized business model, with minimal corporate involvement in day-to-day operations, coupled with senior management’s oversight of capital allocation, governance and the “tone at the top,” provides operational flexibility and supports the maintenance of performance under economic perturbations. While each operating business faces intense competitive pressures, we focus on developing and protecting competitive advantages through strategic initiatives, cost-containment programs and innovation to maintain integrity and performance amid market and technology changes. Our risk management practices emphasize the importance of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel to meet surges in demand and preserve functioning of our operating units. We invest in business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate cyber security and other operational disruptions. We maintain significant cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills, prioritizing safety over yield to uphold financial resources and liquidity under volatile market conditions. Our insurance, railroad and utilities businesses assess and provide for catastrophic and environmental liabilities, systematically evaluate loss-emergence patterns and adjust reserves to absorb strain and preserve performance in adverse events. Additionally, we regularly plan and fund ongoing capital expenditures from operations and debt markets to sustain infrastructure and service delivery under challenging economic cycles and regulatory changes, thereby supporting the maintenance of organizational integrity and positive adjustment amid internal and external disturbances.

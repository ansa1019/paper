Management’s disclosures acknowledge that a wide array of internal and external pressures—ranging from global and regional economic volatility, tightening credit markets, currency fluctuations and competitive price cutting to disruptions caused by natural disasters, public health crises, terrorism, industrial accidents, information technology system failures and supplier insolvencies—can materially impair the company’s ability to maintain operations and deliver products and services.  To mitigate these risks and preserve functioning under such challenging conditions, the company maintains system redundancy and disaster recovery planning, devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and authentication technologies, and monitors accounts for unusual activity; invests in manufacturing process equipment, component prepayments and diversified sourcing arrangements and accrues cancellation‐fee reserves to secure supply continuity; enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge exposures; records reductions to revenue for price protection, customer incentive programs and expected product returns; maintains substantial cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held domestically and abroad; issues debt and repurchases shares under a capital return program funded by operating cash flows and borrowings; structures its operations across geographic segments to align with local market dynamics; upholds compliance policies and indemnification provisions; and continually invests in research and development and product transition processes.  These combined strategies, resources and organizational practices support the company’s ability to absorb strain, adapt resource allocation and reconfigure operations, thereby sustaining partial performance, preserving integrity and enabling positive adjustment under both nominal and extreme disturbances.

Our disclosure describes significant investments in upgrading our technology and information security and controls to maintain the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems and data, including our clients’ systems, as cyber-attack threats evolve, and the maintenance of business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities to mitigate operational failures in our transaction processing businesses and avoid interruptions that could damage client relationships or revenue. We undertake active portfolio management of our businesses, disciplined capital allocation and strategic initiatives to enhance the value of our client relationships through differentiated innovation and integration of products and services, deploying operational effectiveness initiatives and scale efficiencies across the company to improve our cost structure and operational flexibility. In response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we invest in the development and introduction of innovative products and services, adapt our offerings to changing technology and marketplace needs, and facilitate clients’ migration from in-house technology to outsourced solutions to sustain competitiveness. We manage our liquidity and access to financial resources through a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, a term loan and senior notes, ensuring our ability to fund normal operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt service under varying market and economic conditions. We also allocate resources for the integration of acquired businesses and periodically review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, all of which support our ability to absorb strain, preserve performance and adapt to internal and external disturbances.

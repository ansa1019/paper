Microsoft acknowledges that its operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of its common stock, and that intense competition, disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services require it to remain competitive by making innovative offerings. The company is undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation, and its increasing reliance on data-driven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. It devotes substantial resources to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade its technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic, maintain a robust and reliable Internet connectivity infrastructure within competitive and regulatory constraints, and rapidly grow its platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties. Microsoft warns that inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish product and service quality, result in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, damage to its reputation and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may harm its operating results and financial condition. It also highlights the risk of system or operational disruptions from catastrophic events—major earthquakes, weather events, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, or other events—in seismically active regions that host its headquarters and R&D activities, and emphasizes that providing more services and solutions in the cloud “puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans” and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on operating results. The company describes cyber threats as constantly evolving with cascading impacts across its internal networks and those of its partners and customers, and states that “to defend against security threats … we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.” It acknowledges that customers’ failure to update their systems or perceptions of vulnerabilities could delay adoption of additional products or services and lead to claims against Microsoft. The company further recognizes its success is highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees, the importance of effective succession planning to ensure smooth transitions and transfer of knowledge, and the challenges of integrating acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances—including the pending LinkedIn acquisition—while leveraging them to enhance existing products and services. It also notes that government litigation and regulatory activity may require it to design alternative product versions, withdraw products from certain geographies, or make licenses available on terms that may not reflect fair market value, and that compliance with anti-corruption, privacy, trade, competition, tax, and other laws may impose significant costs or require changes to its business practices. Together, these disclosures describe the company’s need to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning despite adversity, preserve system integrity under internal or external pressures, adapt to environmental perturbations, and strengthen its capacity to recover from or benefit from disruptive change.

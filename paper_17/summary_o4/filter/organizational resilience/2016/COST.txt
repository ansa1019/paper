We cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, yet we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items; our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting near-term gross margin; we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses, and although lower initial operating profitability and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses can occur, these negative aspects are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations; our online business growth both domestically and internationally has also increased our sales; our membership format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue; with respect to employee compensation, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize wages and benefits but to maintain levels better than the industry average in order to reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction; our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and other international operating segments, with certain countries exhibiting higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, and varied competitive dynamics; we monitor and quantify the impact of foreign-exchange rate changes and gasoline price fluctuations on net and comparable sales, and we mitigate these external pressures through prudent growth and pricing strategies; accelerated vendor payments of approximately $1,700 made in the last week of fiscal 2016 in advance of implementing our modernized accounting system, together with ongoing investments in information systems modernization—including increased depreciation and service contract costs—illustrate our proactive resource reconfiguration and strategic foresight; management believes that our cash position, operating cash flows, short-term investments, bank credit facilities and structured debt issuances will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future; during 2016 we repatriated earnings in our Canadian operations formerly considered indefinitely reinvested and have reassessed our tax-position contingencies accordingly; we maintain contractual commitments under operating and capital leases, purchase obligations and insurance/self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities, and we evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment when market or operational conditions warrant; finally, our critical accounting estimates—based on historical experience and reasonable assumptions—underscore our capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance under challenging conditions.

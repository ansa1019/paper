The company’s disclosures recognize that maintaining continuous service delivery and preserving performance under adverse conditions requires significant organizational capabilities and resource allocation.  They acknowledge that cyber-security breaches, malware, hacking, phishing or denial-of-service attacks, as well as defects in updates and errors in delivering, configuring or hosting services, could disrupt operations, trigger litigation, indemnification obligations, regulatory investigations, fines, reputational damage, customer losses, remediation expenses and liabilities that exceed available insurance.  The firm further notes that its data centers and co-located facilities are vulnerable to natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, fires), power outages, sabotage, vandalism, operator error, terrorism, pandemics and political unrest, and, despite crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible to deliver services, impair data integrity, lengthen recovery time, decrease demand and impose substantial costs.  It also highlights environmental and macroeconomic uncertainties—currency fluctuations, global financial instability, shifting tax and trade policies—that may impede forecasting, cash-flow generation and cost management, and it emphasizes the need for ongoing investments in capacity, security measures, infrastructure and specialized personnel to support anticipated growth, enter new markets, manage competitive pressures and adapt rapidly to changing customer needs.  These combined risks and the firm’s planned investments in data center capacity, cloud infrastructure, quality controls, human resources, and professional services describe its approach to risk mitigation, operational flexibility and the preservation of service integrity—core elements of organizational resilience.

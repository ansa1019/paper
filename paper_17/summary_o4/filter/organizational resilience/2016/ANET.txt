The company discloses that it has “experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure,” and warns that “if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes” – including continuing “to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems” – this may lead to “disruption of our current operations and end-customer relationships,” an “inability to manage the growth of our business,” and an “inability to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses and earnings.”  The report further acknowledges that its “limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth” and that it “has encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries.”  Supply chain vulnerabilities are highlighted by reliance on “sole limited sources of supply” and “third-party contract manufacturers,” which expose the company to “supply shortages or supply changes” that could “disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries,” “result in lost sales, reduced gross margins or damage to our end-customer relationships,” and require “extremely costly and time consuming” design-arounds.  The risk factors also describe customer concentration and the potential for “significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations” in revenue, “long and unpredictable” sales cycles, possible “disruption in our sales channel or termination of our relationship with important channel partners,” intensifying “competition” that could reduce margins or market share, and exposure to “environmental disruptions,” “natural disasters,” “cybersecurity breaches” and “unexpected errors, omissions or fraud.”  Absent timely process improvements, risk mitigation, operational flexibility and strategic resource deployment, these internal and external pressures could materially impair the company’s ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

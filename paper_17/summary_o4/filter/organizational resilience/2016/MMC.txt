In its risk factors the company underscores its reliance on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, cautioning that challenges in implementing, maintaining or upgrading safeguards, detecting and responding to advanced persistent threats, or integrating acquired systems could disrupt operations, divert resources, damage reputation and cause financial loss. It warns that service interruptions or the cessation of service by key vendors resulting from system failures, capacity constraints or other events could impair its ability to offer products and services, incur contractual or regulatory penalties, trigger liability claims and harm client and employee relationships. The company recognizes that local or regional disasters or other business continuity events—including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terrorist attacks, pandemics, security or cyber-attacks, power or telecommunications failures—may impede the availability of personnel, facilities and critical systems, and that its inability to successfully recover from such events may cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions and reputational harm. It states that it regularly assesses and enhances its business continuity plans and key management succession, invests in technology systems and infrastructure, deploys new processes and adapts colleague roles to capture efficiencies, and must anticipate and respond effectively to digital disruption, technological change, macroeconomic or political developments such as Brexit, and adverse legal or regulatory changes—including evolving trade sanctions, anti-corruption requirements and limitations on foreign currency repatriation—that could limit its operational flexibility. The company further cautions that volatility or declines in insurance premiums, market trends, constrained access to capital, and intense competition for talent and from alternative risk solutions may impede its ability to maintain performance, adapt to challenging conditions and sustain its business continuity and financial resilience.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock; intense competition, rapidly evolving industries, changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services require us to accurately anticipate technology developments and continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our search technology and existing products and services and introduce new offerings that our users can easily and effectively use; our ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our current operations; we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices; interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services—our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the effects of climate change, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems—and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities; we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis and may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure; we may experience supply shortages or other supply chain disruptions driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters, and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers, and some components we use in our products are available only from a single source, which could negatively impact our operations; acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, dilute our equity, incur contingent liabilities, disrupt management focus, or fail to realize anticipated benefits; compliance with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide range of subject matters and increasing regulatory scrutiny could require us to incur substantial costs or change our business practices in ways that disrupt our operations; our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users, yet Internet access providers and governments may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services; accordingly, we have implemented risk assessment and mitigation measures, resource allocation processes, hedging strategies, and disaster recovery and business continuity planning to preserve our integrity and maintain at least partial performance under a wide range of internal or external pressures, constraints, failures, or disturbances.

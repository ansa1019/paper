In our disclosures, we emphasize the maintenance of operational continuity and performance under a variety of internal and external pressures, outlining the risks and mitigation strategies associated with our information technology systems, supply chain, multichannel retail platforms and capital allocation. We describe reliance on periodic maintenance and security measures to protect IT infrastructure from power outages, cyber-attacks, design errors and catastrophic events, while recognizing that errors, interruptions or service cessations could significantly disrupt operations and customer interactions. We note that disruptions in customer-facing technology or failures to safeguard privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information or to comply with evolving payment network rules and cybersecurity standards could lead to substantial costs, reputational damage, litigation and constraints on payment facilitation. We acknowledge intense competitive pressures that may require aggressive promotional pricing, enhanced marketing, superior customer experiences and rapid adaptation to changes in consumer preferences, demographics, localized tastes or delivery expectations to sustain market share and financial performance. In our supply chain, we discuss potential disruptions arising from weather-related events, natural disasters, trade policy changes, supplier instability and logistics interruptions, and we implement initiatives such as Project Sync and our new customer order management system to streamline lead times, improve inventory turns and create an end-to-end solution to enhance resilience across suppliers, transportation providers, distribution centers and store associates. We also detail processes for regulatory compliance, licensing and quality management of our installation services, and caution that failures in selecting and integrating acquisitions, implementing technology, allocating capital or managing supplier alliances could impede anticipated synergies, disrupt operations or impair competitive positioning. Strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016, including the redesign of HomeDepot.com, enhancements to our mobile app, the deployment of BOPIS, BOSS and BODFS programs, and the enabling of dynamic ETA features, are presented as adaptive strategies to anticipate and meet evolving customer demands. Finally, we affirm that our access to cash flow from operations, commercial paper facilities, long-term debt markets and disciplined capital allocation—including share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures—are intended to preserve liquidity and support sustained performance under both nominal and adverse conditions.

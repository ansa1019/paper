The Company manages fluctuating demand and capacity constraints by resizing operations—adjusting workforce levels, storing locomotives and rail cars, and realigning network capacity—and by continually enhancing its transportation planning, yard and terminal operations, and surge‐capability measures to preserve service levels under varying demand conditions. It invests in expanding capacity, renewing existing infrastructure, and deploying resources to maintain network fluidity, optimize train speed and terminal dwell times, and ensure operational continuity in the face of weather‐related events, regulatory changes, or unplanned fluctuations in customer needs. A multi‐faceted safety and risk mitigation program—featuring technology deployments such as Positive Train Control, continuous improvement cultures (“Total Safety Culture,” “Courage to Care”), proactive risk assessments, defect detection, crossing improvements, and targeted capital investments—supports the system’s integrity and performance under pressure. The Company’s strategic use of information technology and cyber-security measures, combined with fuel surcharge mechanisms to hedge fuel price volatility and diversified liquidity sources (cash from operations, committed credit facilities, receivables securitization, commercial paper and bond issuances), underpins its financial resilience and ability to absorb strain without compromising ongoing operations. Its capital plan prioritizes the renewal and improvement of track, locomotives, freight cars, and terminals, alongside continued investments in technology and safety, all aimed at preserving long‐term performance, competitive advantage, and the capacity to respond effectively to disruptive events. Workforce flexibility is enhanced through productivity initiatives, training programs, and labor‐agreement negotiations designed to avert service interruptions, while actuarial and legal assessments of environmental, personal injury, and pension liabilities further safeguard organizational health and stakeholder value under challenging conditions.

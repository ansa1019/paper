We recognize that our forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and potential inaccuracies in underlying assumptions, such that actual outcomes may materially differ from anticipated results if known or unknown factors materialize. In response to declining industry volumes driven by increased taxation, regulatory measures under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, diminishing social acceptance of smoking and illicit trade, we continuously adapt our pricing, product mix and distribution strategies to preserve market share and profitability. To mitigate intense competitive pressures—arising from product innovation, brand differentiation, pricing and geographic market dynamics—we invest in research, marketing and operational efficiencies, including the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products, while acknowledging potential regulatory constraints and consumer adoption risks. We maintain comprehensive business continuity plans, backup information systems and rigorous compliance procedures to safeguard our supply chain, manufacturing and data integrity against economic, political, regulatory and natural disruptions, and we stand ready to reallocate resources or replace third-party manufacturers to ensure operational continuity. We manage currency volatility through pricing and hedging strategies, optimize our capital structure via dividends and debt repayments from subsidiaries, and engage in disciplined tax planning to support liquidity and resilience. Our strategy to attract and retain global talent, strengthen our brand portfolio through selective acquisitions and strategic partnerships, and adjust our operating model in response to evolving climate-related impacts on agricultural inputs further underpins our ability to absorb strain and maintain or enhance organizational performance under adverse conditions, thereby preserving system integrity and competitive advantage.

The Company’s risk disclosures describe a broad set of internal and external pressures—ranging from credit-market volatility, sovereign-debt concerns and economic uncertainty that may lead customers to defer or reduce spending, to sole-source supplier disruptions, component shortages, natural disasters, security breaches and epidemic outbreaks that could interrupt manufacturing, service or sales—that could impair its ability to maintain operations and revenue streams. To preserve organizational health and positive adjustment under such challenging conditions, the Company employs a suite of resilience strategies and mechanisms, including foreign-currency hedging programs to mitigate exchange‐rate risk; diversified distribution channels and leasing and customer-financing options to ensure flexible resource deployment and business continuity; robust service contracts, training and endoscope refurbishment to sustain instrument availability and clinical proficiency; rigorous quality, compliance and regulatory maintenance across multiple jurisdictions to avoid market interruptions; inventory management and alternative sourcing arrangements to address supply chain fragility; insurance and self-insurance reserves to absorb product liability and catastrophic losses; proactive information-technology investments and disaster-recovery planning for operational continuity; and ongoing investments in research and development, partnerships and strategic alliances to reconfigure its product offerings and manufacturing footprint, thereby reinforcing its capacity to absorb strain, mitigate risks, adapt to disruptions and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

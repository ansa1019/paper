We maintain extensive business-continuity and disaster-recovery programs intended to protect our critical financial, accounting, communications and data-processing systems against tampering, breaches, technology outages or other disruptions; however, a failure of these programs to mitigate damage from internal or external events—whether cyberattacks, natural or man-made disasters or infrastructure breakdowns—could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, impair our ability to serve clients and hinder our recovery and adaptation to adverse conditions. We depend on the continued service of our founder, key senior managing directors and other personnel with specialized skills, knowledge and relationships to preserve organizational health and execute strategic initiatives; loss of these individuals, or inability to recruit, retain and motivate successors under evolving incentive and regulatory regimes, may fragment critical leadership, limit our operational flexibility and undermine our ability to adjust to unexpected market or regulatory changes. Our funding model relies on access to debt and capital markets, and volatility in credit availability, interest rates or capital-raising capacity could constrain our resource allocation, impede timely deployment of capital, disrupt financing structures and reduce our capacity to absorb strain in challenging environments. We regularly adjust asset valuations, manage complex cross-fund allocations and implement counterparty and operational risk-management controls to preserve system integrity and performance, but stress in capital markets, declines in asset liquidity or failures by third-party service providers could expose us to significant losses, limit our capacity to respond to systemic shocks and impede our ability to reconfigure business trajectories toward future growth.

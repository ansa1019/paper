nee and fpl operate under a pervasive regulatory framework that affects their business continuity and resource allocation, requiring continuous adaptation to federal, state and local regulations, base‐rate mechanisms and cost recovery clauses and exposing them to the risk that regulatory decisions may force the cancellation or delay of planned development activities, reductions in capital expenditures or the incurrence of nonrecoverable costs. their operational flexibility is tested by severe weather and natural disasters—hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, droughts and icing events—that can cause prolonged outages, property damage, revenue loss, increased restoration expenditures and variability in renewable generation, with restoration costs subject to regulatory approval and potential disallowance. dependence on third‐party transmission, natural gas pipeline and fuel transportation facilities further exposes them to supply chain disruptions. they employ risk mitigation through contractual arrangements, insurance programs and securitized storm‐recovery funds, but limitations in coverage or the unavailability of acceptable terms could require self‐funding and impair financial resilience. cyber attacks, terrorism and other disruptive events pose threats to critical infrastructure and information systems, potentially limiting the ability to generate, transmit, purchase or bill for energy and delaying capital projects, prompting investments in security measures, emergency management protocols and crisis response capabilities. project development and construction face uncertainties including escalating material and labor costs, permitting delays, licensing and rights‐of‐way challenges, disputes with contractors and third parties and technology reliability concerns, any of which may lead to project delays, cost overruns, write‐offs or impairment charges. commodity price volatility, counterparty credit and performance risk and reduced market liquidity may undermine hedging and trading strategies designed to manage fuel, power and financial market exposures, while interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations affect debt service costs despite the use of derivatives and a disciplined capital structure supported by credit facilities, shelf registrations and replacement capital covenants. human capital risks, such as strikes or inflationary pressures on wages and benefits, and adverse litigation outcomes or negative publicity may disrupt operations, divert management attention and strain organizational resources. through these systemic resilience strategies—comprising regulatory adaptation, operational redundancy, financial hedging, capital planning, emergency preparedness and risk assessment—nee and fpl seek to preserve functioning and maintain performance under internal and external disturbances.

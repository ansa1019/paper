Prologis’s disclosures describe a comprehensive resilience framework that encompasses disaster recovery planning, risk mitigation and adaptive resource allocation to preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company maintains system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan for its internal and hosted information technology systems while acknowledging vulnerabilities—such as energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism and cyber attacks—that could interrupt operations and require costly remediation. Management underscores its competitive advantage and organizational strength derived from the quality and scale of its global operating portfolio, deep industry knowledge, technological investments and a strong balance sheet, integrating acquired assets with minimal incremental overhead, leveraging advanced data analysis to streamline operations and enhance decision making. Operational flexibility is upheld through diversified financing sources, including a $3.0 billion global credit facility and a ¥120 billion unsecured yen term loan, disciplined hedging of interest rate and foreign currency exposure and annual evaluation of hazard insurance—sometimes electing self-insurance—to manage earthquake, hurricane and flood risk. Geographic diversification, ongoing compliance with debt covenants and proactive debt refinancing, along with the ability to contribute properties to co-investment ventures or seek third-party capital, support liquidity under adverse market conditions and REIT distribution requirements. The firm allocates capital for development, leasing commissions and tenant improvements to sustain occupancy, rent growth and net operating income despite economic fluctuations, and continually reviews internal controls and disclosure procedures to mitigate errors or deficiencies. Environmental and climate-related hazards are monitored for potential increases in frequency or severity, and impairments are assessed by comparing asset carrying values to future cash flow estimates, with fair value allocations for business combinations adjustable within one year to reflect changing market conditions. Talent retention initiatives, judgment-based asset valuation and strategic reconfiguration of portfolios further demonstrate Prologis’s ability to absorb strain, preserve system integrity and maintain functioning and performance under internal and external disturbances.

In our Form 10-K, we disclose that operating in a “very competitive and rapidly changing environment” in which “new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations” can “adversely affect our business and financial results,” and that “decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales de-leveraging, which creates downward pressure on margins,” reflecting the need to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. To safeguard our organizational health and brand equity, we invest in “training and support” and “monitor the operations of” licensee and joint venture partners to “ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service” and guard against service fragmentation. We acknowledge that “business incidents…that erode consumer trust…and failure to respond appropriately…can significantly reduce brand value,” and that incidents such as food-safety issues may “force us to temporarily close some stores and/or supply chain facilities, as well as recall products,” demonstrating crisis response and emergency management. Cyber-security threats are likewise addressed by “significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes…designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches,” yet we recognize that “these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful.” We maintain incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, noting that “if our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results,” underscoring our commitment to positive adjustment under pressure. Our growth strategy — including “introducing flexible and unique store formats,” “driving convenience and brand engagement through our mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities,” and expanding new store occasions — reflects our strategic agility, resource reconfiguration and future orientation to adapt to disruptive change. We also recognize that “effectively managing growth can be challenging” as it may strain our ability “to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality raw materials, to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high quality product and customer experience,” highlighting the importance of dynamic capabilities and absorptive capacity. We note that “interruption of our supply chain…such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to…the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers…trade restrictions…or natural disasters…could negatively impact our business and our profitability,” and to mitigate this we “use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts… and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure” and “enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows…to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations,” all under a formal market price risk management policy with defined risk limits. We further acknowledge that “failure to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently…may adversely affect our business and financial performance” and that “failure to comply with various laws and regulations…may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties,” prompting proactive human capital management and compliance measures to ensure ongoing resilience and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The company acknowledges that its ongoing ability to maintain operations under adverse conditions depends on robust business continuity and disaster recovery planning, noting that “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability,” and that it “regularly assess[es] and take[s] steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession.”  It states its reliance on network systems and the internet for electronic delivery of products and services and warns that “our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or increased government regulation,” acknowledging that “these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure confidential data” and that “our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective.”  The report likewise highlights risks arising from outsourcing, observing that third-party service providers “may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all,” which in turn “could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm” or “unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption.”  In the context of cyber-security, it cautions that breaches “may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our…systems or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers,” potentially leading to “loss of customer confidence,” litigation or regulatory actions.  Across its strategic discussions, the company underscores the importance of adaptable resource allocation, talent retention, integration of acquisitions and operational excellence—“investing to meet customer needs in high growth areas,” “accelerating digital transformation and stimulating innovation,” and “enhancing leadership and accountability”—as critical mechanisms to preserve functioning, mitigate risk and reconfigure in response to unexpected events.

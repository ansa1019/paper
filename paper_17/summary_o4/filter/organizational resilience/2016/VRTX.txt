The annual report highlights a range of operational and strategic challenges that implicate organizational resilience, noting its dependence on a single-source supply chain for ivacaftor and lumacaftor and warning that “if these manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing product on our behalf and we are not able to promptly identify another manufacturer, we would experience a disruption in the commercial supply,” which would require rapid reconfiguration of supplier relationships and resource deployment; it describes a multi-step international supply chain “subject to shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely,” underscoring the need for business continuity and risk mitigation; it affirms that “we maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures … critical that we do so in a secure manner” yet recognizes vulnerabilities to cyber attacks and natural disasters, leading it to adopt disaster recovery plans to preserve “research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities”; it emphasizes the role of a corporate compliance program “designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems” in order to adapt to evolving global regulations, pricing controls and data protection laws; it warns that operating in foreign jurisdictions exposes the company to “differing regulatory requirements, tariffs, trade barriers and workforce uncertainties” and potential geopolitical disruptions, requiring operational flexibility and strategic adaptation; it acknowledges that collaborators “may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources,” which could necessitate reallocation of internal knowledge and capabilities; and it underscores that unanticipated regulatory enforcement, pricing limitations or patient discontinuations may materially harm revenues, compelling ongoing risk assessment, resource reconfiguration and proactive measures to maintain performance under pressure.

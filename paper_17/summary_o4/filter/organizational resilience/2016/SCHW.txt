Management has established a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management framework and governance structure, under which the global risk committee and various functional subcommittees oversee the identification, measurement, monitoring and mitigation of credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, and model risks. Risk appetite, defined as the amount of risk acceptable in pursuit of corporate strategy, is approved by the board. The asset‐liability management and pricing committee sets capital, liquidity, interest‐rate and investment policies, while the operational risk oversight committee, compliance risk committee, credit and market risk oversight committee, and new products risk oversight committee establish risk limits and tolerance levels. The firm conducts regular liquidity and capital stress testing, maintains contingency funding and capital contingency plans to address low‐probability, high‐impact events, and monitors early warning indicators. In response to OCC recovery planning guidelines, each bank subsidiary is required to develop and maintain recovery plans addressing internal and external financial and operational stress scenarios. The company maintains a robust backup and recovery infrastructure, with routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, a geographically dispersed workforce, and an information security program integrating complementary tools, controls, and advanced monitoring to protect systems, client data, and deter unauthorized access. External vendor risk is addressed through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing performance monitoring. Credit exposure is managed through policies establishing and reviewing limits, collateral coverages, and periodic portfolio reviews. To mitigate net interest margin risk, the company sets guidelines on interest‐rate sensitivity, manages asset‐liability duration, and monitors the repricing profile of interest‐earning assets and funding sources. The disclosure committee regularly evaluates the effectiveness of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting to support organizational integrity and resilience.

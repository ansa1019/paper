The report discloses that KKR maintains proactive risk‐mitigation and business‐continuity programs yet acknowledges that “our mitigation efforts may not be successful” and that “our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from” disruptions, while insurance “might only partially reimburse us for our losses.” It notes dependency on information systems and third‐party hosting solutions, warning that “a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses … could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption,” and that “ongoing cyber security threats … could jeopardize our … systems and networks … or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions … which could result in significant losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to our fund investors and other counter-parties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.” The firm acknowledges “operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions” and emphasizes the necessity of “business continuity and transition planning.” It also underscores that “our most important asset is our people” and that “if we cannot retain and motivate our employees and other key personnel … our business … could be adversely affected,” noting the allocation of “significant resources and capital” to compliance, information gathering and technology to manage complexity and preserve organizational health. The firm further recognizes that its growth strategy “demands greater management attention and dedication of resources to manage the increasing complexity of operations and regulatory compliance” and that failures in its recruiting, retention, compliance or disaster-recovery processes could “impair our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives,” threatening the firm’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions.

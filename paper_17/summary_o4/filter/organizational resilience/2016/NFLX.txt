The company discloses that any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to its computer systems or those of third-party providers—whether due to cyber-attacks, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures or other internal or external disturbances—could result in loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data or theft of intellectual property and thus materially impair its ability to attract, retain and serve members. It has implemented systems and processes to protect its own communications and computer hardware, third-party web hosting and cloud computing services (notably Amazon Web Services) and proprietary and third-party content delivery networks, yet acknowledges that technological or business-related disruptions at any of these providers, failures in its recommendation, merchandising or streaming delivery technology or inability to interconnect with internet service providers may hinder its capacity to efficiently and effectively deliver content. The company warns that the long-term, fixed-cost nature of multi-year content commitments and the need to adjust expenditures and resource allocation in response to fluctuations in membership acquisition, retention and usage can limit operating flexibility, strain liquidity and margins, and necessitate increased marketing outlays to replace cancelled memberships. As it expands internationally, it must manage and adjust its operations to accommodate varied content offerings, cultural and language differences, differing legal and regulatory environments, currency exchange fluctuations, censorship requirements, regional broadband availability and integration challenges from acquisitions; failure to address these risks successfully could harm its business. Moreover, changes in internet or data-usage regulations—including net neutrality, usage-based pricing or discriminatory network management by network operators—may impede access to its service, increase operating expenses and adversely affect membership levels. Reliance on device and distribution partners further exposes the company to risks of technological, content-licensing or regulatory impediments that may impede growth. The company also emphasizes that if it fails to manage change and growth—by refining systems, operational practices and organizational capabilities in its streaming operations and original content production—or to maintain a positive reputation through effective marketing, customer service and public relations efforts, its ability to preserve service continuity, adapt to external pressures and maintain performance under pressure may be impaired. Collectively, these disclosures reflect the company’s efforts to absorb strain, preserve operational integrity and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions through investments in technology, risk mitigation, strategic adaptation and resource reconfiguration.

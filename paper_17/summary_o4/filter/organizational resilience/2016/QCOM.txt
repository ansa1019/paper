As detailed in our risk factors, we face a multitude of internal and external pressures—ranging from regulatory approvals, antitrust clearances and government investigations to dependency on critical suppliers, concentration of customer revenues and potential disruptions in our supply chain—that “could impair our business operations,” limit operational flexibility and “harm our business and financial results,” thereby threatening continuity under adverse conditions. In connection with the proposed acquisition of NXP, we recognize that “the benefits we expect to realize … depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the businesses successfully and efficiently,” and that the use of “a significant portion of our cash … may limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.” To bolster our adaptability and mitigate risk, we implemented a “strategic realignment plan,” which included targeted reductions in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses to “improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth,” and we maintain diversified liquidity sources—including a $4 billion revolving credit facility, a $4 billion commercial paper program and over $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities—that we believe “will satisfy our working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months.” Our reliance on third-party suppliers introduces hazards such as failures to procure raw materials or provide adequate manufacturing capacity and loss of a supplier or inability to meet quality or yield specifications, which could impede our ability to meet customer demand and force us to qualify new suppliers at increased cost. We continue to make substantial investments in research and development and strategic initiatives “to open new or expanding opportunities for our technologies,” while acknowledging that such investments “may not … generate operating income or contribute to future operating results that meet our expectations” and may result in impairment charges or restructuring. Furthermore, we remain subject to litigation and potential adverse rulings—any of which “could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows”—as well as fluctuating market conditions and competitive dynamics that place ongoing strain on our performance. These disclosures reflect our recognition that sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions requires robust resource allocation, risk assessment, strategic realignments and diversified financial and operational measures to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

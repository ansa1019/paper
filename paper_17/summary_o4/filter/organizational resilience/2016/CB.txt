The registrant’s governance framework employs a dispersed share-ownership structure and provisions in its organizational documents that limit voting power to mitigate the risk of Subpart F income inclusion under foreign corporation rules, thereby preserving shareholder value and exhibiting a risk-management response to potential regulatory challenges; acknowledging that the IRS could nonetheless contest these measures underscores the company’s exposure to external pressures. In the first quarter of 2016, subsequent to the Chubb Corporation acquisition and reflecting significantly larger and expanded operations, the registrant implemented organizational changes that reconfigured its structure into six business segments—North America Commercial P&C Insurance, North America Personal P&C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance and Life Insurance—to enhance operational flexibility, resource deployment and functional coherence in managing increased scale and complexity. The concurrent redefinition of the corporate segment to include all run-off asbestos and environmental exposures, results of run-off Brandywine business and Westchester specialty operations for prior years, along with the retrospective adjustment of prior-period amounts to conform to the new segment presentation, further demonstrates the company’s commitment to maintaining reporting continuity, structural integrity and adaptability under evolving business conditions.

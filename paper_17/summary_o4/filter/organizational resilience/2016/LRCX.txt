The Company’s Form 10-K describes how it must continuously reassess and adjust its strategic resource allocation choices and spending in response to variability in customer demand and global economic and business conditions, noting that during periods of rapid growth or decline it faces significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, workforce training procedures and appropriately sized supply-chain infrastructure on a timely basis to preserve or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances.  It discloses cost management programs aimed at aligning expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, while emphasizing that even during downturns it must continue to invest in R&D and maintain extensive worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, warning that failure to adapt infrastructure and resources may leave it unable to scale or may cause overexpansion beyond actual demand.  The risk factors highlight dependencies on key suppliers and primary manufacturing facilities subject to natural or man-made disasters, terrorist activities, utility interruptions and cybersecurity threats to critical information systems, any of which could disrupt operations, result in loss of business or customer trust and impair the timely and efficient operation of the business.  The Company further describes covenant restrictions under its credit agreements and the adverse consequences of higher indebtedness on its ability to obtain additional financing, the need to maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure, and its reliance on diversified financing arrangements—including revolvers, term loans and senior unsecured notes—to support operations, debt service and potential acquisitions.  Finally, disclosures regarding rapid technological change, the need to create and enhance products through significant R&D investments and joint development relationships, strategic alliances, customer and supplier consolidation, and global talent management illustrate the firm’s multifaceted approach to risk mitigation, adaptation and performance maintenance under challenging and unpredictable conditions.

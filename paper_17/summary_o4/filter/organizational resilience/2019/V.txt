Visa’s disclosures emphasize its capacity to absorb internal and external pressures and maintain operational integrity by continuously enhancing compliance programs and business continuity measures in response to complex and evolving global regulations, including domestic processing mandates and data localization requirements that could otherwise limit its ability to adjust product offerings, services, fees and other key aspects of its business. To manage settlement and liquidity risks arising from client defaults or systemic failures, the company maintains global credit settlement risk policies and procedures—requiring collateral when standards are not met—an indemnification framework capped at unsettled transaction amounts, and an escrow account under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan funded by share conversion adjustments. Visa holds approximately $7.5 billion of available liquidity in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments, has access to a $3 billion commercial paper program and a $5 billion revolving credit facility, and employs derivative instruments to manage interest-rate and currency exposures. The company further invests in technology infrastructure, defined benefit plan funding and supplier risk management, and deploys robust cybersecurity defenses and a formal business continuity program to detect, respond to and recover from errors, cyber-attacks, natural disasters or other disruptions, reflecting a systemic, resource-reconfiguring approach to preserve performance and flexibility under challenging conditions.

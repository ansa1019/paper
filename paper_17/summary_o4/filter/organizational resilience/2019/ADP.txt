Our risk management framework encompasses the routine identification, mitigation and monitoring of operational, regulatory, financial and technological risks that could impair business continuity or firm performance, including compliance with evolving laws and regulations, anti-corruption and sanctions regimes, privacy and cybersecurity mandates; we have implemented and continuously enhance policies, procedures and internal controls, binding corporate rules under GDPR, and programs to safeguard personal and business information and client funds, to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber-security incidents, and to manage and upgrade critical payroll, financial, accounting and data-processing systems and applications. We maintain robust disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our operations against natural disasters, terrorist or military actions, power or communication failures, systems disruptions or site failures, and we host applications in our own and third-party data centers with contingencies for facility failures or service interruptions. Our client funds investment strategy is engineered for safety of principal, liquidity and diversification through laddered maturities up to ten years, supported by short-term financing arrangements such as commercial paper, reverse repurchase agreements and committed credit facilities to meet liquidity needs and limit refinancing risk, with established credit quality, maturity and exposure limits to minimize interest rate and credit risks. In pursuing our transformation initiatives—including voluntary early retirement programs, workforce optimization and service-alignment efforts—we allocate resources to technology innovation, operational efficiencies, automation and strategic planning, thereby enhancing system integrity, adaptability and performance under pressure, maintaining positive adjustment amid regulatory change and market turbulence, and positioning the organization to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and emerge stronger from adversity.

Uncertainty about global economic conditions—including credit market disruptions, volatile currency exchange rates, slowed consumer spending, and the potential insolvency of key suppliers—may challenge our ability to maintain operations and meet customer demand, and we have sought to mitigate such risks by monitoring macroeconomic indicators, building inventory levels to address volatility, and diversifying financing arrangements through operating leases, usage-based models, and alternative capital acquisition approaches. Our quality management system and corrective-and-preventive-action processes are designed to preserve product integrity and compliance under internal variations or external disturbances such as natural disasters, epidemics, or cybersecurity threats, and we employ hedging strategies to address foreign currency fluctuations while maintaining diversified distribution channels to support business continuity. We emphasize strategic resource allocation to research and development—illustrated by the introduction of products such as the ion endoluminal and SP surgical systems—to sustain innovation, adaptability, and competitive advantage in the face of potential regulatory delays, unanticipated product defects, or negative publicity that could impede market acceptance. Operating across multiple jurisdictions, we continuously adapt to evolving regulatory requirements—from FDA and CE marking processes to data-privacy laws and healthcare legislation—while managing collaboration arrangements, joint ventures, and acquisitions such as the Schölly Fiberoptic transaction, recognizing that integration delays or disruptions could impair our capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure processes, and preserve performance. Furthermore, we invest in organizational infrastructure and headcount to strengthen local and overseas operations, scrutinize critical information systems to prevent transactional inefficiencies, and maintain sufficient liquidity to fund ongoing operations and capital investments, thereby enhancing our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and ensure the uninterrupted delivery of products and services despite pressures, constraints, or failures.

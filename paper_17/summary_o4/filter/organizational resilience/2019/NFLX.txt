The risk disclosures describe the company’s need to absorb internal and external pressures—ranging from cyber-attacks, system interruptions, natural disasters and partner outages to rapid shifts in competitive offerings, piracy and regulatory interventions—by investing in a proprietary global content delivery network and third-party “cloud” computing services, maintaining redundant communications and computer hardware, and implementing evolving cybersecurity, fraud-control and data-privacy protocols to preserve service continuity and protect member and corporate information. They emphasize ongoing resource allocation toward content acquisition, licensing and original production under multi-year, largely fixed-cost commitments, together with targeted marketing, technology development and strategic partnerships with device manufacturers, MVPDs and international distributors, to innovate service features, sustain member growth and adapt to varied legal, cultural and network operator environments. The company acknowledges that its substantial indebtedness, streaming content obligations and capital expenditures may limit operating flexibility and require prioritization of debt service and content payments when membership growth or revenues fall short of expectations, and that fluctuations in cash flow, changes in tax or net-neutrality regulations, or inability to secure licensing terms could constrain its ability to reconfigure operations, reallocate resources and maintain performance under nominal or extreme conditions.

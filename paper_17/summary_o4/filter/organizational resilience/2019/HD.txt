Our business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and we face intense competitive pressures from traditional, multichannel and online retailers, which we must timely and appropriately respond to through the delivery of a superior customer experience, effective marketing programs and expense control to preserve market share and financial performance. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, consumer preferences, unexpected weather conditions, public health issues or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution centers and maintaining an excellent customer experience. We have been substantially increasing our investments to create the one home depot experience, including significant investments over several years to build one supply chain and streamline operations, simplify customer interactions, provide a more interconnected retail experience, and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products; failure to choose the right investments and implement them effectively could disrupt our operations. We use our digital platforms both as sales channels and as methods of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers, and we continually seek to enhance all of our online and digital properties to respond to new developments and changing customer preferences in an evolving retail environment. We rely extensively on information technology systems to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data, and these systems and those of our third-party service providers are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks and catastrophic events such as fires, floods and hurricanes; although we and our service providers seek to maintain our respective systems and address risks to integrity, security and consistent operations, such efforts may not be successful, which could significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair our ability to meet customer demand and result in lost sales, increased costs or damage to our reputation; such disruptions may result from natural disasters, trade disputes, tariffs, supplier instability or public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have canceled or shifted to virtual experiences for certain supplier and associate events, shifted certain store support operations to remote or virtual, shortened store hours, temporarily closed stores in Puerto Rico, taken steps to manage foot traffic, and expanded our paid time off policy, and we continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our operations as may be required by authorities or that we deem in the best interests of our stakeholders. The implementation of our store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives requires significant capital deployment, real estate projects, system upgrades and specialized personnel; if we are unable to effectively manage the volume, nature and cost of these investments or face delays, defects or interruptions, our operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Our success further depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates while controlling labor costs and supporting strategic initiatives, including a large number of skilled technology professionals, as the market for these resources is increasingly competitive. We have established liabilities for self-insured losses and vendor allowances that require actuarial estimates and judgments; although historical results have not varied materially from estimates, actual future trends could impact our cost of doing business. Changes in laws, regulations or enforcement related to data privacy, labor, healthcare, trade, environmental matters and taxes could increase our operating costs or limit our ability to obtain data for a personalized customer experience, which could adversely affect our operations. Seasonal influences, uncharacteristic or extreme weather conditions, unseasonable or catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and disrupt the operations of stores, support centers and our supply chain and distribution network, which may adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Our ability to continue to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers and expand alliances for both brand name and proprietary products is critical to ensuring timely access to products that meet quality standards and support product differentiation strategies; supply chain or supplier challenges could adversely impact our sales, gross margins and operational performance.

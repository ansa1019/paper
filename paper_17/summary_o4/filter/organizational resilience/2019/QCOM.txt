In our annual report, we highlight the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a suite of resilience strategies designed to ensure business continuity and preserve functioning despite external pressures and unexpected disturbances. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a targeted cost-plan to align our cost structure with long-term margin objectives, deploying resource reconfiguration and operational flexibility to reduce annual costs by $1 billion. We continue to invest heavily in research and development for 4G and 5G technologies and to extend our offerings into adjacent segments—such as automotive, computing, IoT and networking—to absorb market strain, support strategic adaptation and foster future orientation. We mitigate supply-chain risks by diversifying suppliers, securing raw materials and planning for manufacturing continuity in the face of natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts or capacity constraints, thereby strengthening system integrity. Our resilience is further bolstered by inter-organizational collaboration with foundry and assembly partners, strategic acquisitions and minority investments that enhance our knowledge absorption, dynamic capabilities and absorptive capacity. We also manage legal, regulatory and competitive hazards through proactive risk assessment, litigation preparedness and structured responses to antitrust and patent-licensing investigations, ensuring partial performance and recovery under adversity while safeguarding our competitive advantage and sustaining organizational health.

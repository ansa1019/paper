AMD’s annual report identifies its reliance on third-party wafer foundries and ATMP joint ventures to fabricate, assemble, test, mark and pack its products, warning that “we cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements” and that “if we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition”; it acknowledges that “during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive” and that “any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers”; it further cautions that “we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers” and that “if we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products”; the report underscores the need to respond effectively to “fluctuating or late supply” and to maintain operational continuity under “natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions” or “political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters,” which could “disrupt manufacturing or other operations”; it describes seasonal and quarterly sales variability driven by “short product lifecycles, rapid obsolescence and price erosion,” requiring agile demand forecasting and inventory management to avoid “excess or obsolete inventory” and sustain customer relationships; dependency on distributors and AIB partners for marketing, sales and distribution brings the risk that if they terminate relationships or shift to competitors’ products, the company may face impaired customer access and margin pressure; financial resilience is addressed by maintaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.5 billion and a secured revolving facility to fund operations, R&D and strategic initiatives under uncertain global economic conditions; the need for robust information security controls to protect against cyber-attacks, data breaches and system disruptions is highlighted to ensure business continuity; and the report emphasizes adapting to regulatory changes, supply chain constraints and competitive market dynamics through strategic planning, resource reconfiguration and inter-organizational collaboration to preserve organizational integrity, performance and resilience under adverse and unexpected conditions.

Prologis acknowledges that despite system redundancy, security measures and a formal disaster recovery plan for its internal and hosted information technology systems, its operations remain vulnerable to energy blackouts, natural disasters, war, terrorism, telecommunication failures and cyber-security attacks, any of which could interrupt operations, trigger material business disruption and require significant remediation costs. The company mitigates foreign-exchange exposure by borrowing in the currencies of its investments and entering into derivative instruments such as net investment hedges and forwards, thereby absorbing market fluctuations to preserve financial stability. It carries customary property damage, rental loss, hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorism, commercial general liability and environmental insurance—evaluated annually through third-party analyses—and in certain instances, elects self-insurance when commercially appropriate to manage physical risk. Recognizing the limited liquidity of real estate assets, Prologis may deploy alternative measures—including divesting properties, contributing real estate to co-investment ventures, incurring debt or restructuring leases at less favorable terms—to maintain operational continuity and satisfy debt covenants. The company also stresses the importance of robust disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting to prevent errors and misstatements that could erode organizational health and investor confidence. Its development and acquisition programs, which require securing permits, managing partner approvals in co-investment ventures and allocating significant management attention, expose it to project-level uncertainties and potential distraction from day-to-day operations. Prologis further identifies climate change and increasing extreme weather events as potential sources of unanticipated physical and regulatory risk, including stricter energy-efficiency or greenhouse-gas standards, and prepares for the discontinuation of LIBOR by amending loan agreements and monitoring alternative reference rates. Finally, the company’s REIT qualification requirements—mandating annual dividends of at least 90% of taxable income and adherence to asset and income tests—may necessitate short-term borrowings or constrained capital deployment to meet regulatory distribution thresholds. Collectively, these practices illustrate Prologis’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve its functioning under both nominal and extreme conditions, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under adversity.

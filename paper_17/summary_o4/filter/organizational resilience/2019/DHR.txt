Our business confronts a wide range of risks and uncertainties—including market, economic, geopolitical, regulatory, health, natural disaster, supply chain, cyber-security and credit risks—that could disrupt expected business conditions and require the organization to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. The proposed GE Biopharma acquisition, for example, could create demands on management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address, divert attention from existing operations, generate difficulties in integrating personnel, operations and systems, and expose us to unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies. Our growing indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, expose us to interest rate risk and, if we breach covenants, adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, thereby impairing operational continuity. We must forecast and respond to shifts in global economic growth, credit and currency markets, austerity measures, trade policies, healthcare reimbursement and industry consolidation—each of which may demand rapid reconfiguration of resource deployment, pricing strategies, product development priorities and operating parameters to maintain partial integrity and performance under challenging conditions. Our competitiveness depends on allocating R&D funding to products and services with higher growth prospects, anticipating and responding to technological innovation, differentiating our offerings, integrating external knowledge through acquisitions and partnerships, and expanding sales and service capabilities in high-growth markets. Manufacturing or design defects, cyber-attacks, information technology failures or security breaches could interrupt our own or our customers’ operations, damage our reputation, trigger increased costs for security and remediation and necessitate enhanced emergency management and business continuity protocols. Our supply chains are vulnerable to capacity constraints, sole-source suppliers, natural disasters or health crises (including the novel coronavirus outbreak) and geopolitical disruptions; failure to adjust production capacity and inventory to reflect demand or disruptions may cause production interruptions, delays and inventory imbalances that impair operational flexibility and resourcefulness. We regularly assess our portfolio and, when necessary, divest or spin-off businesses to reconfigure resources and sharpen strategic focus, but restructuring and cost-reduction activities can trigger localized strain, slow product improvements and require effective change management, collaboration networks and cultural integration to realize anticipated benefits. Environmental, health and safety regulations, healthcare fraud and abuse laws, data privacy and export controls impose operational constraints, require substantial compliance expenditures and demand cross-functional collaboration, risk assessment and adaptive strategies to sustain performance. Potential litigation, governmental investigations, indemnification obligations and contingent liabilities compel robust risk mitigation and response mechanisms, along with adequate reserves and legal capabilities. Funding defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations, adapting to new tax regimes and resolving foreign withholding tax challenges require ongoing scenario modeling, financial planning and coherence between corporate and business-unit structures to preserve system resilience under evolving financial conditions. Strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and investments entail integration and synergy-realization risks that must be managed through dynamic capabilities, resource reconfiguration, leadership alignment and inter-organizational collaboration to emerge stronger from disruptive events and maintain performance under pressure.

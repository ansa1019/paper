Comcast acknowledges that its businesses “operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries” and that “changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms for viewing content continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models,” prompting it to “adapt our video service offerings and enhance our high-speed internet services, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms and Flex, which can more easily aggregate linear and OTT programming choices for our customers.” The company’s success depends on its ability “to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies,” as well as on expeditious execution of technology initiatives, since “failure to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.” Network and information systems “are critical to our business activities,” and the firm warns that “cyber threats and attacks… could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services,” while “severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires have impacted our services, products and properties from time to time in the past and will in the future,” requiring “large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems to protect them from similar events.” To sustain operational continuity and manage resource needs, Comcast “maintains significant availability under our revolving credit facilities and our commercial paper programs,” relies on “cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing,” and expects “capital expenditures… focused on scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity… and the continued deployment of wireless gateways, cloud DVR technology and international OTT platforms.” Programming expenses and retransmission consent fees are anticipated to rise “due to the timing of contract renewals,” reinforcing the need for strategic cost management and negotiation, while efforts to “focus on growing our higher-margin businesses, including residential high-speed internet and business services,” improving losses in our wireless phone service, and investing in new theme parks and Peacock are central to preserving functioning and performance despite internal and external pressures.

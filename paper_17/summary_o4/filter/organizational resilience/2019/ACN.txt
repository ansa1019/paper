Accenture acknowledges that its substantial global scale—approximately 492,000 employees as of August 31, 2019—creates significant management and organizational challenges that could impair its ability to achieve business objectives by hindering the maintenance of effective standards, the institutionalization of internal knowledge and the preservation of corporate culture, as well as complicating the management and monitoring of personnel and operations and the consistent communication of core values, policies, procedures, strategies and goals. The company further recognizes that, despite training and internal controls, the potential for employee misconduct, including improper use or disclosure of confidential client information or unauthorized social media activity, underscores the need for robust processes, tools and risk mitigation mechanisms to preserve organizational integrity and business continuity. In addition, Accenture notes that periodic changes to its operating model and organizational structure—driven by evolving business needs and size—and the integration of acquired businesses or joint ventures, including the assimilation and retention of key executives, employees and other partners, require dedicated management resources, efficient resource allocation and effective change management to avoid operational disruption, diversion of management attention, significant integration costs and impacts on competitiveness, profitability and ongoing performance.

Following our acquisition of Celgene, we are in the process of integrating a large number of manufacturing, operational and administrative systems to achieve consistency throughout the combined company—a complex, costly and time-consuming process that, if not executed effectively, could adversely affect our ability to meet demand, satisfy financial reporting obligations, maintain clinical trial operations and preserve relationships with customers, suppliers, alliance partners and regulators. We continue to focus our attention and resources on priority disease areas, human capital management, portfolio rationalization and information systems, while streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. We have established governance processes, including formal procedures for monitoring distributor inventory levels and escalating potential compliance issues under our SEC consent order, and we require critical third-party suppliers and alliance partners to deploy business continuity plans that address sourcing, cybersecurity and crisis response to mitigate the risk of supply disruptions, natural disasters, pandemics or acts of terrorism. We maintain backup liquidity in the form of revolving credit facilities and a commercial paper program to ensure financial flexibility, and we regularly assess our capital structure, debt maturities, hedging arrangements and cash repatriation strategies to preserve operational continuity under changing market conditions. Our internal audit, compliance and risk assessment functions evaluate ongoing regulatory, environmental and legal developments and monitor our exposure to pricing controls, reimbursement changes and government investigations, while our enterprise-wide efforts to harmonize standards, controls and policies seek to preserve organizational health and mitigate fragmentation across regions. We invest in adaptive operating models and continuous-improvement initiatives aimed at realizing $2.5 billion of synergies by 2022 across general and administrative, manufacturing, R&D and procurement functions, and we leverage strategic collaborations, licensing agreements and platform consolidation to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and maintain or improve performance despite economic trends, external pressures, supply chain constraints or unexpected events. We recognize revenue net of government-mandated discounts, rebates and returns—estimates that are periodically refined using internal data, third-party market research and direct customer feedback—and we maintain capital reserves and tax valuation allowances to address uncertainties in transfer pricing, intellectual property disputes and contingent milestone obligations. Our information-technology risk management program and cyber-insurance policies are designed to guard against data leakage, system interruptions and evolving threats, and we continue to monitor geopolitical developments—including Brexit, interest rate benchmark reforms and global health emergencies—to inform our strategic agility, decision making and forward-looking resource deployment.

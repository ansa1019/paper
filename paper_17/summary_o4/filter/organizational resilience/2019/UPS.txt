In our filing we acknowledge that changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. and internationally may adversely affect us and that it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate such pressures; to manage this cyclicality we conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories and continually adjust our air and ground network to better match capacity with volume demand, thereby preserving performance under varying conditions. We mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through indexed fuel surcharges and hedging transactions and monitor and manage currency and interest rate risks with derivative instruments to reduce volatility in our financial position and results of operations. We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to support operational continuity amid potential data breaches and system disruptions, acknowledging that such events could materially disrupt our business and require significant additional effort and expense. We recognize that severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters may disrupt our business and result in decreased revenues, and we require significant capital investments—forecasted against uncertain economic trends, regulatory changes and competitive pressures—to ensure adequate aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and equipment for existing operations and anticipated growth without creating excess or insufficient capacity. We believe our cash position, access to commercial paper and debt capital markets, and cash flows from operations provide sufficient liquidity to complete our capital expenditure program and transformation strategy, fund dividend payments, share repurchases, pension contributions and long-term debt obligations through the foreseeable future. We regularly evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure—including debt or equity issuances to refinance existing obligations and fund ongoing needs—and maintain contractual commitments for finance leases, operating leases, purchase commitments and other liabilities in order to deploy resources where required. To manage contingent liabilities, we record provisions when losses are probable and reasonably estimable, self-insure certain employee and business liabilities using reserves based on actuarial estimates of incurred and unreported claims, and evaluate the full range of actuarial outcomes. Our defined benefit and postretirement medical benefit costs and obligations are calculated using actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, healthcare cost trends, compensation increases, inflation and demographic factors; in October 2019 we refined our bond-matching approach for discount rate determination by implementing advanced modeling techniques. We test goodwill for impairment annually in each reporting unit—primarily via discounted cash flow models supplemented by observable valuation multiples—and monitor for triggering events that could require interim impairment testing. We periodically evaluate estimates for useful lives, residual values and fair values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, adjust them prospectively as necessary, review long-lived assets for impairment when undiscounted future cash flows may not support their carrying amount, and record write-downs to fair value where appropriate. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions through a two-step assessment of probability and measurement, and we supplement our GAAP results with adjusted financial measures that exclude items not indicative of underlying operations to assist management in resource allocation and performance assessment.

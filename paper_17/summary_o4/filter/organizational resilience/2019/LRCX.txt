The company emphasizes that “our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies” is critical to its success and its capacity to compete effectively, noting that “intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion” pose an ongoing challenge that may “result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions.” It identifies the attractiveness of compensation and benefit programs, global economic, political and industry conditions, organizational structure, career development opportunities, necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries and a challenging and rewarding work environment as essential mechanisms for preserving operational flexibility and business continuity. The company “periodically evaluate[s] our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness,” recognizing that failure to “attract, retain, and motivate key employees” could impair its ability to capitalize on market opportunities and materially and adversely affect operating results, thereby underscoring the role of human capital management in supporting organizational resilience.

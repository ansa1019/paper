The Company’s annual report emphasizes that “political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations” and that “significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms,” underscoring the need to preserve liquidity and maintain business continuity under adverse conditions.  It describes a geographically diversified manufacturing footprint in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia to mitigate “transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs,” civil unrest, terrorism and macroeconomic instability.  The Company highlights its principal liquidity sources—$648.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility—together with its policy to “reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely,” as mechanisms to ensure operational flexibility and resource allocation in fluctuating markets.  To align capacity with demand and improve cost structure, it has “undertaken various restructuring actions,” including a “repositioning of our global workforce skill set to align with our long-term strategic plan,” the “closure of manufacturing facilities” with production transfers to internal sites and external foundries, and the pursuit of “net annualized cash savings.”  Recognizing critical dependence on information technology, the report warns that systems “may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events,” and it discloses reliance on external cloud providers alongside security measures to safeguard “confidential and proprietary information.”  Supply-chain resilience is addressed through relationships with multiple third-party suppliers for wafers, components, assembly, testing and transportation, combined with inventory management practices to support forecasted sales and mitigate the risk of unsaleable products.  The report further describes continuity planning in its government contracts, debt covenant compliance under its senior unsecured notes and term loans, and contingency measures such as potential earnings repatriation, all of which collectively reflect the Company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid adversity.

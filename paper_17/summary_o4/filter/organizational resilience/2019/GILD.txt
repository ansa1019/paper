We cannot predict or identify all such factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, including global pricing pressures leading to larger rebates or delayed reimbursements that strain revenues and the inability to achieve forecasted sales, fluctuations in product demand and wholesaler inventories that impede accurate forecasting, and unforeseen safety, resistance or drug interaction issues requiring additional warnings or halting sales. Our dependence on third-party manufacturers, distributors, contract research organizations, apheresis centers, shippers, couriers and collaboration partners exposes us to supply-chain disruptions, certification delays, regulatory compliance risks and potential inventory shortages that could impair our ability to deliver products, complete clinical trials or maintain market performance. Operating in more than 35 countries subjects us to financial, political, economic and security risks—such as currency exchange volatility, counterfeit or re-exported lower-priced drugs, trade protection measures and natural or man-made disasters (notably seismic events near our California facilities for which we may lack adequate insurance)—any of which could interrupt operations and materially reduce earnings. We are further vulnerable to cyberattacks and evolving data-privacy and security regulations, including GDPR and CCPA, which threaten our information systems, chain of identity and custody for yescarta, data confidentiality and the confidentiality of our intellectual property. Legislative and regulatory changes affecting reimbursement, pricing transparency, anti-kickback and false-claims laws could require us to incur substantial compliance costs, alter our sales and marketing practices or restrict operations. Collaborative and acquisition activities demand significant resource allocation and integration capabilities; disputes or poor performance by partners could delay development, commercialization or lead to product loss and reputational harm. Moreover, manufacturing complexities, Good Manufacturing Practices requirements and periodic regulatory inspections introduce further points of failure, while reliance on single suppliers and just-in-time materials heightens the risk that interruptions in raw-material deliveries could limit production capacity, delay product shipments, restrict regulatory approvals and ultimately harm our revenues.

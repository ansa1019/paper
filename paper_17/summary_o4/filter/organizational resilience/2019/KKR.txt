KKR has implemented a comprehensive array of risk mitigation and business continuity programs designed to preserve organizational integrity and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including detailed disaster recovery and system resilience plans to address technology failures, security breaches or infrastructure disruptions; internal liquidity and cost‐scaling mechanisms that reconfigure resource deployment in response to market volatility, economic downturns or extreme credit spread widening; fallback provisions in financing arrangements and transition clauses in its revolving credit facilities to ensure operational flexibility and access to funding; diversification across private equity, real estate, energy, infrastructure, credit and public markets strategies to avoid overdependence on any single sector or geography; proactive development of new investment initiatives and successor funds to adapt to shifting investor mandates and regulatory landscapes; stringent contingency provisions and “clawback” policies in its carried interest and incentive fee structures to realign interests in the face of portfolio underperformance; ongoing enhancement of crisis‐management protocols, including adherence to proposed SEC requirements for written business continuity and transition plans; and continuous evaluation of governance, compliance and cybersecurity measures—altogether reflecting a systemic perspective on preserving core functions, managing external pressures, sustaining competitive advantage and supporting recovery and growth despite unforeseen events or sustained adversity.

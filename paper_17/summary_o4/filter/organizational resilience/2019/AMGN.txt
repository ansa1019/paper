Amgen’s annual report describes a comprehensive set of processes and structures designed to support the organization’s ability to absorb disruptions and preserve its functioning under internal and external pressures. The company continuously monitors and revises its accruals for rebates, chargebacks and returns based on contractual requirements, historical trends and evolving payer policies, thereby reallocating resources and ensuring business continuity in the face of pricing, reimbursement and coverage changes. To mitigate financial volatility, Amgen employs foreign‐exchange and interest‐rate hedging programs, maintains a commercial‐paper facility supported by a multi-year revolving credit agreement and holds globally accessible cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as liquidity backstops for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic transactions and dividend payments. Operational resilience is further reinforced through diversified sourcing strategies, oversight of third-party contract manufacturers and sub-suppliers, and contingency planning at key manufacturing sites—most notably the use of backup diesel generators to sustain its Puerto Rico facility through hurricanes, earthquakes and electrical grid instability, as well as measures to address political unrest and supplychain disruptions. The company has established robust cybersecurity and network-control systems, together with ongoing monitoring of pharmacovigilance data and adverse-event reporting, to safeguard its information, product quality and patient safety. Following a settlement with the Department of Justice and HHS-OIG, Amgen has instituted a formal corporate compliance program and five-year integrity obligations to strengthen its risk management and uphold regulatory commitments. The firm pursues inter-organizational collaborations, licensing, acquisitions and alliance management as strategic initiatives to bolster its pipeline and competitive position, while dynamically reconfiguring its research-and-development portfolio—terminating or divesting candidates when necessary and reallocating capital toward high-priority programs—to sustain performance, adapt to regulatory and clinical trial outcomes, and emerge stronger from challenging circumstances.

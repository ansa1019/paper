The annual report describes how rapid growth has “placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure” and required the company to manage “an increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes” spanning hardware and software development, contract manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, fulfillment and maintenance and support in order to preserve operational continuity under pressure.  It emphasizes that “to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems,” warning that failure to do so “may result in disruption of our current operations and end-customer relationships” and undermine forecasting and risk mitigation.  The filing highlights the critical role of accurate demand forecasting for inventory management—“our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages which could lead to delays in fulfilling current and future purchase orders that can impede production by our customers and harm our customer relationships”—and discloses provisions for excess and obsolete component inventory and liabilities for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments as means to balance “the need to maintain sufficient inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence.”  It further warns that reliance on sole or limited sources of supply and third-party contract manufacturers “reduces our control over the manufacturing process, quality assurance, product costs and product supply and timing,” and that supply shortages, manufacturing interruptions, geopolitical tensions, public health epidemics such as the coronavirus or natural disasters could “disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers.”  The company notes its need to develop alternative sources, redesign products if suppliers are unable to meet demand, and qualify new contract manufacturers—“if we add or change contract manufacturers, or change any manufacturing plant locations … we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management and may increase our working capital requirements”—in order to preserve delivery and financial performance.  Recognizing “long and unpredictable” sales cycles and large purchases by a concentrated base of end customers, it warns that “our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate” and that an inability to “sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers, grow revenues with new or other existing end customers … or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases” would materially harm its results.  It likewise stresses the importance of a trained and motivated sales force and global support organization to maintain high-quality support and services and “ensure proper deployment and ongoing support” so as to preserve customer relationships, and flags the complexities of international expansion—compliance with anti-corruption, export, import and data-protection laws, currency fluctuations, trade barriers, political and economic uncertainty such as Brexit, and adverse local regulations—as requiring continuous risk assessment, adaptive controls and robust contingency planning.  Finally, the report acknowledges that natural disasters, acts of terrorism or health epidemics could test its disaster recovery and emergency management plans, noting “any significant interruption in these critical functions … could result in delayed order fulfillment, adversely affect our business” and that “to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of end-customer orders, or delays in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected.”

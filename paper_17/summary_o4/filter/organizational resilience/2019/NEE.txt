NEE and FPLâ€™s operating model reflects a systematic approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by embedding the effects of complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulation into their business planning and cost recovery mechanisms, by allocating resources through base rates, cost recovery clauses and regulatory assets and liabilities to preserve or improve functioning following internal and external variations, by employing derivative instruments to hedge physical and financial exposures in energy, fuel, interest rate and foreign currency markets, by establishing storm funds, reserve amortization mechanisms and insurance programs to facilitate timely restoration of service and replacement power and equipment after hurricanes, severe weather, terrorist acts or cyberattacks, by securing standby letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees to uphold fuel transportation and power purchase obligations, by managing liquidity and capital requirements through access to credit and capital markets and issuances of short- and long-term debt and equity to support plant additions, nuclear decommissioning trusts and asset retirement obligations, and by continuously enhancing information technology systems, internal controls and risk management policies to absorb strain, reconfigure operational trajectories and emerge stronger from disruptions while sustaining system integrity and performance under pressure.

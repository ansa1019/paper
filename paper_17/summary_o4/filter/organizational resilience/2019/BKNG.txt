The report repeatedly underscores the company’s focus on preserving its integrity and performance under adverse conditions, noting for example that “events beyond our control, such as … have previously and may in the future disrupt travel, limit the ability or willingness of travelers … and adversely affect our business,” and that “because these events … are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior … and therefore demand for our services and our relationships with travel service providers,” illustrating the need for positive adjustment under challenging conditions. In response to the coronavirus outbreak, the company explains that “we began … to experience a significant decline in travel demand and increase in customer cancellations … we are working with our travelers and travel service provider partners to address cancellations, requests for refunds, rebookings and similar matters” and “have instructed or allowed employees in high-risk areas to work from home,” demonstrating crisis response, operational flexibility and reconfiguration of workflows. The company details proactive measures such as maintaining “redundant systems and hosting services,” taking “steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems,” expending “significant resources to protect against security breaches,” and using derivative instruments “to minimize the impact of short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,” all of which reflect investments in business continuity, risk mitigation and resilience engineering. It also recalibrates strategic resource allocation by adjusting marketing spend “based on our growth and profitability objectives and the expected ROIs,” and describes an organizational evolution in which “while historically our brands operated on a largely independent basis … we are increasing the collaboration, cooperation and interdependency among our brands,” signaling a systemic perspective and dynamic capabilities. At the same time, the company candidly acknowledges areas for improvement in continuity planning—“we do not have a completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region” and “in the event of certain system failures, we may not be able to switch to back-up systems immediately”—and warns that dependencies on third-party travel service providers and payment processors could “have a material adverse effect” on its ability to sustain operations, thereby highlighting ongoing efforts to absorb strain, adapt to unexpected situations and preserve functioning in a turbulent environment.

The company discloses that its performance under pressure depends on the “efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks” and that it “regularly assesses and takes steps to improve its existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession” to ensure the availability of personnel, facilities and systems in the face of events such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, power loss or terrorist activity. It recognizes that failing to maintain or upgrade technology systems, adapt to digital disruption, execute strategic investments and integrations—such as its “investments in or partnerships with technology companies as well as investments in technology systems and infrastructure”—or secure third-party and newly acquired platforms could result in operational difficulties, additional costs, reputational harm, regulatory actions or significant financial loss. The report outlines risk mitigation measures including access controls, encryption, multi-factor authentication, employee training (including phishing prevention), continuous patching of vulnerabilities, incident response protocols and business interruption insurance, while acknowledging inherent vulnerabilities in legacy systems, cloud migrations, vendor dependencies and the “latency of a compromise,” which can delay detection and recovery. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need to foster organizational health through ethical culture, leadership succession and cross-functional collaboration to sustain agility, preserve performance continuity and maintain system integrity in turbulent markets, thereby supporting the positive adjustment of the organization under challenging and disruptive conditions.

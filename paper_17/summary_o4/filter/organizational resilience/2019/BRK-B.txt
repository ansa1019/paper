Berkshire and its subsidiaries recognize the importance of maintaining operational continuity and adaptive capacity under internal or external pressures; they have instituted succession planning—“the board’s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk”—and continue to monitor the availability of key personnel whose “services … could have a material adverse effect on our operations” should they be unexpectedly unavailable. Their “unusually decentralized basis” for management grants operational flexibility and entrusts day-to-day decisions to subsidiary leaders to manage changes due to “changing business or regulatory environments,” while senior corporate management retains ultimate responsibility for significant capital allocation decisions. The company’s substantial liquidity position, including cash, cash equivalents, Treasury bills and a large statutory surplus, provides a competitive advantage and financial buffer against “deterioration of general economic conditions,” restricted capital markets access or significant declines in investment values. They employ “disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations” to guard against single-catastrophe events, and maintain “business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis” to address cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical disruptions. Risk governance spans diverse areas—from catastrophe-modeling, regulatory compliance adaptations and capital project review to cyber-security countermeasures—yet the approach emphasizes preserving performance, safeguarding stakeholder interests and sustaining resilience through resource allocation, monitoring of “material adverse effects,” and the adaptability needed to “protect and enhance competitive advantages” across its highly diversified operations.

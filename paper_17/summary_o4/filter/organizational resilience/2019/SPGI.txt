The annual report emphasizes that our operations are inherently exposed to internal and external variations and disturbances—ranging from natural and man-made disasters, pandemics, cyber attacks, power or telecommunications failures, to security breaches and other crises—that can introduce volatility, uncertainty and operational challenges across our global capital and commodities markets businesses and adversely affect our performance. We state that our continued functioning under such extreme or exceptional conditions depends on the availability of our personnel, the integrity of our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunications and related systems, and that failure to recover promptly from a regional or localized disaster or business continuity problem could materially interrupt our operations, cause financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm, loss of human capital, damaged client relationships or legal liability. While we regularly assess and enhance our business continuity plans, key management succession processes and cybersecurity measures, we acknowledge that any disruption—whether from insufficient third-party safeguards, system failures, outsourcing provider shortcomings, or disasters on a significant scale—could overwhelm our support systems and crisis response mechanisms, erode customer confidence and impair our ability to preserve or improve organizational functioning under adversity.

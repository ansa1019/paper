TJX’s disclosures reflect a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience, conceived as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, through dynamic capabilities such as operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns, granting merchants discretion to assess market trends and source merchandise at the right times, prices and mixes, flexibly allocating floor space and delivering inventory to meet shifting customer demand, and realigning European supply chains in response to Brexit. The company emphasizes systemic risk mitigation via routine use of inventory-related currency hedges, ongoing investment in information technology systems for planning, purchasing, sales, supply chain management, and data security policies, procedures and controls designed to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks and system disruptions. TJX describes its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid natural disasters, pandemics, economic volatility and regulatory changes by monitoring trends, adjusting operating expenses, reducing capital expenditures, drawing on revolving credit facilities, suspending share repurchases, modifying dividend policies and adhering to emergency measures—closing stores, enabling remote work and committing to pay associates during Covid-19 closures—to ensure business continuity, preserve liquidity and reconfigure trajectories toward future growth.

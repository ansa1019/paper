The Company recognizes that maintaining operational continuity and preserving performance under adverse conditions requires robust capacity planning, redundancy, disaster recovery and risk-mitigation measures across its global infrastructure and supply chains. It notes that “we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities,” and acknowledges that “interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or transmission could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.” To mitigate internal and external pressures—from cybersecurity incidents and disruptive technology developments to evolving privacy regulations and extreme weather events—the Company allocates resources for security controls, emerging-standards readiness (including GDPR and CCPA), product adaptation to new devices and platforms, third-party relationship management, infrastructure scalability, and integration of acquisitions. These strategic initiatives and contingency preparations are intended to absorb strain, preserve integrity, reconfigure operations in response to unexpected disruptions and sustain service levels, customer trust and competitive advantage in a turbulent business environment.

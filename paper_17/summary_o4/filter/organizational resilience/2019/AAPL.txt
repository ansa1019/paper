The Form 10-K identifies reliance on single-source and limited-source outsourcing partners for critical components, manufacturing, assembly, transportation and logistics, and warns that natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes may disrupt production or transit, noting that “system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.” It cautions that such interruptions could require substantial recovery time, significant expenditures to resume operations and materially and adversely affect component supply, product availability, cost structure and financial condition, and that the company “records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand,” reviews “capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable,” and “accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components.” The report details use of derivative instruments—including foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps—to hedge exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, and maintenance of insurance coverage intended to address certain types of claims, while acknowledging such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all claim types. It describes substantial investments in network and data security through encryption, authentication technologies and continuous monitoring for unusual activity, yet recognizes that “losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results,” and that compliance policies and procedures may not prevent violations of complex and changing worldwide laws and regulations. Finally, the company emphasizes “focused investments in research and development” and capital assets, strategic resource allocation through share repurchases, dividend increases and capital return programs, and ongoing management of inventory levels, warranty costs, supply forecasting and product transitions as critical to preserving or improving overall functioning, operational flexibility and competitive advantage under volatile economic, technological, competitive and regulatory disturbances.

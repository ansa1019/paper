Mastercard’s 2019 Form 10-K discloses that regulators worldwide may designate payment networks as “systemically important payment systems” or “critical infrastructure,” imposing expanded oversight of its clearing and settlement activities—including risk management policies and procedures, collateral requirements, participant default procedures, transaction switching capabilities and capital resource requirements—that could fragment operations, constrain resource allocation and limit its ability to innovate under both nominal and exceptional conditions. The company warns that heightened regulation, preferential government actions or foreign ownership restrictions may impose costly compliance burdens, disrupt issuer and merchant participation, reduce transaction volumes and impair its capacity to maintain operational continuity, service innovation and organizational performance amid internal or external variations. Mastercard emphasizes its reliance on a business continuity program designed to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies for technology malfunctions, service outages, natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, data compromise events and third-party disruptions, while acknowledging that such measures may not eliminate the risk of interruption or degradation that could materially and adversely affect its financial results, organizational integrity and reputation. The filing further notes that the acquisition of real-time account-based payment technology has expanded its systemic footprint but also subjects it to critical national infrastructure designations and escalated regulatory and reputational risk in the event of security breaches or service outages, underscoring the need for careful security and operational management to ensure sustained functionality and recovery capabilities. Additionally, Mastercard acknowledges that rapid technological change, competitive disintermediation, shifting customer needs and strategic acquisitions or joint ventures may require continuous reconfiguration of resources, strategic agility and adaptive capabilities to preserve system resilience, protect stakeholder relationships and maintain organizational coherence while pursuing growth and long-term strength.

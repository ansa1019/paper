We maintain comprehensive business continuity and resilience plans to ensure that our critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located, including facilities used by us, our employees or third parties, such as communications, transportation or cloud service providers. We hold substantial unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash—our global core liquid assets—that would be readily convertible to cash within days, enabling us to pre-fund estimated cash and collateral needs without having to sell other assets or rely on credit-sensitive markets. Our contingency funding plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital or liquidity deficiency by identifying drivers of stress, defining mitigants such as term secured financing with staggered maturities, diversified counterparties and excess secured funding, and specifying clear escalation and communication procedures. We manage liquidity risk according to three principles—maintain sufficient excess liquidity, implement conservative asset-liability management and uphold a viable contingency funding plan—and we subject our balance sheet to daily and scenario stress tests, including 30-day and prolonged severely adverse scenarios, to ensure that even in an environment of severely challenged markets and firm-specific crises we remain adequately capitalized and funded. We recognize that failures in our operational systems or those of third parties, cyber-attacks, human error or misconduct, and deficiencies in controls can impair liquidity, disrupt businesses, disclose confidential information and cause losses, so we invest heavily in systemic controls, ongoing system enhancements, information-security programs, third-party risk management and training to support operational flexibility, maintain system integrity and minimize the risk of extended service interruptions. Our operational and model risk frameworks include rigorous event capture, annual self-assessments, independent model validations, periodic reviews of risk limits and thresholds, and scenario-based stress testing to identify, monitor and manage potential losses and to facilitate rapid recovery, transformation and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

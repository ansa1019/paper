Bank of America Corporation maintains a comprehensive enterprise risk framework and formally approved risk appetite statement, which together establish clear roles, responsibilities and limits for measuring, monitoring and controlling the full spectrum of strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks in support of business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The firm employs a documented “identify-measure-monitor-control” process, implements broad and diversified risk mitigation techniques including hedging strategies, regularly conducts capital and liquidity stress testing under both historical and hypothetical scenarios, and maintains contingency funding plans and a preferred single-point-of-entry resolution strategy to ensure access to diverse global liquidity sources.  To bolster its operational resilience, it has invested in training, procedures, backup systems and other safeguards, performed periodic reviews and tests of its contingency plans, and established recovery and resolution planning protocols, including a capital contingency plan and financial recovery plan.  Risk is actively managed board- and committee-level oversight, supported by independent risk management and corporate audit functions, with regular reporting of risk exposures, limit excesses and stress-testing outcomes, all designed to preserve organizational integrity, maintain performance and enable adaptive strategies in the face of internal or external disruptions.

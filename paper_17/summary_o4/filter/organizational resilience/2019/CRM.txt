The Company’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to absorbing strain and preserving operation under adverse conditions by maintaining and improving business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including the ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks, disabling access and remediating issues following service disruptions, and replicating production environments and customer data in near real-time in separate facilities subject to disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements.  The Company acknowledges that “we have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services and such interruptions may occur in the future” and that “these scenarios are not under our control,” whether arising from natural disasters, seismic events, cyber-attacks, employee errors, pandemics or supply-chain constraints.  To reduce brittleness as the business scales, it regularly upgrades or replaces software systems, plans infrastructure capacity requirements, makes significant additional investments to scale operations and increase productivity, and periodically reorganizes its sales and professional services teams.  Expense levels and investments are planned on estimates of future revenue and renewal seasonality, recognizing that “a portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time,” while maintaining a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and disciplined debt management to ensure liquidity and covenant compliance.  In response to the coronavirus epidemic, events were shifted to virtual-only formats and further alterations may be made to customer, employee or industry events.  The Company pursues strategic acquisitions and investments—such as those of Mulesoft, Tableau and ClickSoftware—to reconfigure resources, augment capabilities, integrate new technologies and personnel, and transform its operating model to emerge stronger from disruptive change.

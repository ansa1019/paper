Nvidia identifies business continuity risks stemming from natural disasters, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, cloud service provider outages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters as events that could disrupt operations, reduce revenue, increase costs and require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations. The company depends on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and package its products—relying on foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.—which reduces its control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and delivery schedules and exposes it to risks if suppliers fail to procure raw materials, allocate adequate capacity or prioritize competitors’ orders. Security breaches, malware, phishing and cyber-attacks have occurred on Nvidia’s internal systems and those of its customers, making it increasingly difficult to defend against evolving threats and requiring continuous engineering of more secure products and enhancement of security and reliability features. Nvidia devotes significant technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing resources to research and development to identify emerging industry changes, develop new or enhanced products across gaming, professional visualization, data center and automotive markets, and scale infrastructure including customer service and support, reflecting resource allocation and strategic initiatives aimed at sustaining performance under evolving conditions. Inventory provisioning practices—charging cost of sales for write-downs to the lower of cost or net realizable value or complete write-offs of obsolete or excess inventory—and the sale of previously written-off components have driven gross margin improvements, demonstrating adaptive inventory management under changing demand and technology transitions. With cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $10.90 billion as of January 26, 2020, along with diversified debt instruments and available credit facilities, Nvidia maintains sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, fund planned capital investments and support strategic initiatives including the proposed acquisition of Mellanox, thereby reinforcing financial resilience and mitigating funding risks. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, operations, employees, customers and suppliers in China and neighboring regions experienced shutdowns and travel restrictions, which are expected to have a negative effect on financial results, though the full extent and duration remain uncertain.

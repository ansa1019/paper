The Company’s operations depend on a complex, multi‐step international supply chain in which a majority of manufacturing steps are performed by third‐party contractors, exposing it to disruption risks—such as raw material shortages, labor constraints, technical difficulties, regulatory inspections, shipping or customs delays and reliance on single‐source suppliers—that could interrupt commercial supply, delay clinical trials and materially affect patients, revenues and regulatory timelines. Although the Company seeks to manage these external relationships, it does not control its partners’ operations and has therefore adopted business continuity plans, established disaster recovery procedures for geographically concentrated facilities (including flood‐zone locations) and aims to develop additional sources of manufacture at or shortly after approval. The Company also maintains extensive information technology and network infrastructures to support its global operations and has implemented security measures and continuity plans to address service interruptions, cyber‐attacks or data breaches, but recognizes that the size and complexity of its systems may leave it vulnerable to unforeseen failures with potentially significant operational and financial consequences. Reliance on third parties to conduct preclinical work, clinical trials and manufacturing reduces internal control, may require replacing vendors or repeating trials if performance or compliance falls short and necessitates reallocation of resources and adaptive project management. Rapid expansion of international research and commercial activities has placed significant demands on management and infrastructure, prompting enhancements to corporate‐wide strategy communication, operational and financial controls, cross‐functional decision‐making processes, compliance programs (including health care fraud and abuse, data privacy, pricing and reimbursement regulations), and legal resources to navigate divergent regulatory requirements, evolving privacy and data protection laws, foreign currency volatility, tariff and trade uncertainties, public health emergencies, geopolitical actions and environmental, health and safety regulations for hazardous materials. The Company has procured insurance and established risk management and emergency response mechanisms to address pollution conditions, work‐site hazards and catastrophic events, and it regularly evaluates contingent liabilities arising from collaborative development and regulatory milestones. Its drug discovery and development programs require significant resource allocation among long-lead, resource-intensive clinical trials subject to unanticipated delays, shifting payor mix and reimbursement policies, competitive pressures from new therapies and complex regulatory approval processes that may halt or reprioritize projects. Integration of acquisitions and collaborative arrangements involves system synchronization, transfer and absorption of external knowledge, contingent milestone obligations accounted for at fair value, and potential disruption of ongoing business and personnel, all of which demand strategic agility, absorptive capacity, dynamic capabilities and disciplined change management to maintain performance, preserve system integrity and sustain positive adjustment under internal and external pressures.

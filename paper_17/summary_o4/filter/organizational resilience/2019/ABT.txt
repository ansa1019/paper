Abbott continuously evaluates and executes strategic initiatives to maintain operational flexibility and support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, including acquiring other businesses, licensing technologies, forming alliances, disposing of or spin-off businesses, and undertaking restructuring plans to leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. The company proactively shaped the organization with the strategic intent to deliver sustainable growth by completing material acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere, selling non-core assets such as Abbott Medical Optics, and integrating these businesses through corrective actions and integration programs designed to reconfigure its portfolio and resource deployment. Abbott maintains a systemic perspective on risk mitigation by investing in information technology systems and the protection of its products and data, monitoring its systems on an ongoing basis for threats and regulatory changes, and employing factoring arrangements and allowances to monitor and mitigate credit risk in its receivables. It also manages liquidity and financial resources to support operational continuity under challenging conditions, maintaining unused lines of credit of up to $5 billion, repaying and refinancing debt to optimize its capital structure and maintain investment-grade ratings, and funding defined benefit pension plans while expecting operating cash flows to exceed capital expenditures and dividends. Recognizing the critical role of research and innovation, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development across its medical devices, diagnostics, nutritionals, and established pharmaceuticals segments, and plans to continue investing in product development areas that provide the opportunity for strong sustainable growth. The company further mitigates regulatory and manufacturing risks by ensuring compliance with complex global regulations, implementing corrective action plans in response to FDA observations, and upgrading and expanding manufacturing and R&D facilities and equipment, thereby reinforcing its capacity to adapt to external perturbations, preserve system integrity, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

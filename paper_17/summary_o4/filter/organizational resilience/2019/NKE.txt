Nike’s annual report discloses a broad array of organizational practices and resource commitments that collectively sustain the company’s capacity to maintain operations and adapt under adverse conditions, including explicit recognition of business disruptions, supply-chain delays, climate-related natural disasters, disease outbreaks, political unrest and technology failures as risk factors; formal business continuity plans and business interruption insurance to mitigate interruptions in data and information technology systems, manufacturing and distribution; a centrally managed foreign-exchange risk management program that employs natural offsets, forward contracts and options to lessen the variability of cash flows and earnings arising from currency fluctuations; currency adjustment arrangements with contract factories to share input-cost exposures; diversified sourcing from independent contract manufacturers and contingency commitments with alternative suppliers to preserve product flow; investments in digital commerce, enterprise resource-planning tools and analytics capabilities to support rapid reconfiguration of operations and consumer-direct channels; liquidity commitments in the form of a $2 billion committed credit facility, commercial paper program and robust cash, cash-equivalents and short-term investment portfolio to ensure financial flexibility; structured endorsement and licensing arrangements, property and lease obligations and long-term purchase agreements that secure critical resources; rigorous data security and privacy controls, coupled with incident-response and remediation processes, to preserve system integrity; detailed forecasting and open purchase orders to manage inventory levels and adjust to shifts in consumer demand; credit and hedging arrangements to buffer counterparty defaults; a multi-tiered risk assessment and governance framework that monitors litigation, regulatory proceedings, intellectual property and compliance across jurisdictions; and an enterprise-wide strategy (“consumer direct offense” and “triple double”) that channels investments in innovation, product quality, brand campaigns and operational agility to preserve and enhance performance despite environmental turbulence, competitive pressures and unexpected challenges.

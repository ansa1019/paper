The company discloses that it provides “data backup and disaster recovery services” as part of its subscription offerings and maintains “crisis management and disaster response plans” to safeguard operational continuity in the face of “natural disasters or other catastrophic events,” including pandemics, geopolitical unrest, environmental disruptions and other “events beyond our control,” acknowledging that such events could make it “difficult or impossible” to deliver services, result in customer data loss, require “significant recovery time” and impose substantial expense.  It further recognizes that “customers may have unique requirements for system resiliency that we may not be able to, or may not choose to, meet” and that service availability may be compromised by software defects, denial-of-service attacks or customer-induced disruptions, any of which could damage customer businesses and harm its reputation.  To mitigate these risks, the company “devotes significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures; however, as cyber-security threats develop and grow more complex over time, it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure,” and it describes the challenge that “techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not detected until successfully launched,” limiting its ability to “anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.”  The company also warns that if it “does not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological, market and customer developments,” its competitive position and business prospects “may be harmed,” and it affirms the need to continuously “identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies,” “invest in and continually optimize” its platform, “efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments,” expand its offerings and leverage its partner ecosystem to maintain adaptability, operational flexibility and resilience under changing external pressures.

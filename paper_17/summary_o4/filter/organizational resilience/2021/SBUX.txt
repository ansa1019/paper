Starbucks’ annual report outlines a broad array of strategic, operational and financial actions designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company closed and subsequently reopened company-operated and licensed stores under modified operating hours and protocols amid resurgences and variants, adjusted store formats, and accelerated alternative channels such as mobile ordering, delivery and curbside pickup to address reduced customer traffic and maintain service continuity. Supply chain risk—particularly the availability and cost volatility of coffee, dairy and other commodities—is managed through diversified sourcing, fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts, hedging activities and enhanced oversight of third-party suppliers and licensees. Incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, supported by significant investments in technology, redundancy and operational safeguards, aim to anticipate and minimize interruptions from system failures, cyber-attacks and natural or man-made hazards. Financial resilience is maintained via access to revolving credit facilities, a commercial paper program, debt issuances and interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate market risks and ensure compliance with covenants. Labor and partner management initiatives—including enhanced wages, benefits, training and coordination of global operations—seek to attract and retain talent amid evolving health guidelines and labor constraints. The Company’s profit-, people- and planet-positive strategic agenda, encompassing international expansion, licensed store model shifts, menu innovation and climate-related sustainability commitments, reflects a systemic approach to reconfiguring resources, mitigating risks and sustaining performance under challenging conditions.

The Company discloses that it has reconfigured its operations and resource allocations to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including pandemic-driven economic instability, cybersecurity threats and natural or man-made disasters, by shifting nearly all employees to work-from-home environments and evolving to a hybrid workplace model; by reorganizing its technology and customer-success functions at the corporate level; by investing in high-availability public cloud infrastructure and disaster recovery planning (despite recognizing that not all eventualities can be anticipated); by securing ISO 27001 certification for critical systems; by imposing strict controls and due diligence over third-party vendors and open-source components; and by implementing enhanced security protections, anti-fraud measures and continuous monitoring to absorb internal and external variations. It further emphasizes its ability to handle extreme seasonal demand—particularly during peak tax‐filing periods—through robust capacity planning and customer support investments (including quickbooks live and turbotax live), and it maintains ample liquidity, supported by cash from operations, credit facilities and marketable investments, to fund debt service, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions (such as Credit Karma), and other commitments. These measures collectively reflect a systemic perspective on organizational resilience—preserving system integrity and performance under pressures, adapting to regulatory and workplace disruptions, deploying resources to ensure continuity of service and compliance, and reconstituting future growth trajectories to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

Nextera Energy and FPL articulate a multifaceted resilience framework enabling the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by utilizing regulatory cost recovery mechanisms—such as fuel cost recovery clauses, base rates, deferral of storm restoration costs and reserve amortization—to offset incremental storm and restoration expenditures and preserve operational continuity; by investing in storm restoration and nuclear decommissioning funds, maintaining insurance coverage and holding $10.6 billion of available liquidity from operating cash flows, borrowings, debt issuances, credit facilities, letters of credit and surety bonds to absorb financial strain; by deploying operational flexibility through management of planned and unplanned outages, load shedding, fuel diversification and project development contingencies; by employing energy marketing and trading hedges and trading procedures with separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems to mitigate commodity, interest rate and currency risks; and by reconfiguring resources and reinforcing financial and capital resilience via strategic divestitures, differential membership interest sales and acquisitions—including Gulf Power and GridLiance—thus enabling adaptation to severe weather, regulatory and market perturbations, ensuring recovery and performance maintenance under adverse conditions, and supporting the company’s ability to absorb disturbances, reconstitute investment trajectories and transform itself to emerge stronger.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on maintaining a supply of our medicines, reducing strain on healthcare systems, developing COVID-19 therapies, protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees, supporting our communities, and ensuring the affordability of and access to our medicines, including at-risk investments in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies to ensure rapid global patient access; as the pandemic evolves, we may adjust in-person interactions with healthcare professionals in compliance with applicable guidance, while managing the resulting strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets that has increased costs and caused supply disruptions. We continue to implement measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent IT system inadequacies, security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other compromises of our systems, supported by cyber liability insurance and a corporate risk-management policy that defines minimum and maximum hedge coverage for interest rate and foreign currency exposures, with the objective of limiting the impact of fluctuations on our earnings. To manage interest rate risk, we seek an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt and use interest rate swaps, and to manage foreign currency risk we enter into forward and option contracts and periodically analyze their sensitivity to exchange-rate changes; we also maintain committed bank credit facilities and access to commercial paper markets to ensure adequate liquidity and operational continuity. We manage research and development spending across our pipeline so that delays or terminations of individual projects do not materially alter total spending, and we continuously evaluate our available cash, cash equivalents, and borrowing capacity to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements, while recognizing integration and execution risks that may affect the realization of anticipated benefits. Our reliance on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers, clinical research organizations, distributors, and IT service providers for selected aspects of product and clinical development, manufacturing, commercialization, and information technology hosting exposes us to risks that they may not meet performance, regulatory, confidentiality, or quality standards; we seek to mitigate these risks through contractual obligations, oversight, and alternative sourcing strategies. We regularly review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, for impairment indicators, and we consider events such as changes in demand, supply-chain disruptions, and regulatory developments in estimating recoverable cash flows. We evaluate our retirement benefit obligations, applying assumptions for discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, and retirement ages, and we monitor tax positions and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, environmental matters, and intellectual property disputes, recognizing that changes in these areas could affect our financial position. Collectively, these strategies and practices reflect our ability to anticipate, absorb, and adapt to internal and external pressures, disruptions, and adverse conditions, preserving our integrity and performance under challenging and uncertain circumstances.

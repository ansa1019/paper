In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to focus on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business, monitoring developments such as new variant strains and government responses. The transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases our customers’ resiliency and security and delivers additional value to their employees and consumers. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, flooding, fire, power shortages, pandemics, terrorism, political unrest, telecommunications failures, vandalism, cyber-attacks, geopolitical instability, war, the effects of climate change and other events beyond our control; although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could impede service delivery, decrease demand for our services and result in substantial expense. We seek to mitigate business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks. Global economic conditions—such as inflation, interest-rate fluctuations, economic uncertainty, political instability, changes in laws, trade barriers and sanctions—may harm our industry, business and results of operations. We devote significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures and a data governance framework designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss, while acknowledging that evolving cyber-security threats, human error or vulnerabilities in code may pose residual risk despite our preventative efforts. Subscription services arrangements typically have multi-year terms and we have achieved renewal rates of 98% over the last three years, supporting continuity of revenue and operational planning. We generate positive operating cash flows, which, together with cash, cash equivalents and investments, are expected to meet our liquidity needs and fund strategic investments in capital, data-center expansion, workforce and acquisitions necessary to support our ongoing resilience and growth.

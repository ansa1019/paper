The company’s risk disclosures and financial discussion reveal multiple practices and resources that support its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Its compliance programs and policies are designed to support adherence to a wide array of evolving global regulations, and it continually enhances these programs as regulations evolve to mitigate potential operational disruptions. The firm acknowledges that “if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services, fees and other important aspects of our business in the regions where we operate,” underscoring its need for operational flexibility and strategic adaptation. To counter cyber-attacks and system failures, the company “devotes significant resources to our cybersecurity, acquired entities, and supplier risk management programs” and “has implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents,” reflecting its crisis-response and recovery capabilities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it “remains in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times,” “is taking a phased approach to reopening our offices” with most employees “currently working remotely,” and “will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business,” which demonstrates its business-continuity planning, future orientation, and inter-organizational collaboration. Its treasury policies “provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk,” ensuring “adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios,” timely settlement of client transactions, planned capital investments, dividend payments and the investment of excess cash in readily marketable securities—activities that exemplify resource allocation, risk mitigation, and system integrity under internal or external disturbances. The company maintains a commercial paper program, an unsecured revolving credit facility and a dedicated litigation escrow account to guarantee settlements and fund legal liabilities, and “regularly review global settlement risk policies and procedures” that may require clients to post collateral, illustrating its systemic perspective on risk management. It also invests in technology assets and payments-system infrastructure to support its digital solutions and core business initiatives, preserving its competitive advantage and resilience against disruptive change. Finally, the firm emphasizes the importance of sustaining and growing complex relationships with financial institutions, merchants, fintechs, processors and other third parties; balancing their interests; and upholding the value of its globally recognized brand—as well as maintaining trust, reliability and security—to fortify its organizational health, adaptability and performance under pressure.

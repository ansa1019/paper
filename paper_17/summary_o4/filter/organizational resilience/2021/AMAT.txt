Applied has demonstrated its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a multi-phase plan to return to on-site work that gradually allows additional workers while practicing social distancing and other safety measures, coupled with enhanced health-screenings and remote-work flexibility, all of which support business continuity and organizational health amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  The company continually monitors local government regulations, community case trends and public health guidance to reconfigure its operational parameters and workforce deployment, and it absorbs strain by diverting production among alternative suppliers in response to supply-chain interruptions or capacity constraints and by adjusting capital and human resources via voluntary retirement programs and targeted workforce reductions.  Applied sustains financial resilience through diversified global operations, agreements to sell accounts receivable or discount letters of credit, a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility with up to $2.0 billion availability, a back-stopped commercial paper program, and an investment portfolio designed to mitigate market and liquidity risks.  Ongoing research, development and engineering investments in etch, deposition, inspection, patterning, packaging and other process technologies reinforce the companyâ€™s competitive advantage and dynamic capabilities, while enterprise resource planning and information-systems enhancements align global organizations to enable future growth.  Strategic initiatives, including disciplined acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, a $7.5 billion stock repurchase authorization and a consistent dividend program, are guided by risk assessment, due diligence and impact-management processes that preserve system integrity and enable transformation.  Through proactive resource allocation, operational flexibility, service innovation and close customer collaboration, Applied strives to absorb external pressures, maintain or improve performance under disruption, and emerge stronger from adverse conditions.

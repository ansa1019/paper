The company identifies a broad range of risks and uncertainties—“market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns including pandemics, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions”—that may impair its business, underscoring the need for business continuity and risk mitigation.  It acknowledges that “our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19,” which “has led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities,” including quarantines, border closures and travel restrictions that “can disrupt normal business operations and can have significant negative impacts on businesses” by causing “constraints on the movement of our products through the supply chain,” “capacity constraints and price increases in our own supply chain,” “adverse impacts on our workforce and/or key employees including labor availability,” “adverse impacts on customer orders and purchases and unpredictable reductions in demand,” and “adverse impacts on our collections of accounts receivable.”  Even assuming improvements, the company warns that “continuing adverse impacts and/or the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and line of business” and that actions taken “with incomplete information … may prove to be premature, incorrect or insufficient,” adversely affecting results.  To sustain organizational functioning under such adversity, the company reports activating business continuity plans, implementing “return-to-workplace protocols,” expanding and reallocating manufacturing capacity—including pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act—and making significant capital expenditures to increase capacity for diagnostic testing and biopharma products.  It has entered government-funded agreements for incremental capacity and related technology, accepts that “accelerated development and production … increases the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or claims thereof,” and concedes that “system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate” against cyber-attacks, power outages, hardware failures, natural catastrophes and other unforeseen events.  The company underscores supply chain fragmentation risks—“sole or limited sources of supply,” “supplier capacity constraints,” “trade protectionism,” “natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes”—and the need to “adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required … to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand” through productivity improvement initiatives, noncancelable purchase commitments and restructuring actions that “reduce our available talent, assets and other resources” yet aim to preserve or improve performance.  It highlights labor availability constraints and labor cost inflation as factors requiring adaptive resource allocation and human capital management.  Recognizing that regulatory developments can “delay introduction of new or modified products,” the company emphasizes continuous monitoring of competitors and customers, geographic and industry diversification to “help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country,” and strategic investments, acquisitions and inter-organizational collaborations designed to maintain integrity and performance despite external pressures, illustrating a systemic perspective on resilience strategies and future-oriented risk assessment.

The 10-K discloses that Schwab has established an enterprise risk management framework, approved by the board and overseen by a global risk committee, which integrates purpose, vision, and values to sustain operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by identifying, measuring, and controlling operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks through policies, procedures, internal controls, risk appetite limits, and governance processes. The company maintains business continuity and disaster recovery plans, routine testing of incident management programs, geographically dispersed backup facilities, cloud and outsourced service providers under ongoing monitoring and contractual provisions, and robust information security and cybersecurity programs that include advanced monitoring systems, employee training, and proactive intrusion detection to protect client data and systems. In response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, Schwab reallocated internal knowledge and resources to support remote work, hired additional client service employees, streamlined call routing and online self-service capabilities, and managed staffing shortages at outsourced service providers to preserve service quality during heightened client engagement. Schwab’s liquidity and capital management approach employs regular stress testing, simulated interest-rate scenarios, a capital contingency plan for low-probability, high-impact events, contingency funding sources including unsecured and secured credit lines, repurchase agreements, and discount window access, and ongoing monitoring of the liquidity coverage ratio to ensure sufficient liquidity under both normal and stressed conditions. The firm actively manages interest-rate sensitivity by adjusting balance-sheet composition, has phased out Libor by transitioning financial models and contract fallback provisions to alternative rates, and aligns risk management practices across its recent acquisitions to reconfigure technology platforms and preserve organizational performance under stress. Schwab mitigates fraud risk, anti-money-laundering risk, privacy risk, model risk, and conduct risk through daily monitoring, risk-based procedures, internal testing, and oversight committees, and its incentive compensation risk program reinforces prudent risk-taking and alignment with long-term objectives. These multifaceted resilience strategies—encompassing contingency planning, dynamic capabilities, organizational flexibility, inter-organizational collaboration, and strategic agility—are designed to absorb strain, preserve system integrity, and maintain or improve functioning despite adverse and evolving market, regulatory, and operational disturbances.

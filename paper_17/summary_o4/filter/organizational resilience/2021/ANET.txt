The annual report describes how the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the company’s ability to maintain business continuity, noting “manufacturing disruptions, supply chain shortages and unpredictable product demand and supply,” “increased lead times, extended demand planning horizons and increased purchase commitments,” and governmental “shelter in place orders, workforce disruptions, delays and increased costs for production, transit and the import and export of products,” all of which “could materially adversely affect our business.” In response, the company “extended our demand planning horizon,” “increased our purchase commitments and component buffer inventories,” issued “purchase orders for components and products that are non-cancellable and non-returnable,” and recorded “liabilities for non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete,” thereby reallocating resources to buffer against further disruptions. The report emphasizes the complexity of managing supply of products and components—“insufficient component supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins”—and the firm’s reliance on third-party contract manufacturers “to manufacture our product lines,” which reduces its control over “manufacturing process, quality assurance, product costs and product supply and timing.” It also highlights the dynamic need to forecast demand accurately, regularly evaluate “excess or obsolete inventory” provisions, and collaborate closely with contract manufacturers and suppliers, as well as adapt to “government restrictions on access” and geopolitical pressures such as “trade wars” and “tariffs,” all of which serve as risk-mitigation and resilience strategies to preserve or improve the company’s functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances.

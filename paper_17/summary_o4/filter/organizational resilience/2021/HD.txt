Our regulatory disclosures explain that the coordinated operation of our network of physical stores, distribution facilities, and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our interconnected strategy and that we continue to invest strategically in our supply chain and information technology systems to streamline operations, simplify customer interactions, and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network, thereby enabling the organization to adapt to shifting customer expectations, evolving competitive pressures, and logistical disruptions. We acknowledge that a failure to choose, fund, or implement the right investments, processes, technologies, and real estate projects at the appropriate pace or scale could disrupt our operations and materially affect our financial performance, and that interruptions arising from natural disasters, pandemics, cyber-attacks, infrastructure outages, labor shortages, trade restrictions, civil unrest, or other external pressures could impair our ability to receive, manage, or deliver inventory, operate critical IT systems, maintain customer-facing sales channels, or engage associates, which in turn could adversely impact demand for our products, our brand reputation, and our operational continuity. We recognize that safeguarding customer, associate, and company information against evolving security threats, maintaining compliance with changing data privacy and cybersecurity laws, and continually evaluating and adapting our systems and processes are key to preserving business continuity and organizational effectiveness. We further disclose that disruptions to our logistics or third-party service providers, unexpected fluctuations in consumer behavior, or challenges in identifying and retaining qualified associates and leadership can lead to higher costs, out-of-stock positions, and modifications to our operations, while our financial resilience is underpinned by our cash flow from operations, access to capital markets, disciplined capital allocation framework, and the ability to adjust capital expenditures to support ongoing strategic initiatives and respond to the economic environment. In addition, we outline extensive risk scenarios associated with the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic—such as variable governmental measures, health and safety requirements, supply chain pressures, remote work infrastructure, workforce availability, and litigation exposure—emphasizing that these factors may persist and evolve, requiring proactive measures, resource reallocation, and adaptive strategies to maintain integrity and performance in the face of adversity.

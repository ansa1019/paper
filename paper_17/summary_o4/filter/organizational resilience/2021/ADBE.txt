In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company modified its business practices, including implementing prolonged closures and limited reopenings of certain Adobe offices, restricting employee travel and, beginning in June 2021, initiating a phased reopening of U.S. and select international offices on a voluntary basis, which has required additional investments in the design, implementation and enforcement of new workplace health and safety protocols; we have offered, and plan to continue to offer, a significant percentage of our employees flexibility in the amount of time they work in an office and have continued to host virtual-only customer, employee and industry events, recognizing that such efforts may present operational, cybersecurity and workplace culture challenges. Authorities throughout the world have implemented containment measures—physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closures of non-essential businesses, quarantines, work-from-home directives, mask requirements, shelter-in-place orders and vaccination programs—that have caused business slowdowns or shutdowns regionally and globally, impacted the provisioning of our offerings, and may delay operations or require temporary re-closure of certain offices; as we continue to monitor evolving public health guidance, we may adjust our policies and practices further, and existing and new precautionary measures may negatively affect our operations. Our operations have also been negatively affected by external factors not within our control, including surges of COVID-19 cases (and more transmissible variants), macroeconomic effects that may persist indefinitely, and supply chain disruptions for hardware needed to maintain third-party systems and services. We rely on Adobe-managed and third-party data centers to host and deliver our services and maintain disaster recovery plans that may not account for all eventualities; if transitions among data centers or service providers encounter unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions despite precautions, or if hardware or software failures occur, we may experience data loss or corruption, fail to meet committed service levels or violate regulatory notification requirements, all of which could impair our delivery of products and services, harm our reputation and result in financial liabilities. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities—through code hardening, rigorous penetration tests, deployment of updates, regular audits against independent security control frameworks, mandatory security training and improved incident response time—yet recognize that cyber-threats are constantly evolving and sophisticated, and that security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated; actual or perceived breaches could disrupt operations, expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations or fines, and damage our brand. We acknowledge that catastrophic events—major earthquakes, fires, floods, tsunamis, pandemics, wildfires resulting in power shut-offs, cyber-attacks, terrorism or other weather events—pose risks to our network infrastructure, enterprise applications and critical business operations, and that climate-related events and environmental resource constraints have the potential to disrupt our business, drive higher attrition and impose additional costs to maintain or resume operations.

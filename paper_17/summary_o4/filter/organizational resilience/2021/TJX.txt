In response to the COVID-19 pandemic’s significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we implemented new practices and protocols—including enhanced cleaning protocols, occupancy limitations and additional health and safety protocols—while continuing to incur expenses and adapt operations to evolving governmental restrictions. Market conditions and pandemic-related disruptions in the global economy and supply chain have interrupted and increased costs for our suppliers and logistics providers, necessitating changes to our operations and affecting our ability to allocate, deliver and maintain preferred inventory mix and levels in our stores, which we manage through frequent inventory turns, lean inventory levels, sales forecasts and an opportunistic buying strategy that places considerable discretion with our merchants to obtain the right merchandise at the right times, quantities, prices and mix. To respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns, we flexibly allocate floor space among product categories and expand or contract merchandise categories in alignment with consumer trends and preferences, although failure to execute our strategy in an effective or timely way could adversely affect our customer traffic, sales and margins. The substantial size and scale of our operations, multiple banners and geographic diversity increase the complexity of information sharing and oversight of internal resources and third-party providers across administration, systems, merchandising, sourcing, store operations, distribution, logistics and compliance, a challenge exacerbated when portions of our workforce work remotely. Our reliance on information technology systems to manage planning; purchasing; point-of-sale processing and e-commerce; supply chain management; inventory management; financial management; and legal and regulatory compliance requires us to accurately anticipate current and future IT needs, develop, implement and maintain appropriate systems and disaster recovery plans, and invest continuously in IT security workforce, technologies and processes to reduce the risk of compromises, disruptions or data security incidents. We depend on strong cash flows from operations, supplemented by short-term bank borrowings, commercial paper and long-term debt facilities, to fund our operations, growth, capital expenditures—including investments to expand distribution capacity and support new stores, renovations and systems—stock repurchases, dividends and interest and debt repayments, and we actively monitor debt financing markets, liquidity sources and credit ratings, prepay or redeem debt when advantageous, negotiate rent deferrals and manage working capital, including merchandise inventories net of accounts payable, to preserve liquidity. We routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments and fuel hedges to mitigate the impact of currency exchange and transportation cost fluctuations on merchandise margins, although mark-to-market adjustments in periods of significant currency volatility can materially affect reported cost of sales and operating margins. Our growth strategy—encompassing expansion within current markets, entry into new geographies, product lines and channels, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures and the launch of e-commerce platforms—requires effective staffing, training and development of an increased number of associates, robust change management, succession planning and the ability to integrate or close businesses without disrupting core operations. We maintain policies, procedures and controls designed to reduce legal, regulatory and compliance risks across labor and employment, product quality and safety, international trade, environmental sustainability, data privacy and security, and ESG matters, recognizing that incidents or perceived inaction can erode trust or confidence and adversely affect our reputation, customer loyalty, vendor relationships, associate engagement and financial results. Collectively, these strategies, processes, capabilities and investments support the partial maintenance and continuous adjustment of our organizational integrity and performance when confronted with internal and external pressures, unexpected conditions or disruptive events.

Berkshire and its subsidiaries have established a range of resilience‐enhancing processes and capabilities designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances.  These include business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to maintain operations in the face of cyber, terrorist, biological, nuclear or chemical attacks; disciplined underwriting practices, diversified reinsurance structures and scenario analyses that seek to mitigate potential losses from correlated catastrophe events; maintenance of substantial cash, cash equivalents and Treasury bill holdings to ensure financial strength and redundant liquidity rather than pursuing yield at the expense of safety; a succession plan for key executives and a highly decentralized operating model that entrusts qualified managers with capital allocation and decision making across numerous distinct business units; and ongoing investments in productivity improvements, system velocity enhancements and critical capital projects in its railroad and utilities businesses to secure service continuity amid severe weather, supply‐chain constraints and regulatory changes.  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, these mechanisms supported significant recoveries in revenues and earnings across its diverse operations, even as pandemic‐related closures, workforce disruptions, supply‐chain volatility, shifting customer demand and higher input costs tested the Company’s ability to adapt, reconfigure resources and partially maintain performance under exceptional conditions.

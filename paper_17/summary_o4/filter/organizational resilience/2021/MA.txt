Mastercard’s business continuity measures include risk management policies and procedures, collateral requirements, participant default policies and procedures, the ability to complete timely switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resource requirements, all of which are designed to preserve transaction processing and settlement integrity under evolving legal and operational pressures. The expansion of its products and services as part of its multi-rail strategy has created the need to obtain new types and increasing numbers of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional compliance burdens distinct from those imposed on its core network activities, and underscoring its adaptive allocation of resources in fragmented regulatory environments. The global COVID-19 pandemic has prompted modifications to business practices—including employee travel restrictions, changes to work locations, and remote or hybrid work environments—and ongoing monitoring to take further actions as required, reflecting an agile response framework to exceptional conditions. Recognizing the importance of system resilience, the company maintains an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies, and continues to invest significant additional resources to modify or enhance its protective measures and remediate information security vulnerabilities as cyber-threats evolve. Mastercard further emphasizes service innovation and operational flexibility in response to rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing customer and consumer needs by continually developing complex multi-rail solutions and diversifying its integrated products and services, while robust liquidity management, access to credit facilities and guaranteed settlement obligations support its ability to absorb financial strain and preserve functioning across global operations amid economic and market volatility.

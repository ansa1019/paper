The Company’s 2021 Form 10-K repeatedly describes measures and capabilities that serve to maintain “positive adjustment under challenging conditions,” reflecting an implicit organizational resilience framework in which business continuity, crisis response and adaptive strategies preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.  In particular, the report details how the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and related macroeconomic pressures have triggered operational flexibility measures—site shutdown protocols, workplace disruptions management, health-and-safety controls and a global crisis management team—to protect employee health, secure supply chains and sustain manufacturing capacity.  The Company highlights its establishment of a medical advisory group, accelerated deployment of remote-work infrastructure and remote physician support, and the use of science-based return-to-office strategies as evidence of systemic perspective, risk mitigation and reconfiguring of resources to meet unexpected situations.  Liquidity management, cost-reduction and reinvestment programs, credit facility amendments and supply-chain network optimization under its restructuring and optimization initiatives further illustrate how resource allocation and strategic initiatives enable recovery and future orientation.  Investments in research and development, cybersecurity controls, compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks (such as EU MDR implementation), and its “C3” energy-management strategy underscore its multifaceted approach to preserving system integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disruptions, whether nominal, extreme or exceptional.

Accenture warns that its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions may be impaired if it is unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with a global workforce of over 624,000 employees, as its size and scale create significant risks to business continuity and firm performance.  The company acknowledges that as it grows and evolves, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise, to institutionalize knowledge, and to timely change strategy, operations or culture.  It further recognizes that sustaining its culture, managing and monitoring personnel and operations, and communicating core values, policies, procedures, strategies and goals—particularly given widespread remote work driven by the COVID-19 pandemic—are essential to preserve system integrity and operational flexibility.  Despite efforts to train employees and maintain internal controls, misconduct or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information could disrupt its operations and competitive advantage.  Accordingly, Accenture emphasizes the need to develop and implement robust processes, tools and controls to manage the enterprise and instill culture and core values across all employees to mitigate risks and uphold organizational resilience.  The company also highlights that changes to its operating model, and the successful integration of acquisitions—each requiring dedicated management attention, resource allocation, alignment of structure and culture, and enhanced financial reporting, disclosure and cyber-security procedures—are critical to avoid operational fragmentation and ensure sustained performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.  Finally, Accenture notes that entering new markets without prior experience and the potential loss of key executives, employees, customers, suppliers or other partners may divert resources, drive additional costs and impede its ability to absorb strain and emerge stronger from future disruptions.

Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment, although there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions. The company continually assesses and adapts its manufacturing network, recognizing that its highly exacting and complex processes can be affected by equipment malfunctions, deviations from specific protocols and procedures, global supply chain interruptions, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and environmental factors, any of which could lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations and time and expense spent investigating the cause. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott mobilized teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch diagnostic tests, realigned its global operations with evolving government orders and guidelines, took aggressive steps to limit virus exposure and enhance facility safety, managed volatile demand and supply chain constraints, and implemented price increases and gross margin improvement initiatives to mitigate inflationary pressures, achieving to date the ability to meet customer demand without significant supply disruption. The company maintains readily available financial resources, including unused revolving credit lines supporting up to $5 billion of unsecured borrowings, regularly monitors customer credit risk, country risk and other forward-looking indicators, and drives working capital optimization and strong cash flow generation—net cash from operating activities amounted to $10.5 billion in 2021—to preserve operational flexibility, ensure business continuity and support strategic growth investments in a dynamic and challenging environment.

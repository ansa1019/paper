In response to the ongoing global Covid-19 outbreak, we have taken measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus and minimize the risk to our employees, channel partners, end-customers, and the communities in which we operate, including transitioning our employee population to work remotely from home beginning in March 2020, continuously monitoring the situation, and adjusting our policies as public health guidance evolves. While these precautionary measures may negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales and marketing activities, and supply chain operations, we have reprioritized our engineering and research and development efforts and made changes to our original offering roadmap to address changes in demand, and we continue to expand and improve our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently in the face of rapid growth and complexity. We rely on a diversified revenue model with subscription and support offerings recognized ratably over service periods to smooth volatility arising from extended sales cycles, credit constraints, and shifting end-customer priorities, and we have invested in cloud hosting service costs, professional services, and channel partner training to maintain service continuity and customer satisfaction. Our risk management practices encompass global supply chain resilience—managing component forecasts, purchase commitments, and sole-source supplier risks—foreign currency hedging, cybersecurity defenses, and customer financing programs, reflecting our commitment to maintain organizational integrity, operational flexibility, and performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

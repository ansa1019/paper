The Company’s Form 10-K discloses that its organizational resilience rests on its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid unprecedented internal and external variations, notably the COVID-19 pandemic’s curtailment of business activities, weakened economic conditions, supply chain disruptions and volatility in global financial markets, with future impacts on operations, liquidity and customer demand remaining difficult to predict and largely outside its control. In response, the Company emphasizes mitigation and adaptation strategies including fuel surcharges and hedging transactions to address energy price fluctuations, dynamic pricing and product-mix adjustments to protect revenue quality, investment in information technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to counter cyber threats and system disruptions, and remote-work protocols to sustain operating effectiveness under workforce constraints. It highlights disciplined capital allocation and resource deployment—through forecasting and adjustment of capital expenditures across aircraft, vehicles, facilities and technology; the divestiture of UPS Freight and reinvestment of proceeds to reduce indebtedness; and the acquisition of Roadie to enhance same-day delivery capabilities—designed to reconfigure its integrated air and ground network, expand capacity and foster service innovation. The Company further discloses its reliance on supply chain finance programs to support suppliers, continuous refinement of cost allocation methodologies, strategic initiatives within its “customer first, people led, innovation driven” framework, and balanced use of debt issuance, repayments, pension plan remeasurements and share repurchases to maintain financial integrity. Finally, the 10-K acknowledges ongoing exposures to severe weather, geopolitical uncertainty, regulatory and legislative changes, labor and collective bargaining challenges, competitive pressures and litigation risks, and underscores its use of contingency planning, risk assessment and organizational change processes to sustain continuity, enable adaptation and emerge stronger from adverse conditions.

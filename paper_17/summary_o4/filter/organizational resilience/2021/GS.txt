The report discloses a comprehensive framework for sustaining continuity of operations and preserving performance under adverse conditions, including the activation of a firmwide business continuity plan (“bcp”) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, managed by a central team to safeguard employees and ensure uninterrupted client service, and the maintenance of robust systems and infrastructure that have supported uninterrupted business activity despite widescale remote working. It describes the role of a firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee in overseeing operational risk, ensuring business and operational resilience, and integrating business continuity, crisis management and recovery strategies. In liquidity management, the firm holds significant unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (“gcla”) to meet potential outflows in stressed scenarios, applies a contingency funding plan to respond to liquidity crises, dynamically manages its asset-liability profile, and conducts regular stress testing and scenario analyses over short- and long-term horizons. In capital management, the firm uses forward-looking stress tests, a resolution capital adequacy framework and triggers and alerts to project potential capital needs and preserve capital buffers under severely adverse scenarios. Market risk is managed through value-at-risk, sensitivity analyses and scenario testing to identify and mitigate losses from market moves, while credit risk management employs independent reviews, credit ratings, collateral agreements and stress tests to absorb credit shocks. A three-line-of-defense model, a comprehensive control framework and an independent Model Risk Management function further support the firm’s ability to adapt, reconfigure and recover from internal or external disruptions and to maintain integrity and performance in the face of operational failures, cyber threats, third-party disruptions and geopolitical or environmental perturbations.

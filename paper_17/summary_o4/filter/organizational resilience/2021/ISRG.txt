Our annual report recognizes that our global operations face internal and external variations—ranging from public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic to single-source component shortages and geopolitical or regulatory disruptions—that could materially affect our business continuity, resource deployment, operational flexibility, and overall organizational health. We experienced interruptions to our supply chains, manufacturing sites, distribution networks, and on-site services as a result of preventive measures, shelter-in-place orders, travel restrictions, facility closures and workforce constraints, which in turn caused us to adjust purchase-order coverage and inventory levels, scale manufacturing capacity, and verify the quality and regulatory compliance of alternative suppliers. To mitigate credit, operational and financial risks under these unexpected conditions, we deployed flexible capital-acquisition approaches such as operating leases and usage-based arrangements, improved communications with sole and single-source suppliers, and implemented new payment terms and service-fee credits for customers under strain. We also invested in digital and hybrid support models—remote service, telepresence mentoring, augmented-reality visualization, and enhanced work-from-home and cyber-security protocols—to reconfigure our organizational practices for continuity and to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. These resilience strategies, including rigorous risk assessment, emergency management planning, and ongoing adaptation of our information technology, supply chain, and customer financing mechanisms, are designed to maintain system integrity and performance in challenging conditions and to position us to reconstitute and transform in response to evolving pressures.

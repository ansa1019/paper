“In our risk factors, we note that “the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and may continue to impact us in the future,” and that “the COVID-19 pandemic also caused us to modify our workforce practices, such as having the vast majority of our employees working from home,” while our “efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful… and could result in disruptions among our employees.” Supply-chain resilience descriptions include reliance on “alternate suppliers,” planning for “natural disasters, the effects of climate change or geopolitical conflicts impacting our suppliers,” health crises and cyber-attacks, and the need to “establish alternate suppliers for certain technologies,” recognizing that “a failure by our suppliers to allocate adequate manufacturing, assembly or test capacity… could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand.” We describe operational flexibility and risk mitigation through “multi-year capacity commitments,” diversification into “new and expanded product areas,” and transformation initiatives such as acquisitions of NUVIA and the planned acquisition of Veoneer, which require us “to transition to new business models and transform aspects of our organization.” Within our management’s discussion, we observe that securing liquidity through “cash generated from operations,” equity investments and a revolving credit facility supports business continuity, and that a significant portion of our cash is allocated to research and development in pursuit of technological leadership and adaptability. We commit to strategic foresight via evolving our patent portfolio, engaging in joint ventures, revising licensing practices, and maintaining “deferred compensation obligations” to preserve organizational health under external pressures and uncertainties.

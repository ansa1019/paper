In its annual report, the company describes multiple risk mitigation measures and operational capabilities that implicitly support organizational resilience by enabling maintenance of functioning and performance under internal and external disturbances.  It maintains and improves business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, with regular briefings to its board, cybersecurity committee and executive management on policy and event updates, notwithstanding its acknowledgment that absolute security cannot be guaranteed.  Its multi-tenant cloud services depend on third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and a fragmented internet infrastructure, and the company warns that breaches, network outages, natural disasters, supply-chain disruptions, system vulnerabilities or pandemic-related events could interrupt service delivery, harm customer operations and damage its reputation; to mitigate these risks, customer data and production environments are replicated in near real time at geographically separate facilities and supported by disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, even though these facilities are not under its control.  The company further cautions that failure to plan accurately for infrastructure capacity or to integrate acquired technologies and migrations effectively may cause performance degradation or outages, financial liabilities and customer attrition, and that strains on personnel resources, emerging service complexity and periodic organizational changes—such as sales organization restructurings and extended enterprise sales cycles—may strain scalability, productivity and organizational health despite ongoing investments in data center capacity, security measures and professional support services to facilitate customer adoption.  It also recognizes that external pressures—including evolving privacy and industry regulations, geopolitical and economic turbulence, climate change hazards and public health emergencies—may disrupt operations or require significant resource allocation and strategic adaptations; accordingly, it has launched a “success from anywhere” workplace model, instituted crisis management and disaster response plans, and continues to allocate resources toward forecasting, risk assessment, operational flexibility and recovery mechanisms to preserve integrity, maintain performance and emerge stronger from adverse conditions.

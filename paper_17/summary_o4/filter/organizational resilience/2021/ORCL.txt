Our 10-K describes how we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks beyond our control or prediction and emphasizes our need to maintain business continuity through risk mitigation strategies, including our critical accounting policies and management’s discussion of external pressures. The report details the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that our “operations have been negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic,” that “preventative measures led to sharp reductions in demand,” and that “if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed.” It further discloses how “we cancelled some customer events and transformed others … to virtual events,” while acknowledging that “our shift to creating virtual customer events may not be successful” and that delays in customer purchasing decisions and payments have occurred. Supply-chain resilience is addressed by noting that “we continue to explore additional third-party manufacturing partners to drive supply chain continuity” in the face of supplier constraints, natural disasters, political unrest and public health crises. Workforce flexibility and organizational health are reflected in our “modern approach to work” enabling employees to choose office locations or work from home to retain talent, although such changes may “negatively impact employee productivity.” The report describes strategic initiatives to enhance “operational flexibility,” including investments to increase data center capacity and establish cloud services in new geographic locations to meet customer demand, and recognizes the importance of “integrating acquired products and services and enhancing existing products and services” to preserve our competitive position. It also highlights the risk that a disruption of critical business operations concentrated in a few geographic areas, such as a major earthquake or political unrest, “could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations,” necessitating contingency planning and adaptive response strategies. This multifaceted approach underscores the firm’s capacity to absorb strain and adapt its organizational practices to preserve functioning and performance under adverse conditions.

Our risk disclosures emphasize the maintenance of business continuity and preservation of performance under challenging conditions by investing in and adapting our technical infrastructure and operational processes. We underscore “our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure” and warn that any “disruptions in our service,” including “system failures or outages” resulting from “earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events,” or from “supply and labor shortages and other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical infrastructure,” may damage our reputation, impair user engagement, and adversely affect our financial results. We note that the “covid-19 pandemic … exposed our business to a variety of other risks,” even as “we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement” of our user base during shelter-in-place measures, and that “we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty,” highlighting the need for operational flexibility, strategic adaptation, and resilience strategies. As we continue “operating our business in multiple countries around the world,” we describe proactive measures—modifying procurement practices to secure critical components, diversifying supplier relationships, expanding data center capacity, and enhancing emergency response protocols—to absorb strain, preserve integrity and performance, and transform in response to evolving regulatory requirements, market volatility, and environmental perturbations.

Disruptions to our manufacturing operations from natural disasters or other events; the effects of the public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken to limit COVID-19’s spread, including reductions in production levels, R&D activities, product development, technology transitions, yield enhancement activities, and qualification activities; efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through working from home, limiting the number of meeting attendees, reducing the number of people in certain of our sites at any one time, quarantines of team members, contractors, or vendors, limiting employee travel, physical-distancing measures, upgrades to our sites, COVID-19 testing and vaccination, enhanced cleaning measures, and increased use of personal protective equipment; increased costs, business disruptions, attrition, and reduced employee morale resulting from our mandate that all U.S. employees and contractors entering our U.S. buildings be fully vaccinated; increased costs for, or unavailability of, transportation, raw materials, components, electricity and other energy sources; reductions in, or cessation of, operations at any site due to government restrictions on movement and our measures to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID-19; disruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing and transportation of materials, components, equipment and services from areas impacted by COVID-19 or follow-on effects on the worldwide supply chain; constraints within our supply chain for certain IC components that may limit our bit shipments; shortages or increases in lead times for materials, components, or capacity that may limit bit shipments in the near term; potential underutilization of production assets resulting from a weak demand environment, industry oversupply, inventory surpluses, or difficulties in ramping emerging technologies; inventory strategies involving lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value assessments to address potential obsolescence and excess quantities; inability to sell in-process or finished goods inventories to alternative customers or to manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications; dependency on a limited number of suppliers for materials and services that meet our standards and the risk that suppliers may allocate capacity to other customers; reliance on advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment from single suppliers and the risk of delays in obtaining such equipment; geographic diversification of our manufacturing facilities in multiple countries to mitigate risks from political or public health crises, natural occurrences such as droughts, earthquakes, tsunamis, severe weather and geological events, and climate change; responses to breaches of our physical security systems or cyberattacks on our network systems; efforts to protect and retain key employees through workplace policies, vaccine mandates, and competitive compensation to maintain organizational health; management of government incentives conditioned upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations; contingency planning and potential restructuring charges in response to changes in business conditions or product roadmaps; compliance with customer responsible sourcing requirements and related regulations to ensure supply continuity; anticipation of downturns in the worldwide economy and deteriorations in credit markets; maintenance of sufficient liquidity through cash flows from operations, marketable investments, available financing, and share repurchase authorizations; ongoing assessment and accrual for legal, regulatory, tax, and litigation contingencies; and significant capital investments in R&D and next-generation manufacturing processes—each reflecting our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances.

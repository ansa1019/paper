The company’s risk factors section outlines its approach to sustaining operations under challenging conditions by identifying material economic, industry and cyclical downturns that could diminish demand, increase product cancellations and obsolete inventory, and exert pricing pressures, thereby requiring mitigation through market diversification and strategic resource reallocation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company mobilized products and services for virus diagnostics, scaled molecular testing and plastic consumables, expanded biosciences and bioproduction capacity to meet vaccine manufacturing needs, and implemented safety measures—such as quarantines and facility restrictions—while maintaining close communication with sites, employees, customers and suppliers to mitigate disruptions and preserve operational continuity. The need to develop new products and adapt to rapid technological change is addressed through investing in research and development, allocating funding to high-growth prospects, expanding service offerings, combining sales and marketing operations, strengthening geographic presence, and enhancing commercial infrastructure to support cross-selling, reflecting strategic agility, innovation and reconfiguration of resources. Supply chain resilience is emphasized via reliance on sole and multiple sources of critical materials, contingency planning for supplier failures, and preparation for natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical events, and transportation interruptions that could disrupt production or delivery. Information technology resilience is addressed through upgrading enterprise systems, safeguarding against cyber-attacks and data breaches, disaster recovery planning and maintaining controls to ensure continuous operation of critical processes and protection of sensitive data. Human capital resilience is underscored by efforts to attract, retain and train scientific, technical, clinical and management personnel and foster a strong workplace culture. Financial resilience is demonstrated by generating free cash flow, maintaining cash balances and revolving credit facilities, prudent management of indebtedness and covenant compliance, and deploying capital for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to support organizational objectives. Regulatory and quality resilience is maintained through continuous monitoring of evolving environmental, health and safety, food and drug regulations, robust quality management systems in pharma services and manufacturing under current good manufacturing practices, and proactive compliance programs, including intellectual property protection and adherence to ESG standards, all of which collectively support the maintenance of positive adjustment, adaptation and performance under adverse and uncertain conditions.

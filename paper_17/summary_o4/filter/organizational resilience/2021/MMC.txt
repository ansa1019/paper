The Company’s annual report acknowledges that its “inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.” It further warns that if it “experience[s] a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, protests or riots, security breach, cyberattack (including manipulating the control systems of critical infrastructure), power loss or telecommunications failure, our ability to operate will depend, in part, on the continued availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations,” noting that “in such an event, we could experience operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business.” In response to “global health concerns relating to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus,” the Company “modified our business practices (including continuing to operate in a largely remote model as the pandemic has persisted across the globe, introducing vaccine mandates for certain U.S. colleagues or visitors to be on premises where legally viable to do so, and re-calibrating return-to-office plans with evolving health and safety standards),” and states that “we will continue to evolve our business practices as we adopt hybrid working arrangements and evaluate further implementing employee vaccine requirements and other health and safety protocols,” and “expect to continue to service clients effectively in both the remote and in-office environments.” The report underscores that “our operations depend in particular upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage. If a business continuity event occurs, we could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to our operations or delivery of services to our clients,” and that “such risks have increased significantly due to extended remote work accommodations as a result of COVID-19.” It cautions that “a cyberattack or other business continuity event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations or our ability to recover data, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues,” and notes that “we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession.” The Company further acknowledges that “a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover from such an event, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships and legal liability,” and that “our business disruption insurance may also not fully cover, in type or amount, the cost of a successful recovery in the event of such a disruption.” Moreover, it recognizes that its “business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change,” and that “failure to maintain our corporate culture, particularly in a hybrid work environment, could damage our reputation.” This disclosure reflects the Company’s focus on maintaining operational continuity, adapting to disruptive events, deploying resources for technology and people, and preserving organizational functioning under adverse and unexpected conditions.

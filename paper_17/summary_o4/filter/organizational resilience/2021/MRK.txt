The company’s 2021 Form 10-K describes a range of risk management and operational practices designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions, noting that while it cannot predict the full extent of COVID-19 or future public health threats, it has implemented enterprise-wide adaptations to its manufacturing and supply chain networks, engaged in collaborations to expand vaccine and antiviral capacity, and pursued business continuity measures to maintain operational performance. It has identified physical and transitional climate-related risks—including extreme weather events, rising sea levels and low-carbon transition requirements—and is upgrading facilities, assessing legal and regulatory changes, and incorporating environmental, social and governance considerations to mitigate these exposures. To manage financial volatility, the company employs revenue hedging and balance-sheet risk management programs using foreign-currency forward contracts, purchased options and interest rate swaps, maintains high-credit-quality cash and investment portfolios, and has a $6 billion backup credit facility to ensure liquidity for research and development, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. The company commits substantial resources to research and development, protects its market exclusivity through a robust patent strategy and litigation readiness, refines provisions for sales discounts, returns and contingent liabilities based on historical experience and scenario analyses, and monitors inventory and customer mix to support forecast accuracy. Cybersecurity resilience is advanced through ongoing monitoring of information technology systems, modernization initiatives, and recovery planning following a 2017 global network attack. Organizational redesign under a global restructuring program, expected to be substantially completed by 2023, targets annual cost savings of approximately $900 million by optimizing manufacturing, supply networks and real-estate footprints. The company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, remeasures contingent consideration liabilities at each reporting period, and assesses long-lived asset recoverability in response to changing economic, regulatory and legal conditions. It updates pension and other postretirement benefit assumptions to reflect prevailing discount rates and market expectations, and recognizes tax benefits only when positions are more likely than not to be sustained, thereby maintaining system integrity, strategic flexibility and continuity of core business functions in the face of internal and external disturbances.

We maintain formal business-continuity and disaster-recovery programs designed to protect our ability to operate under unexpected circumstances—including a detailed business continuity plan to safeguard employee health, contingency plans for key personnel who may become unable to perform duties, mandatory vaccination and remote-work capabilities, and reliance on third-party hosting and technology infrastructures.  We depend heavily on our financial, accounting and other data-processing systems—and on those of key vendors such as third-party administrators, escrow agents and escrow agents—and acknowledge that if any of these systems fail, are disabled, or are not appropriately updated, or if a disaster or other disruption occurs, including cybersecurity attacks, our business continuity plans may be insufficient to mitigate resulting losses or interruptions.  While we seek to mitigate internal and external pressures—such as natural disasters, global pandemics, cyber threats, or other operational disruptions—through operational flexibility, contingency financing and information-security measures, we cannot provide assurance that our risk-assessment processes, emergency-management protocols or reserve-financing arrangements will fully preserve our functioning or performance under all challenging conditions.

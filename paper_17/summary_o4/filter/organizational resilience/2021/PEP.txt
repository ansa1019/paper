The report details a comprehensive approach to sustaining operations and preserving performance under challenging conditions by embedding resilience throughout the enterprise. It describes the development and implementation of health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on facilities, distribution networks, supply chains and workforce availability, including temporary closures, labor shortages and transportation constraints. To manage internal and external pressures—ranging from economic uncertainty and commodity inflation to climate-driven water scarcity, natural disasters, civil unrest and regulatory change—the company has instituted an integrated risk management framework with board and committee oversight, cross-functional risk committees, a centralized risk management office, enterprise audit and compliance functions, and dynamically updated contingency plans. Strategic end-to-end transformation initiatives, branded “PepsiCo Positive (pep+),” drive system-wide adaptation by reconfiguring sourcing, manufacturing and distribution processes; investing in digital and analytics capabilities to anticipate shifts in consumer demand; diversifying sourcing and deploying hedging instruments to manage commodity price risk; and strengthening inter-organizational collaboration with bottlers, suppliers and service providers. These actions, together with productivity initiatives, enterprise resource planning deployments and e-commerce and direct-to-consumer models such as SodaStream, are designed to enhance operational flexibility, preserve core functions amid disruptions, and maintain positive adjustment and performance even in extreme, volatile or exceptional circumstances.

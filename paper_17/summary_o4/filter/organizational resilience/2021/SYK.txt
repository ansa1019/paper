Throughout the report, the Company details its response to “severe disruptions in the market and the global and United States economies” caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, acknowledging that “a significant number of our customers, global suppliers, distributors and manufacturing facilities” were and could continue to be “materially affected by restrictive measures.” In this context, management describes “a significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted,” including reallocating resources to areas of higher demand, accelerating product development and production, and implementing workforce mitigation measures to address labor shortages and retain skilled personnel. The Company has invested in business continuity plans and the implementation of a new commercial global enterprise resource planning system to maintain operational flexibility, enhance disaster recovery, and absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. It has also bolstered cybersecurity defenses in light of “numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats” and a “greater number of employees working remotely,” thereby protecting IT systems, data security and supply chain integrity. Financial resilience measures include maintaining investment-grade credit ratings, managing currency exchange risks through hedging, securing revolving credit facilities, and executing a disciplined capital allocation strategy—prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—to ensure liquidity and facilitate rapid reconfiguration of financial resources. Recognizing the risks of global operations—from regulatory changes and trade disruptions to the “physical effects of climate change”—the Company continually adapts its regulatory compliance, supply chain sourcing from sole-source providers, and inflationary cost management to sustain performance under pressure. Finally, under its corporate responsibility and ESG framework, it establishes evolving environment and sustainability initiatives, anticipating stakeholder expectations and mitigating reputational risk to uphold organizational health and resilience in turbulent markets.

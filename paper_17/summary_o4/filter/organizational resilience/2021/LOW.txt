In our assessment of strategic, competitive, operational and reputational risks, we recognize that failure to adapt our business concept in a “rapidly evolving retail environment” to address changing shopping habits and demographics or to realize the intended benefits of strategic initiatives could adversely affect our operational flexibility, resource deployment and competitive advantage. Adapting our business concept to respond to customers’ evolving expectations regarding how they research, purchase and receive products and services, and offering more localized merchandise assortments to meet individual customer needs, is critical to maintaining continuity of operations and preserving performance under challenging conditions. The success of our strategic initiatives to evolve our omnichannel sales and marketing presence has required us to deliver large, complex programs through integrated planning, initiative prioritization and sequencing, and to develop new competencies in our workforce; to the extent management, employees or contractors are unable or unwilling to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of these initiatives. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times, costs and options depends on successful implementation and continued maintenance of our supply chain transformation initiatives, including our market-based delivery model, and our capacity to source alternative vendors and materials in response to geopolitical, tariff or pandemic-related disruptions that place unprecedented strains on the global supply chain. We also face the risk that the failure of key vendors, service providers or third-party installers cannot be quickly remedied, which would require operational adjustments and temporary resource reallocations. In addition, our information systems and those of third-party vendors are subject to damage or interruption from catastrophic events, power outages, technology system failures, cyber-attacks or other vulnerabilities; without proper maintenance, improvements and disaster recovery capabilities, our ability to provide a consistent and reliable omnichannel experience may be impaired, leading to data loss, erosion of customer confidence and financial losses. Furthermore, the unauthorized release of sensitive customer, employee or vendor information or non-compliance with evolving data privacy and cybersecurity regulations could materially increase our costs, expose us to legal or regulatory sanctions and undermine our organizational resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected our business operations, demand for our products and services, our labor force, inventory availability and supply chain operations, creating considerable uncertainty and necessitating continual adaptation to public health measures, macroeconomic shifts and consumer behavior changes. Finally, uncharacteristic weather conditions, natural disasters, climate change and potential regulatory changes related to environmental and social goals present both physical and transition risks that may interrupt operations, increase costs, and impact our long-term ability to maintain integrity and performance under adverse conditions.

The 10-K describes multiple measures and exposures that relate to the company’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adversity, including reliance on the orderly operation of merchandise receiving and distribution processes through depots and processing, packaging and manufacturing facilities whose disruptions from fires, tornadoes, pandemics or other catastrophic events may delay production and delivery and adversely affect member satisfaction; the criticality of information technology systems to process high transaction volumes and the need to build strong digital resiliency against power outages, security breaches, internal errors and extreme weather conditions, with substantial investments underway to maintain and enhance IT and backup systems; the requirement to maintain the privacy and security of sensitive business and personal information in the face of increasing cybersecurity threats and regulatory compliance demands; investments and acquisitions aimed at improving the speed, accuracy and efficiency of supply chains and delivery channels, acknowledging that these investments may be less predictable than new warehouse openings; management’s belief that cash flows from operations, cash and short-term investments, borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, letter of credit arrangements and self-insurance programs provide adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet foreseeable requirements and mitigate the impact of market and operational disruptions; the ongoing evaluation of risks arising from disruptions in warehouses, depots, manufacturing, IT systems, supply chains, workforce availability, regulatory changes and health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to produce unpredictable and volatile effects on operations, demand, inventory, costs, and access to labor; the use of self-insurance and reinsurance programs to fund employee health, workers’ compensation, general liability and property damage exposures; preopening and expansion expenses for new warehouses, international markets and distribution facilities; and the company’s historical success in adapting its pricing, merchandise mix, private-label penetration and online offerings as part of its strategy to provide consistent value to members and to leverage operating efficiencies, all of which together support the organization’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

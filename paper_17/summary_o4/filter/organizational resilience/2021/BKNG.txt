Our disclosures emphasize the maintenance of business continuity and operational flexibility under challenging conditions, including our ability to respond to and keep up with the rapid pace of technological and market changes and to successfully manage growth and expand our global business; we acknowledge that our reliance on third-party providers—such as accommodation and restaurant partners, payment processors, GDSs, meta-search platforms, call-center vendors, and cloud-hosting services—exposes us to risks that these partners may cease operations or suffer security breaches, which could interrupt service, impair our system integrity, and require significant remediation efforts. We note that our computer hardware is located in hosting facilities around the world, yet we do not maintain a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every region, leaving us vulnerable to human error, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, and other internal or external disturbances and highlighting our need to develop redundancy and risk mitigation measures. The ongoing shift of more transactions to a merchant model demonstrates our efforts at resource reconfiguration and strategic adaptation to offer flexible payment solutions and cancellation policies, while our performance marketing efficiency, which depends on search algorithms, bid strategies, and brand marketing, illustrates our continuous assessment of resource allocation and competitive positioning. We recognize that the competition for highly skilled employees and evolving workplace models may strain our organizational health and capacity to innovate, so we invest in attracting, developing, and retaining talent to sustain our organizational capabilities. We also face significant regulatory and tax pressures—including digital services taxes, data-privacy requirements, and pension-scheme litigation—that require ongoing risk assessment, legal contingency planning, and financial resilience. Our goodwill impairment charges and provisions for expected credit losses reflect collateral learning from revenue declines and cancellations, and our use of foreign-currency hedging and derivative instruments underscores our systemic perspective on preserving integrity and performance amid currency volatility. Through these strategic initiatives—ranging from the phased migration to upgraded financial and ERP systems, the “connected trip” integration, continuous enhancements to mobile platforms, and investments in cybersecurity and privacy compliance—we strive to absorb strain, mitigate hazards, and reconstitute trajectories of response and recovery so as to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

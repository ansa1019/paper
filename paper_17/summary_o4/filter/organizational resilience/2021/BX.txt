In addressing the risks of “significant setbacks in the reopening of the global economy” and reinstated lockdowns as a result of the ongoing pandemic, the company has invested in “operational continuity” and “business continuity” measures, adapting its technology infrastructure to enable secure remote working, enhancing disaster recovery and crisis management programs, and maintaining preparedness for “extreme” or “exceptional” disruptions in order to “absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity.” The firm’s approach emphasizes “risk assessment” and “resource allocation” across its real estate, private equity, hedge fund and credit businesses, diversifying liquidity with multiple capital sources, leveraging revolving credit facilities and performance allocations to maintain resilience in periods of market volatility and tightening in financial markets. It also confronts supply-chain and inflationary pressures through active portfolio management and cost reduction initiatives, reconfiguring organizational practices and strategic initiatives when faced with “external pressures” such as regulatory changes, geopolitical events or disruptions in trade. Cybersecurity enhancements and compliance with evolving data privacy regulations protect critical information and preserve “system integrity,” while a culture of “collaboration,” “inter-organizational networks” and “operational flexibility” reinforces the firm’s ability to anticipate, adapt and recover from disruptive events, ensuring the maintenance of “positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

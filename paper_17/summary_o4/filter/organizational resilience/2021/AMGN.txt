Amgen’s annual report acknowledges that “the COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations,” while noting that “if mitigation of the pandemic continues to require further shelter-in-place and shutdown orders … any adverse effects … will likely grow and could be enduring.” The company reports that “as the majority of our employees are working remotely, our reliance on our and third-party information technology systems has increased substantially and is expected to continue to increase” and that it “continues to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems,” yet acknowledges “there can be no assurances that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks and/or breaches.” Amgen also identifies risks such as “a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach” that could “interrupt the operation of our business,” “significant disruptions or production failures” at its Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks manufacturing facilities that “could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials,” reliance on “unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components” that could lead to supply constraints, and the potential for global climate change “and related natural disasters” to “negatively affect our business and operations.” To maintain business continuity and preserve system integrity under such internal and external variations, Amgen leverages financial resilience—including $8.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, committed credit facilities, investment-grade credit ratings and hedging programs—and strategic capital allocation across acquisitions, dividends and stock repurchases, while adapting to regulatory changes such as the phase-out of LIBOR, managing evolving environmental, social and governance objectives, and evolving its estimates for rebates, chargebacks, returns and the fair value of acquired intangible assets and contingent consideration, all in an effort to sustain performance, mitigate risk, and preserve organizational health and ongoing functioning under challenging conditions.

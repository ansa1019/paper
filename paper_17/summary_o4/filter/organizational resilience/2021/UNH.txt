The company discloses a multifaceted approach to preserving its operational integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances by continually forecasting and managing its cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet short-term and long-term obligations while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility; by periodically consolidating, integrating, upgrading and expanding its information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives, regulatory changes, evolving system platforms and new business acquisitions; by managing medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs and by intensifying medical and operating cost management, adjusting benefit designs and modifying care provider network size and composition on a county-by-county basis in response to funding pressures and pandemic-related disruptions; by leveraging data and analytics in collaboration with clinicians to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes; by employing scenario-based reserves estimation techniques using completion and trend factors grounded in historical experience and current health-care utilization indicators; by maintaining programs to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and providing employee awareness training on phishing, malware and other cyber risks; and by regularly assessing critical accounting estimates and goodwill for impairment—each of which reflects the organization’s systematic resource deployment, risk mitigation and adaptive reconfiguration of processes and systems to sustain continuity, reconstitute capabilities after disruptions and position itself for future growth.

Lockheed Martin’s annual report describes a rigorous process of identifying and monitoring technical, schedule and cost risks on long‐term contracts, assessing the effects of those risks on estimated total costs to complete and adjusting profit booking rates through “risk retirements” as conditions improve, or provisioning for full losses when costs are expected to exceed contract price.  In response to COVID-19, the company accelerated progress payments from the U.S. Government and used cash reserves to advance $2.2 billion of supplier payments, prioritizing small and at-risk businesses to sustain the supply chain and maintain operational continuity.  It maintains a $3 billion revolving credit facility, access to commercial paper markets and $3.6 billion in cash and equivalents to ensure liquidity under funding restrictions such as continuing resolutions, and balances its cash deployment among capital expenditures, R&D, debt management, pension risk transfers—through group annuity purchases of $4.9 billion of pension obligations—and dividends and share repurchases, reflecting a systemic approach to resource allocation and financial resilience.  The company’s backlog of $135 billion, including $88.5 billion of funded orders, provides forward visibility, and production rebaselining of the F-35 program restores stability and recovers shortfalls while preserving integrity of performance.  Environmental remediation liabilities are reviewed quarterly, with costs recoverable under government agreements recorded as assets, demonstrating adaptability and risk mitigation.  Pension plans are remeasured annually using market‐based discount rates and expected long‐term asset returns, and actuarial gains and losses are managed through corridor‐method amortization in accumulated other comprehensive loss, reflecting strategic foresight and system integrity in benefit funding.  Contract terms allow for recovery of actual costs plus reasonable profit margins, supporting continuity of operations, while the report’s sensitivity analyses—such as changes in discount rates, interest rates, foreign exchange hedges and equity investments—underscore continuous risk assessment, crisis response planning and maintenance of organizational performance under internal and external perturbations.

The annual report describes the company’s business continuity plans and other safeguards intended to mitigate disruptions to its supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and distribution network arising from natural disasters, pandemics—most notably the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic—and geopolitical or regulatory events, while acknowledging that these measures may not fully prevent adverse impacts such as facility closures, workforce unavailability or component shortages. It highlights the global semiconductor shortage’s effect on IQOS device supply, the development of contingency plans including domestic production alternatives and appeals of importation bans, and the evolution of its approach to supply chain monitoring, backups and risk assessments to maintain product availability and customer engagement. The report further details risks stemming from reliance on third-party resources, which improve efficiency but reduce direct control and require adaptive responses to regulatory initiatives driven by the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and FDA authorizations, prompting strategic advocacy for science-based frameworks. It illustrates how administrative and legal challenges, including customs assessments, litigation, intellectual property disputes and cybersecurity threats, compel the company to reconfigure operational strategies, reallocate resources, optimize organizational design, strengthen data governance and reinforce system integrity to preserve performance under pressure and support long-term resilience in a turbulent, highly regulated and competitive environment.

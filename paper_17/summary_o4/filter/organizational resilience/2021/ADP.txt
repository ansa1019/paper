ADP’s disclosures indicate a comprehensive resilience framework including disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect against natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures and similar disruptions, together with programs and processes to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents through ongoing investments in systems, processes and information security controls. The company has implemented binding corporate rules under the EU GDPR as both a data processor and controller and regularly reviews, upgrades and enhances its anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering policies and procedures to mitigate legal and compliance risks. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, ADP prioritized the safety of its associates and the needs of its clients by maintaining uninterrupted payroll and tax processing services, providing tools to navigate governmental relief and launching a return-to-workplace solution to streamline employees’ safe transition. Broad-based transformation initiatives designed to streamline the organization, strengthen talent and culture, and support revenue growth, margin improvement and productivity, coupled with strategic, cloud-based human capital management innovation and research and development investments, enable system adaptation, operational flexibility and sustained performance. ADP leverages its highly cash-generative, low-capital-intensity business model and disciplined resource deployment—including short-term financing arrangements and laddered investment portfolios for client funds—to absorb the impact of economic downturns, maintain liquidity, safeguard client assets and remain steadfast in its long-term strategy and shareholder-friendly actions.

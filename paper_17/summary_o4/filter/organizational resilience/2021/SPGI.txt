The Company emphasizes its comprehensive business continuity program as having effectively maintained operations since mid-March 2020, including the near-immediate transition of virtually its entire workforce to remote work, and underscores the importance of preserving client support, productivity and service delivery amid the COVID-19 pandemic and potential natural or man-made disasters.  It describes active monitoring and ongoing enhancement of disaster recovery, business continuity and management succession plans to safeguard its office facilities, personnel and critical computer, telecommunications and network systems against failures, disruptions, cyber intrusions and data breaches, noting that unauthorized disclosure or system malfunction could interrupt operations, damage reputation, incur regulatory or legal consequences and erode customer confidence.  The filing further details the company’s adaptive response to external pressures in the context of its pending merger, including agreeing to divestitures to secure regulatory approval, accepting contractual restrictions prior to closing, and allocating substantial resources and technology investments to integrate and harmonize the combined enterprises while striving to achieve cost and revenue synergies without materially disrupting customer, supplier and employee relations.  It highlights diversified risk mitigation measures—such as revising index compositions or rating methodologies, modifying pricing structures, intensifying vendor oversight when outsourcing critical functions, and publishing timely economic analyses—to support operational flexibility, preserve financial resilience under market volatility and maintain performance in adverse conditions.  Finally, the Company acknowledges that continued vigilance in evolving legal, regulatory, data-privacy and intellectual-property environments, together with disciplined capital allocation, scalable infrastructure investments and proactive stakeholder engagement, underpins its capacity to absorb strain and sustain organizational integrity and functionality during periods of uncertainty and change.

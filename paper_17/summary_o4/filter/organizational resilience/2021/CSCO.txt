During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has maintained positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continuously monitoring the evolving situation, taking actions in accordance with relevant authorities’ recommendations, and implementing work-from-home and other protective measures to support operational continuity, while realigning the organization through a voluntary early retirement program to free resources for key strategic priorities.  To mitigate unprecedented supply chain and manufacturing constraints, it has partnered with key suppliers to extend coverage, revised supplier arrangements, entered into multi-year procurement commitments and agreements with contract manufacturers, and increased inventory and purchase commitments—balancing the need for competitive lead times with the risk of obsolescence.  The company plans operating expenses based on forecasted revenue levels, manages inventory and deferred revenue, and conducts regular risk assessments of contingent liabilities, all while preserving liquidity through cash, high-quality investments and credit facilities to satisfy working capital, capital expenditures, customer financing and contractual obligations.  It continues to invest in research and development, sales, marketing and infrastructure platforms to address shifting customer needs for digital transformation, accelerate software and subscription offerings, and support service innovation and customer outcomes.  Free cash flow is prioritized for reinvestment in the business, strategic acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases under its capital allocation program.  Throughout, the company has adapted its product and service portfolio, provided no-cost trials of key technologies, and moved toward a hybrid work model, demonstrating organizational flexibility, resourcefulness and resilience to preserve performance and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

In our risk factors, we acknowledge that rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, new product introductions and industry standards require us to timely identify emerging changes and develop or enhance products, services and technologies; expand our ecosystem; accurately forecast demand; meet evolving safety and compliance standards; manage product, software and service lifecycles to sustain customer satisfaction; and develop infrastructure to scale our business, demonstrating operational flexibility and resource allocation to maintain performance under pressure. We make substantial investments in research and development and business offerings, recognizing that failure to develop new offerings or to adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve could materially harm our business. In response to global supply shortages, we revised our supply-chain processes, placing non-cancellable inventory orders up to twelve months in advance, paying premiums and deposits to secure future supply and capacity, and building finished products to shorten shipment lead times, actions that balance resource deployment against the risk of excess inventory if demand shifts. We depend on third parties for wafer fabrication and subcontracted assembly, testing and packaging, which reduces our control over quantity, quality and delivery schedules and requires risk mitigation against supply-chain disruptions from natural disasters, geopolitical events or pandemics. Following a cybersecurity incident in February 2022, we engaged in remedial and preventative actions—rotating credentials, hardening our network, analyzing exfiltrated information and notifying law enforcement—illustrating our crisis response and recovery mechanisms. Our worldwide operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters, extreme weather, infrastructure failures, acts of war, terrorism, civil unrest, epidemics and other catastrophic events, and we have modified business and workforce practices—including remote work and travel restrictions—during the COVID-19 pandemic while preparing for incremental in-office costs and evaluating supply-chain and logistical contingencies. We rely on internal processes and information systems, and plan to implement a new enterprise resource planning system, aware that any system failures or control deficiencies could disrupt operations or impair financial reporting. We also recognize that attracting, retaining and motivating key executives and employees, and managing succession and labor regulations, are essential capabilities for sustaining our organizational health, performance and resilience in turbulent markets.

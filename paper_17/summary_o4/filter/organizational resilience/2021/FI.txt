We maintain and test comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans designed to preserve critical operations, assets and data through internal and external disturbances such as system failures, cyberattacks, natural disasters, pandemics, supply-chain interruptions and third-party performance issues.  Our operations depend on redundant processing, network and hosting sites, rigorous information security controls and incident-response protocols to detect, investigate and remediate unauthorized access or system disruptions and to safeguard sensitive data.  We continuously invest significant resources in cybersecurity, control enhancements and safety measures—such as facility disinfection, employee testing, personal protective equipment and vaccination requirements—to protect employees, clients and vendors and to limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on productivity and service levels.  We recognize that operational failures and interruptions may delay or prevent the timely recovery of critical functions through our business continuity program and could lead to client contractual penalties or legal disputes.  As a provider of payments and financial technology solutions, we are required by clients, regulators and network rules to maintain disaster recovery plans, conduct frequent testing, and meet specified service-level and continuity requirements, which may require material investments of time and capital.  We also collaborate with other participants in the global financial system to minimize cascading disruptions, and we continually adapt our operational and security practices to evolving technological risks, regulatory developments and market conditions.  These multi-faceted resilience strategies reflect our ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, and adapt to internal or external variations in order to sustain performance and fulfill our obligations.

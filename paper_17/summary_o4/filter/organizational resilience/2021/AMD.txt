AMD’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to preserving organizational resilience under challenging conditions by identifying and mitigating a wide range of internal and external pressures—from the cyclical semiconductor market and competitive dynamics to geopolitical, regulatory and environmental disruptions—and by adapting its operational, supply-chain and strategic processes to absorb strain and maintain performance. The company acknowledges that “global economic and market uncertainty” and the “ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic” could materially disrupt its operations and workforce, and it has responded by monitoring public-health measures, enabling remote work, assessing and adjusting product schedules and roadmaps, and implementing long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements to secure stable supplies of equipment, materials and substrates. AMD relies on a diversified network of third-party wafer foundries, assembly, test and logistics providers—while retaining full flexibility to contract with alternative foundries—to allocate manufacturing capacity among customers, mitigate supply constraints, reconfigure sourcing strategies and manage inventory through rapid product transitions and short lifecycles. Under its amended wafer supply agreement with GlobalFoundries, AMD has agreed minimum annual capacity allocations and pre-payment obligations through 2025, and its joint ventures provide additional back-end manufacturing services. The company continuously evaluates risks to its internal business processes and information systems, including cybersecurity threats, to preserve system integrity and support critical functions. It also manages demand forecasting for OEM and distributor channels to minimize mismatches between supply and demand, controls gray-market activity to protect margins, maintains compatibility with industry standards, and complies with export control, environmental, tax and conflict-minerals regulations. Through these strategic initiatives—encompassing resource allocation, operational flexibility, risk assessment and contingency planning—AMD seeks to absorb internal and external variations, safeguard business continuity and emerge stronger from disruptions.

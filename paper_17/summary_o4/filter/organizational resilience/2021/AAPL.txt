In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company implemented unprecedented measures—restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of retail stores and channel partner points of sale, a requirement that substantially all employees work remotely and a phased reopening of facilities under health and safety operating restrictions—while continuously monitoring the situation and taking actions in accordance with authorities’ recommendations. Such actions, together with investments in system redundancy, business continuity and disaster recovery planning, insurance coverage for certain losses and the establishment of manufacturing purchase obligations and prepayments under long-term supply agreements with outsourcing partners, are intended to secure the supply of critical components, mitigate risks arising from natural disasters, pandemics, industrial accidents, cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions, and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances. The company’s reliance on single or limited sources for many components and its large, complex global supply chain expose it to significant supply and pricing risks, which it addresses by changing suppliers, restructuring relationships and pre-positioning process equipment, although it acknowledges these measures may be insufficient under extreme conditions. To maintain financial resilience under macroeconomic and industry pressures, the company maintains ample liquidity—cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities—supplements this with access to debt markets and hedges foreign currency exposures through forward and option contracts, and manages its capital return program while recognizing that fluctuations in demand, component shortages, trade restrictions and evolving public health measures can materially affect its operational flexibility, require substantial recovery time and expenditures, and influence its ability to sustain performance under pressure.

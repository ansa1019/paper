Bank of America’s 2021 Annual Report describes a multi-faceted resilience framework designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, encompassing board-approved risk appetite limits overseen by enterprise and management committees and underpinned by a clear three-lines-of-defense governance structure. The corporation executes and periodically tests comprehensive business continuity plans—including remote-operations protocols, third-party service resilience, pandemic response measures, supply-chain disruption mitigation and cyber-incident recovery—to ensure operational flexibility and continuity of critical services. Through contingency funding and recovery plans, diversified liquidity sources such as global liquidity buffers, secured and unsecured funding, deposit inflows and central bank facilities, and robust liquidity stress testing under both baseline and severe macroeconomic upside/downside scenarios, the firm aligns strategic planning, capital management and liquidity risk management to absorb strain and preserve performance under internal or external variations. Credit resilience is supported by forward-looking allowance models that integrate multiple macroeconomic scenarios, concentration limits, syndicated loan structures, credit derivatives and collateral management, while trading-book resilience is enhanced by var- and scenario-based stress testing, dynamic hedging of interest-rate, foreign-exchange and mortgage rate exposures, and ongoing valuation controls. A multi-layered cybersecurity program and operational risk management policies reinforce system integrity and rapid crisis response, and enterprise policies govern environmental and social risk to anticipate and adapt to climate-related financial and physical risks. Collectively, these practices illustrate Bank of America’s capacity to assess, mitigate and adapt to disruptive events, safeguard its financial condition and sustain its core operations and services through adverse and exceptional conditions.

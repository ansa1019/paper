During the COVID-19 pandemic, Boeing acknowledged facing increased operational challenges—from production site shutdowns, workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people, social-distancing guidelines and heightened employee absenteeism to reduced availability of raw materials and goods across its own facilities and those of its customers and suppliers—and continues to monitor federal, state and municipal health authorities for new or modified guidance that may necessitate additional operational restrictions or suspensions at key production sites; while operations have since resumed at all production sites, the company cannot predict where further disruptions may occur or the ongoing impact of pandemic-related operating restrictions, noting near-term production inefficiencies and additional operating costs, and warning that further increases in absenteeism or attrition could cause operational disruptions that would adversely affect production costs, delivery schedules and its ability to meet customer commitments. The company likewise continues to monitor the health and stability of its supply chain as it ramps up production, reprioritizing production resources to support inspections and rework on undelivered aircraft, engaging in detailed discussions with regulators regarding required actions for resuming deliveries, and implementing changes in production processes to ensure newly built airplanes meet specifications and avoid further rework. Boeing has focused on minimizing disruption caused by production changes, achieving operational stability and implementing productivity improvements to meet evolving market demand and sustain profitability, seeking opportunities to reduce supplier costs, optimize inventory management, reconfigure resource allocation and capture efficiency gains. To safeguard its financial capacity to respond to unexpected conditions and external pressures, Boeing manages substantial liquidity through cash, short-term investments and backup credit facilities, expects to fund its ongoing requirements through internal resources and access to capital markets, and actively evaluates its debt structure to preserve financial flexibility. Finally, recognizing cybersecurity threats to confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and systems, the company maintains an extensive network of technical security controls, policy-enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity and thereby support operational continuity under challenging conditions.

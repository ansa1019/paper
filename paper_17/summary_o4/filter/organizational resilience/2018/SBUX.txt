Starbucks notes that it operates in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing environment, with new factors emerging unpredictably; it continues to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss; our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans are intended to resolve operational interruptions effectively; while operational safeguards are in place, they may not fully prevent system failures; the company relies heavily on information technology in its operations and growth initiatives, including interconnected administrative functions, point-of-sale processing, supply chain management and digital capabilities, reflecting an emphasis on system integrity and capacity; in response to evolving market conditions and strategic alliances, Starbucks realigned its organizational and operating segment structures in support of the global coffee alliance, restating prior period financial information and reclassifying costs to align operating expenses with revenue-generating activities; it uses a combination of pricing features embedded in supply contracts and financial derivatives to manage commodity price risk and manages exposure to market-based risks under a formal market price risk management policy; Starbucks regularly reviews cash positions, capital allocations and reinvestment assertions for foreign earnings, and evaluates property, plant and equipment and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment to ensure resource reconfiguration and preservation of performance under changing conditions; the company anticipates moderate revenue growth in fiscal 2019 driven by comparable store sales and approximately 2,100 net new stores globally, supported by long-term investments, strategic initiatives for U.S. and China expansion, global brand licensing, business simplification and continual enhancement of the in-store and digital customer experience; future cash flows, combined with borrowing capacity, are expected to fund capital requirements and shareholder returns; we believe these measures support the maintenance of integrity and performance in the face of internal and external variations and disturbances, enable positive adjustment under challenging conditions and foster organizational flexibility, adaptability and resilience.

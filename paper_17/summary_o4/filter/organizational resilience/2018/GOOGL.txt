Management cautions that our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results, including the requirement to invest significant resources in research and development, data center operations and information technology infrastructure to maintain business continuity and prevent service interruptions; our ability to keep our products and services operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions is challenged by rapidly evolving technologies, shifting user needs across diverse devices and modalities, environmental perturbations from natural disasters and climate-change events, and supply chain disruptions due to supplier capacity constraints or financial difficulties; we devote significant resources to “state-of-the-art security protections” and incident response capabilities to counter “cyber attacks of varying degrees” and security breaches, while also managing evolving obligations under global privacy and data protection laws such as the GDPR and CCPA, which may require changes to business practices and incur additional costs; regulatory scrutiny and litigation risks in competition, intellectual property, content liability and tax matters may divert management focus, necessitate reconfiguring business practices and increase operational constraints; we mitigate financial variability from fluctuating foreign exchange rates through hedging programs and maintain substantial cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to support operational flexibility and the absorption of strain under adverse economic conditions; seasonal and macroeconomic volatility combined with intense competition compels continuous service innovation, strategic adaptation, inter-organizational collaboration and future-oriented planning to preserve core functioning, maintain integrity under internal or external pressures, and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

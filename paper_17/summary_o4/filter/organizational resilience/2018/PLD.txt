Prologis discloses that despite system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan, its internal and hosted information technology systems remain vulnerable to energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, any of which could cause material disruptions and incur additional costs, and it mitigates these risks through geographic diversification of its portfolio, borrowing in the currencies of its significant investments to provide natural hedges, use of derivative instruments to stabilize cash flows, and annual evaluation of insurance coverage for hurricane, flood, earthquake and terrorism perils—electing self-insurance where commercially reasonable—in order to preserve operational continuity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. The company further manages regulatory and compliance pressures across multiple jurisdictions, maintains operational flexibility and liquidity by upsizing credit facilities, borrowing short-term to meet REIT distribution requirements and, if necessary, divesting properties or adjusting lease terms to satisfy cash flow needs, and sustains business continuity through inter-organizational collaboration in co-investment ventures that enable resource reallocation and portfolio reconfiguration. Prologis also conducts impairment and recoverability analyses of its long-lived assets—using discounted cash flow models, capitalization rates and market-based assumptions—to assess asset integrity and firm performance in the face of environmental perturbations, market volatility and disruptive change, thereby supporting its ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The annual report emphasizes the company’s maintenance of operational continuity under challenging conditions by investing in comprehensive business continuity and disaster recovery plans—“should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations”—and by regularly assessing and improving these plans and key management succession to preserve system integrity, performance and human capital.  It acknowledges that “our inability to successfully recover … could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability,” especially given reliance on network systems, third-party vendors and outsourced functions whose failures or security breaches “may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information” or may “produce unreliable results” or “be insufficient, circumvented, or become obsolete.”  The report further details the dynamic reconfiguration of resources through strategic acquisitions and technology investments—while recognizing that such transactions “may require more resources than anticipated,” integration challenges and evolving privacy, cyber-security and regulatory regimes (e.g., GDPR, benchmark and MiFID II regulations, Brexit-related legal uncertainty) demand continuous adaptation of controls, risk assessment mechanisms and compliance frameworks.  Finally, it notes inherent uncertainty in litigation, tax audits and governmental inquiries, underscoring that despite “continuous review of the latest information available” and substantial investments in secure processing, storage and transmission of sensitive data, the firm cannot guarantee absolute security or fully predict outcomes, thereby positioning resilience as a multifaceted capability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve functioning under both nominal and extreme variations and disturbances.

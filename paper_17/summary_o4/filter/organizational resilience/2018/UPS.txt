UPS’s disclosures reflect a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by absorbing strain and preserving functioning when faced with internal and external pressures. The Company has undertaken a multi‐year “transformation strategy” to enhance operational flexibility and network resilience—“we continually adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels” and deploy technology‐enabled automation to improve sorting and delivery productivity, while acknowledging that “benefits of our efficiency and growth initiatives … will not be fully realized until future periods.” To mitigate financial volatility, UPS “indexes fuel surcharges and may also enter into hedging transactions to mitigate the impact of changes” in fuel costs, and “monitors and manages” currency and interest rate exposures through derivatives. The firm maintains self‐insurance reserves and casualty risk accruals to absorb unexpected claims and invests in “technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans” to ensure business continuity in the face of cyber‐attacks, severe weather, natural or manmade disasters. UPS also adapts its cost structure in response to adverse economic cycles—“we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions”—and leverages external partnerships, contract carriers and strategic capital expenditures to reconfigure capacity and maintain service continuity under capacity constraints, regulatory changes, labor uncertainties and evolving security requirements, thereby reflecting the organization’s capacity for risk mitigation, adaptation and performance maintenance in turbulent environments.

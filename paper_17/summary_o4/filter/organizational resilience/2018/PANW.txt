The annual report acknowledges that the company’s rapid growth “places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources” and cautions that “if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected.”  It explains that “to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner,” noting that “failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, disrupt our existing end-customer relationships, reduce demand … or harm our business performance and operating results.”  The report further emphasizes the need for adaptability amid external pressures, warning that “uncertain or weakened global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results” and that end-customer shifts “may result in lengthened sales cycles, any of which could harm our business and operating results.”  Supply chain resilience is highlighted by the disclosure that “our reliance on these manufacturing partners reduces our control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, product costs, product supply, timing and transportation risk,” and that “any disruption in our channel or termination of our relationships with important channel partners … could disrupt our supply chain.”  The company also underscores its cyber and disaster recovery readiness, acknowledging that a “breach in our data security or an attack against our service availability” could cause reputational harm, regulatory investigations, and “increased costs to remedy any problems and otherwise respond to any incident,” and it recognizes that locating its headquarters and primary manufacturing in the San Francisco Bay Area exposes it to seismic and other catastrophic events that could delay orders or shipments if “the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate.”  Finally, the report stresses the importance of organizational learning and integration, stating that “if we are unable to hire, integrate, train, or retain the qualified and highly skilled personnel required to fulfill our current or future needs, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed,” and that “our ability to execute, complete or integrate efficiently any acquisitions that we may undertake” is critical to realizing the benefits of strategic growth initiatives.

The Company describes its ongoing efforts to maintain business continuity and preserve operational integrity in the face of internal and external pressures, including reliance on suppliers, vendors and outsourcing partners to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize its products and the requirement that those parties deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis, while noting that natural or man-made disasters or acts of sabotage could disrupt its compound library and product development cycle. It acknowledges that disruptions in supply chain continuity—whether due to product seizures or recalls, forced plant closures, sole-source supplier failures or external factors such as natural disasters, war or terrorism—could adversely impact product supply and necessitate reconfiguration of resources or reliance on alternative third-party providers. Its information technology systems also face risks of breakdown, invasion or cyber-attack, which the Company seeks to mitigate through ongoing investments in protective monitoring practices and cyber insurance, while recognizing that no assurance exists that these efforts will prevent interruptions or data leakage. In response to evolving market, regulatory and competitive landscapes, the Company has transformed its operating model by streamlining administrative functions, focusing commercialization, R&D and manufacturing resources on prioritized brands and markets, and realigning its manufacturing network to enhance operational flexibility, support biologics capacity and enable the redeployment of cost savings into higher-priority opportunities. The Company continually evaluates its capital structure and liquidity position—holding cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities sufficient to satisfy dividends, capital expenditures, pension funding, a one-time transition tax and debt maturities—to ensure financial resilience and flexibility for strategic initiatives, including its pending acquisition of Celgene. It also monitors global economic and political risks, such as currency fluctuations, potential eurozone exits and benchmark interest-rate reforms, and adjusts pension plan funding strategies and hedging arrangements to mitigate the impact of external disturbances on its financial condition. Finally, the Company recognizes that successful integration of acquisitions, proactive risk assessment, adaptive resource allocation and robust crisis management mechanisms are essential to sustaining operational continuity under pressure and preserving long-term organizational resilience.

Applied discloses that as a supplier to cyclical and volatile industries, it is “subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors,” and that “to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations.”  It further explains that “during periods of increasing demand” it “must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs,” whereas “during periods of decreasing demand” it “must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees,” acknowledging that “even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.”  The company emphasizes that “uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets…pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates,” and that such conditions “make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses,” warning that failure to “appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions” could have a “significant negative impact” on its performance.  Applied also notes that it “may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities,” yet “even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers.”  To sustain operational resilience, the company states it must maintain “appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls,” adapt its “design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management,” and maintain “operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements” while “effectively allocating resources between existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets” and “improving the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities.”  Furthermore, it warns that “manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory,” and that “if Applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components, it could affect its ability to manage its operations, and have an adverse impact on Applied’s business, results of operations and customer relationships.”  The company also recognizes that “the loss or retirement of employees present particular challenges…resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.”

Amgen’s 2018 report describes a company-wide transformation and process improvement program launched in 2014 to create a more agile and efficient operating model, reallocate resources toward its innovative pipeline and product launches and execute a global restructuring plan; a resilient capital structure balancing cash dividends, $17.9 billion of share repurchases, term-limited debt and liquidity through commercial paper and a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, supplemented by interest-rate and cross-currency swap hedges to manage rate and currency exposure; an integrated global supply network centered in Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks that maintained production through Hurricane Maria via backup diesel generators and staggered grid reconnections, while investing in next-generation biomanufacturing plants in Rhode Island and Singapore to reduce facility footprints, water and energy use and strengthen operational continuity; risk-mitigation strategies including diversified third-party sourcing for proprietary raw materials and devices; adaptive reimbursement and regulatory engagement such as participation in the CMS oncology care model, policy advocacy on drug-pricing initiatives and introduction of new NDCs for Repatha® to address payer dynamics; robust cybersecurity and data-governance controls protecting IT infrastructure and distribution logistics; disciplined acquisition and alliance integration processes with contingent consideration frameworks and integration milestones; global expansion supported by localized regulatory, tax and compliance approaches in emerging markets to navigate economic and geopolitical volatility; comprehensive contingency planning for manufacturing, clinical development, legal proceedings and fiscal-plan oversight in Puerto Rico and for repatriation taxes under the 2017 Tax Act; and continuous monitoring of demand, inventory and sales-deduction accruals to sustain cash flow and operations, all reflecting Amgen’s ability to absorb strains, adapt to internal and external disturbances and preserve performance under challenging conditions.

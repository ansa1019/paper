The Company’s disclosures underscore its emphasis on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by proactively identifying and addressing a wide array of internal and external pressures that could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.  It acknowledges the necessity to devote continued efforts and financial resources to the development or acquisition of scientifically advanced technologies and products, to apply those technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, to obtain patent and regulatory approvals and to successfully manufacture and market products consistent with quality standards.  The Company monitors the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and its markets and assesses opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency while preserving its ability to invest in research and development, capital and its people, and it has undertaken global restructuring and optimization initiatives—approved by its board—to enhance growth potential, improve operating performance and meet anticipated market demands by optimizing its supply chain network capacity, building functional capabilities to support business growth and realigning expenses, with an expectation that a substantial portion of the resulting cost savings will be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.  To bolster its resilience to market volatility and geopolitical and financial uncertainty—including competitive activity, consolidation in healthcare, cost containment pressures, reimbursement reforms, currency fluctuations, sovereign debt issues and the impacts of Brexit—the Company maintains significant liquidity in cash and cash equivalents, a commercial paper program and revolving credit and bridge facilities, manages its debt levels to sustain investment-grade credit ratings, and establishes contingency reserves for legal, tax and compliance matters.  It also routinely evaluates and records provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, adjusts revenue recognition estimates for product returns and service obligations, remeasures contingent consideration liabilities, tests goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, and accrues for legal and product liability exposures, all of which reflect an organizational focus on risk assessment, resource reconfiguration and system integrity to preserve or improve functioning despite adverse conditions.

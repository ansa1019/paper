The Company’s disclosures underscore its dependence on a network of third‐party wafer foundries, assembly, test, mark and pack providers and logistics partners to ensure adequate capacity, quality and timely delivery in response to customer demand, while acknowledging that disruptions—ranging from manufacturing yield shortfalls, process technology delays (for example at 7 nm nodes), equipment or material shortages, supplier insolvency or reprioritization, natural disasters, geopolitical events or regulatory non-compliance—could give rise to supply constraints, excess inventory, delayed product introductions, heightened unit costs and materially adverse impacts on margins, revenue and customer relationships. To mitigate these risks and preserve operational continuity, management emphasizes the importance of reliable supplier relationships governed by wafer supply agreements and capacity allocation commitments, flexible product allocation strategies, ongoing investments in research and development and security controls, and proactive financing arrangements, recognizing that sustained competitiveness and performance maintenance depend on adapting product roadmaps to evolving industry standards, forecasting demand accurately, protecting intellectual property, enhancing information security, complying with environmental and trade regulations, and maintaining sufficient liquidity. This integrated approach to resource allocation, risk assessment, technology transitions and system integrity reflects the Company’s efforts to absorb strain, reconfigure operations under internal and external variations, and maintain or improve functioning despite adversity.

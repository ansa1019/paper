The annual report describes an organizational framework and set of practices designed to preserve system integrity and maintain operations under both routine and stressed conditions.  It notes that failures in or breaches of operational or security systems, whether internal or at third-party providers, can disrupt transaction processing or service delivery and adversely affect results, liquidity and reputation, and it highlights that backup systems may not always process data at full capacity or in a timely manner.  To mitigate such risks, the firm continuously updates its systems to support operations, growth and regulatory compliance, even as these updates entail integration costs and potential business interruptions.  The report also details contingency funding and capital plans—including intercompany arrangements under a “single point of entry” resolution strategy—to ensure the parent company and key subsidiaries retain access to liquidity, that assets may be sold or transactions structured to raise funding, and that capital buffers can be deployed if projected liquidity resources deteriorate.  Enterprise-wide stress forecasting and scenario-based stress testing of balance sheet, earnings and capital under adverse economic and business conditions are performed regularly, providing senior management and the board with insight into potential impacts of extreme events and informing risk appetite limits and recovery actions.  The corporation’s risk framework—embodied in a four-step process to identify, measure, monitor and control exposures—drives oversight of strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks, with clear escalation procedures and governance by the enterprise model risk committee to ensure quantitative models are validated and effectively challenged.  These measures collectively support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, preservation of performance through internal monitoring of systems and processes, and restoration of operations following disruptions.

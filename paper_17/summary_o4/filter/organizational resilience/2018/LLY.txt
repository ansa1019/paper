The Company recognizes that its business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by internal or external variationsâ€”including the high uncertainty and cost inherent in pharmaceutical research and development with a high rate of failure; loss of intellectual property exclusivity and rapid declines in revenues as patents expire; increasingly stringent regulatory thresholds and approval delays; vulnerabilities in complex information technology systems such as operating failures, service interruptions, security breaches, or cyber-attacks; reliance on third-party relationships for product development, manufacturing, commercialization, IT support, and distribution; manufacturing disruptions arising from natural disasters, system inadequacies, or raw material shortages; economic downturns, trade disputes, and currency exchange fluctuations; and unexpected safety or efficacy concerns leading to recalls or label changes. To mitigate these risks and maintain business continuity, the Company has implemented a range of resilience strategies, including continuous monitoring of the economic, regulatory, and credit environments; ongoing cost-structure reductions through asset impairments, restructuring charges, and suspension of non-core commercial activities; the use of derivative financial instruments and hedging to limit interest rate and foreign currency exposures; maintaining committed credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and cash balances to fund operating needs; establishing accruals for sales returns, rebates, discounts, and product liabilities; pursuing strategic acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing to bolster its development pipeline; and employing disciplined capital allocation through divestitures, share repurchases, and dividends, all of which serve to adapt resource deployment, preserve operational flexibility, and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

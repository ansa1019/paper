The 10-K underscores the necessity of maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by warning that “difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways,” noting that “turmoil in the global financial markets … can provoke significant volatility” with rapid impacts on valuations and liquidity, and highlighting the need for operational flexibility to “scale back … costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in revenue.” It describes strategies for resource reallocation, such as cutting services or personnel when faced with a difficult economic environment, and emphasizes the importance of business continuity and disaster recovery planning, cautioning that “operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, may disrupt our businesses” and that “our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient” to mitigate harm from system failures, cyberattacks, natural disasters or infrastructure disruptions. The filing details risk-management mechanisms, including the use of forward contracts, options and swaps “to limit our exposure to changes in … market developments,” and stresses the need for timely “analysis of policy changes” to anticipate regulatory, political and market shifts. It also highlights the value of internal knowledge and social capital by acknowledging that “the loss of the services” of key senior managing directors “could have a material adverse effect on our revenues” and commits to continuously “develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain this culture,” reflecting a systemic perspective on organizational health and resilience in an uncertain business environment.

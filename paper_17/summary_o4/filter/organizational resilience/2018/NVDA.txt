Throughout our risk disclosures, we recognize that “business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs” and that events such as earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, cloud outages, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, epidemics or other natural or man-made disasters could “require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations,” reflecting our focus on business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities. We “devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings” and “must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business in these areas, including customer service and customer support,” thereby enhancing our operational flexibility and capacity to adapt to evolving market requirements. To mitigate security risks, we “must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features” to counter system security and data protection breaches. Recognizing our reliance on third-party foundries and subcontractors, we implement supply-chain risk management to address potential “delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses” that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand. Our inventory management, including “provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value,” addresses variability in demand and technological change to prevent excess or obsolete inventory. We emphasize strategic planning to “anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends” and to adapt our product and investment strategies in a timely manner, thereby maintaining performance under challenging conditions and supporting ongoing resource allocation, risk assessment, and organizational adaptation.

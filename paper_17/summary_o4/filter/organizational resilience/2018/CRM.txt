In response to potential operational and environmental pressures including cyber-attacks, infrastructure failures, third-party service interruptions, natural disasters, terrorism and evolving security threats, the Company maintains and continually enhances business continuity and disaster recovery arrangements—governance policies, internal security controls, crisis management and disaster response plans—as well as near real-time replication of production environments and customer data to independent facilities and alternate infrastructures, while our board, audit committee and executive management receive regular updates on cybersecurity events, escalated risk responses and resilience strategies; we invest in additional database and hardware capacity globally and refine processes to mitigate resource constraints and service degradations, yet recognize that frequent changes in attack techniques, reliance on third-party data centers, local administrative actions, legal permitting requirements or climate-related extreme weather could impair service delivery, disrupt operations, increase attrition, impose financial liabilities and necessitate reallocation of resources; accordingly, we integrate operational flexibility, risk mitigation mechanisms and resilience engineering principles into our infrastructure and support systems to maintain performance under disturbance and recover from adverse events.

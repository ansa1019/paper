The Company cautions that “additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations,” and management “has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry and our company,” while expressing confidence that it “is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks.”  Our stated objective “to use our formidable assets—our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates—to achieve long-term sustainable growth” is underpinned by “five strategic priorities” and ongoing enhancement of “our core capabilities” to execute effectively under competitive pressure.  We have established “rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards” and an “integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations … against the same stringent standards,” thereby driving innovation that “provides new beverage options to meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences” and mitigating risk through constant governance and compliance.  In addressing natural-resource constraints, “our company regularly assesses the specific water-related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and has implemented a formal water risk management program,” with “water use efficiency and wastewater treatment in manufacturing operations; shared watershed protection efforts; engaging local communities; and addressing water resource management in our agricultural ingredient supply chain.”  To offset commodity and currency volatility, we “enter into hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases,” and our foreign operations “seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in foreign currencies,” including remeasurement in hyperinflationary economies.  We believe “our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths,” and we manage liquidity and cost of capital by “reviewing our optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly” and maintaining “significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments,” including through a global commercial paper program and committed lines of credit.  Impairment and recoverability assessments of noncurrent assets, goodwill, equity investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets are performed using discounted cash flow models and market-based valuations consistent with “the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use,” ensuring we can “absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity” and maintain resilient performance under internal or external disturbances.

The Company manages medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and care management programs while continually forecasting and managing its cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet both short- and long-term obligations and maintain liquidity and financial flexibility under regulatory, economic and market pressures. Its revolving bank credit facilities support its commercial paper borrowing program for general corporate purposes, providing contingency funding and contributing to operational continuity. Premium revenues are recognized as eligible individuals receive services and are adjusted by estimates of Risk Adjustment payments and minimum MLR rebates, with ongoing development of medical costs payable estimates reflecting favorable or unfavorable reserve adjustments from prior periods. To address funding pressures in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and other programs, the Company adapts product offerings and pricing strategies, including changes to care provider network composition, adjustments to membersâ€™ benefits and implementation or increases of member premiums. Operating cash flows are deployed to expand through acquisitions, reinvest via capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to shareholders by dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating operational flexibility and resource reallocation under stress. Resilience of its information systems and data security is supported by programs intended to detect, contain and respond to security incidents and by employee awareness training on phishing, malware and other cyber risks, thereby preserving system integrity. Management also evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances change and subjects finite-lived intangible assets to impairment tests when carrying values may exceed estimated fair values, thereby safeguarding financial strength and performance amid internal or external disturbances.

The Company’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to sustaining operations and performance under both nominal and extreme internal or external challenges, including extensive investments in research, development, training and education—such as simulator-based skills training, dual-console proctoring and remote mentoring—to absorb practitioner learning curves and reduce procedural errors; the creation of diversified revenue streams through capital sales, operating leases, instrument and accessory sales, and service contracts to generate predictable cash flows; the maintenance of substantial cash, cash equivalents and high-quality investments and the use of foreign‐currency hedging and customer financing programs to mitigate liquidity, credit and currency‐exchange risks; proactive quality and post-market surveillance systems, corrective and preventive action processes and field-action readiness to preserve product integrity and patient safety; broad regulatory engagement—through multiple global clearances, reimbursement advocacy and tender processes—to adapt rapidly to evolving trade, healthcare, tax and privacy laws and ensure market access; robust supply-chain and manufacturing risk management, including sole-source component qualification, safety-stock inventory and contingency sourcing plans, to guard against disruptions from natural disasters, political or economic volatility and unpredictable supplier failures; active monitoring of cybersecurity, data protection and network continuity to safeguard information systems; and strategic alliance, licensing and joint-venture arrangements that enhance the organization’s capacity for innovation, reconfiguration and resilience by leveraging external knowledge, shared risk, resource reallocation and dynamic capabilities across functions and geographies.

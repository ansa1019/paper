Abbott’s disclosures describe strategic initiatives and operational processes that support maintenance of integrity and performance under internal and external pressures, including cost containment efforts by governments, regulatory compliance activities and ongoing monitoring and investment in information technology systems and cyber security to mitigate risks of disruption and preserve business continuity. The company emphasizes its ability to acquire, integrate or dispose of businesses, form alliances and adapt its portfolio through acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere and subsequent restructuring to reconfigure operations, leverage economies of scale and reduce costs. Abbott maintains a diversified funding strategy, with sizable credit facilities, readily available lines of credit supporting commercial paper programs, strategic debt issuances and hedging arrangements for interest rate and foreign currency exposure, as well as active working capital management—including monitoring receivables, inventory, rebates, and allowances—to preserve liquidity and operational flexibility. The firm also highlights its processes for estimating reserves for rebates, charges, and tax contingencies, engaging external professionals for actuarial, valuation and audit-related support, and reviewing intangible assets, goodwill and post-employment benefit obligations regularly for impairment or remeasurement as part of risk assessment and resource reallocation. Abbott’s MD&A outlines its ongoing focus on sustaining cash flow from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividends, preserving investment-grade credit ratings, repaying and refinancing debt, funding pension obligations and maintaining compliance with evolving regulations, all of which serve to absorb strain from adverse events—such as regulatory actions, supply chain disruptions, market volatility, extreme weather, and cyber attacks—and to preserve or improve functioning and firm performance in challenging conditions.

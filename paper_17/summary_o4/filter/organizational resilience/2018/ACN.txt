The Company acknowledges that its scale and global scope pose significant management and organizational challenges which it must absorb and manage to preserve its business objectives. Maintaining effective standards across the enterprise and institutionalizing organizational knowledge, culture and core values, as well as managing and monitoring personnel, operations and communications, are described as key processes and tools that must be developed and implemented to sustain operational continuity and competitive positioning. The risk that employee misconduct or failure to comply with regulations may expose the Company to unacceptable business risks underscores the importance of internal controls and risk-mitigation mechanisms. Furthermore, the Company notes that periodic changes to its operating model in response to evolving business needs and size require successful implementation to avoid disruption of ongoing operations and diversion of management’s attention. The challenges of integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures, including dedicating additional management and resources, aligning organizational structures, assimilating personnel into the Company’s culture and retaining key executives, are identified as potential impediments to performance maintenance. Entry into new markets without prior experience or against stronger competitors is cited as another source of operational strain that could affect the Company’s adaptability and resilience to external pressures.

The Company’s 2018 Form 10-K emphasizes that all of its businesses “operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments” and warns that “online video distribution platforms are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior,” which the Company addresses through ongoing investments and adaptations such as deploying its X1 platform, adding third-party apps, launching new services (including security and automation), expanding high-speed internet, business services and wireless gateways, and pursuing strategic acquisitions (e.g., Sky). It recognizes that changes in consumer behavior “have been, and will likely continue to be…developed that further increase the number of competitors…and challenge existing business models” and notes that “if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.” To mitigate external pressures and maintain business continuity, it maintains “an extensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches,” while acknowledging that “network, information systems and technology-related events…could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services” and that “severe weather events such as hurricanes and wild fires…may result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, products, services, networks or information systems.” The Company further manages regulatory and compliance risks—stating that “failure to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could result in administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability”—and supply-chain resilience by monitoring third-party vendors to ensure uninterrupted delivery of hardware, software and operational support. It highlights the risk of economic volatility—“weak economic conditions in the United States or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services”—and addresses strategic resilience by noting that “in connection with such acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives.” Labor and talent continuity is managed through collective bargaining agreements, with caution that “if we are unable to reach agreement…employees may have a right to strike or take other actions…which could disrupt our operations,” and the Company recognizes that “if we fail to attract or retain on-air or creative talent…our businesses could be adversely affected.” Global operations are subject to “risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; the requirements of local laws and customs…and Brexit, including financial, legal, tax and trade implications,” all of which are addressed through ongoing monitoring, resource allocation and strategic foresight to preserve or improve performance under challenging conditions.

The annual report describes numerous initiatives and processes that support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including the allocation of significant resources to anticipate and respond to shifts in consumer preferences through product and packaging innovation and strategic investments, the deployment of shared services and information-technology platforms to simplify, harmonize and automate operations, and the optimization of manufacturing and distribution footprints to enhance operational flexibility and business continuity. It outlines an integrated risk-management framework—with board and committee oversight, cross-functional risk and country committees, a dedicated risk management office, internal audit and compliance functions—designed to identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate risks from natural disasters, political and economic volatility, cyberattacks, supply chain disruptions, commodity and currency fluctuations and regulatory changes, while preserving firm performance and brand equity. The discussion of productivity and transformation programs, refranchisings and joint ventures underscores the company’s ability to reconfigure trajectories, redeploy resources and adapt its business model in response to external pressures, legal and tax developments and competitive and sustainability imperatives, thus reinforcing the system’s integrity and ensuring continuity, recovery and longer-term resilience.

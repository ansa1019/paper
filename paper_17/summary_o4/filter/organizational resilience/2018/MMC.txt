The company’s disclosures reflect a multifaceted organizational resilience profile, encompassing its capacity to absorb strain and maintain functioning through acquisition integration, regulatory compliance, cybersecurity preparedness and business continuity planning. In its acquisition strategy, the company acknowledges risks in successfully integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated cost savings or synergies—facing higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings and a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties—as well as challenges in integrating information and technology, accounting, tax, financial reporting, human resources and other systems, assuming unknown liabilities, and avoiding impairment of goodwill if reporting unit performance varies materially from projections. The company is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions, including errors and omissions claims, anti-corruption laws, trade sanctions, data privacy regimes and competition rules, which consume significant management time and resources to build and maintain controls, procedures and policies and could materially impair results of operations, cash flows or reputation if compliance fails. Recognizing the systemic perspective of resilience, the company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, which are susceptible to external pressures from cyber-attacks, malware, ransomware and advanced persistent threats as well as internal threats from employee or vendor actions; it acknowledges that it may not fully detect or respond to incidents in a timely manner, that patch management, encryption, heightened monitoring and talent retention may prove insufficient, and that third-party or vendor breaches could expose its infrastructure and data to material disruption, financial loss or reputational harm. Finally, the company highlights its dependence on business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities—responding to disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, terrorist attacks, pandemics, power or telecommunications failures—by maintaining and regularly improving business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession, yet warns that a significant event or an inability to recover effectively could materially interrupt its operations, cause loss of client or company data, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

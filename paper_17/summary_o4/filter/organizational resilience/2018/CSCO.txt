The Company acknowledges that “our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations” and may be “adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment,” reflecting an ongoing need to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external pressures. To maintain operational flexibility and continuity, the Company “has been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services” and “expects to realign and dedicate resources” toward strategic initiatives such as security, applications, and the transformation of its business to deliver more software and subscription offerings. In managing supply-chain and inventory risks, the Company characterizes “inventory management” as an “area of focus” in which it balances “the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence,” and describes mitigation tactics such as securing memory supply and increasing component procurement efforts to address current constraints. It further notes that it “plan[s] our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels,” yet fixed short-term commitments may limit its ability to quickly reduce expenses in response to sudden demand shifts. The Company highlights the complexity of its distribution model, where it must “cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies” and depend on channel partners whose weakened financial condition could disrupt sales and margins. Recognizing the importance of resource allocation and risk management, the Company stresses the need “to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers” and the potential for component shortages or supplier capacity constraints to materially impair operations. In response to changing market dynamics, it “initiated a restructuring plan … to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas,” expected to be substantially completed in fiscal 2019. Its liquidity planning embodies a systemic perspective, affirming that “based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements,” including working capital, capital expenditures, customer financing and strategic acquisitions, thereby reflecting a multifaceted approach to absorb disruptions, reconfigure trajectories, and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

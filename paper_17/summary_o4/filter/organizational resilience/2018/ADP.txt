ADP has established disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect operations against events ranging from natural disasters and military or terrorist actions to power or communication failures, although such plans may not fully prevent or mitigate service interruptions, loss of client data or operational disruptions; the company maintains insurance coverage for data and cyber risks and devotes significant resources to safeguard personal and business information and client funds, implementing and continuously reviewing, upgrading and enhancing policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with anti-corruption, trade sanctions and anti-money laundering regulations, operating programs to prevent, detect and respond to evolving cyber threats, and investing additional resources as needed to enhance information security and remediate vulnerabilities. In support of its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity, ADP undertakes multi-year transformation initiatives, including a service alignment effort, the formation of a transformation office and a voluntary early retirement program, to streamline operations, extend global distribution, strengthen talent and culture and align client service operations to strategic cloud-based HCM platforms; throughout fiscal 2018 it continued to migrate clients to next-generation solutions and invested in research and development to anticipate evolving workforce trends such as the gig economy. Leveraging a strong recurring revenue model, healthy margins and solid cash flows, the company maintains disciplined capital allocation through reinvestments, potential acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders, while securing liquidity via a $9.8 billion committed credit facility, commercial paper program and reverse repurchase agreements to ensure access to financial resources necessary to respond to environmental disruptions, reconfigure strategies and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

In response to the June 2017 network cyber-attack that disrupted worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales, the company recorded significant remediation expenses, recognized lost sales and insurance recoveries, and has since implemented a variety of measures to further enhance and modernize its IT systems to guard against similar attacks in the future. The company is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to enhance the company’s resiliency against future cyber-attacks, including incidents similar to the 2017 attack, with the objective of improving the speed of recovery and enabling continued business operations to the greatest extent possible during any recovery period. It maintains insurance coverage for cyber-attack-related costs, despite disputes with certain insurers, and continuously monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of IT systems to reduce these risks. The company has also developed contingency plans to address operational disruptions arising from natural or man-made disasters—such as Hurricane Maria’s impact on its lone manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico—and geopolitical events, including uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, recognizing that severe weather, political instability, trade restrictions and regulatory changes could materially disrupt its business operations. More broadly, the company continually allocates substantial resources to research and development, external collaborations and legal defenses—defending patents against generic or biosimilar challenges and adapting to evolving healthcare reforms, pricing pressures and complex tax regimes—in order to absorb strain, mitigate risks of supply-chain interruptions or product shortages, and preserve or improve its functioning and financial performance under challenging and unexpected conditions.

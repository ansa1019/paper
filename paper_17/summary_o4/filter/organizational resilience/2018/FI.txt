The Company’s Annual Report identifies a range of risks and corresponding practices that implicitly support organizational resilience by addressing the maintenance of integrity and performance under adverse conditions. It acknowledges that unauthorized access, network disruptions, evolving cyber threats or natural disasters could disrupt the integrity, continuity and trust of its systems or data, potentially leading to costly litigation, financial liability, regulatory scrutiny and loss of clients, and therefore describes ongoing investments to modify and enhance its information security program, controls and incident-response capabilities. The report further recognizes that operational failures in hardware, software, data, networks or third-party services—caused by human error, cyberattacks, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications, fraud, political conflicts or terrorism—could interrupt service availability, cause data loss or revenue declines and damage client relationships, prompting the Company to maintain redundant systems, disaster-recovery plans and infrastructure reliability measures. The Company also describes the risk of software defects, development delays and integration difficulties, which could impair business operations and require diversion of resources to remediate errors and deploy robust quality-assurance processes. In addition, it details how a heightened regulatory environment—including Dodd-Frank, CFPB examinations and expanding cybersecurity and data-privacy laws—creates external pressures that necessitate modifications in contractual terms, additional compliance investments and adjustments to product roadmaps to sustain client capacity and preserve continuity. The Management Discussion highlights strategic initiatives such as active portfolio management, enhancement of operational effectiveness, disciplined capital allocation and service innovation as levers for adaptation to technological change, market volatility and competitive dynamics. It notes the complexities of mergers and acquisitions—especially the proposed combination with First Data—which demand substantial management attention, integration of complex systems, cultural alignment and contingency planning to avoid business disruption. Finally, the liquidity and capital resources section describes how the Company plans to fund operating expenses, service its debt, make capital expenditures and execute strategic investments through operating cash flow, revolving credit facilities and debt issuances, subject to covenants limiting leverage and requiring maintenance of specified EBITDA and coverage ratios, thereby underpinning the organization’s financial flexibility and ability to absorb external shocks.

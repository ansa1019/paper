Lowe’s has developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect its business, with oversight by the chief financial officer and development of risk mitigation controls and procedures for material risks. The company acknowledges that it may be unable to adapt its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address changing customer shopping habits, demands and demographics or to realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives. Its strategic focus on an omni-channel experience requires more integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing and demands that management, employees and contractors adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. Lowe’s customer-facing technology systems and those of its service providers are subject to ever-evolving cyber-attacks, power outages, technology failures or catastrophic events, and without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, the company may suffer data loss, interruptions to business operations and erosion of customer confidence. Disruptions in its domestic or international supply chain or fulfillment network—whether from political or trade policy changes, financial instability among vendors, labor unrest, pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages or shipping capacity constraints—could adversely affect results of operations, prompting the company to transform its supply chain by advancing fulfillment and delivery capabilities to enhance customer experience and operational excellence. Failure to hire, train, manage and retain qualified sales associates, specialists and corporate support staff with expanded skill sets could impair the execution of strategic objectives and adaptation to customer needs. Leadership transitions, including the appointment of a new chairman, chief executive officer and chief financial officer, can be inherently difficult to manage and may disrupt relationships with customers, suppliers, vendors and employees. Strategic transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures involve uncertainties and risks related to integrating personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully, and may give rise to goodwill impairments or other charges that affect earnings. To maintain financial flexibility and support strategic investments, share repurchases and dividend payments, Lowe’s relies on cash flows from operations and access to short-term and long-term debt markets, while comprehensive reassessments of the business, leadership alignment, inventory rationalization and targeted portfolio exits are intended to strengthen decision-making, execution and positioning for long-term success.

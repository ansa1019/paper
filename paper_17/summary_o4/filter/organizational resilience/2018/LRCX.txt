Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies is critical to our success and reflects our capacity to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions; this ongoing challenge arises from intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or economic conditions and increasing geographic expansion that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions, and our success in securing and deploying this human capital depends on the competitiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic, political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, the availability of qualified personnel, opportunities for career development, our ability to obtain necessary authorizations for international assignments and the provision of a challenging and rewarding work environment; accordingly, we periodically evaluate and adjust our compensation and benefit programs to preserve or enhance their competitiveness, recognizing that failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees could impair our operational flexibility, undermine business continuity, hinder our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and materially and adversely affect our operating results.

Throughout the annual report, the company describes its need to absorb strain and preserve functioning by scaling back operations, including drug development and R&D spending, if HIV or HCV sales fall short of forecasts, and highlights the difficulty in accurately forecasting sales and revenues due to variable rebate claims and fluctuations in non-retail purchasing patterns, wholesaler inventory estimates and international pricing dynamics. It notes that disruptions in third-party manufacturing, clinical research organizations or vendor relationships could delay clinical trials, cause product loss, impair supply continuity and harm reputation, while manufacturing problems and the suspension of single suppliersâ€™ facilities could lead to inventory shortages, shipment delays and regulatory setbacks. Political or economic factors that limit suppliers, legislative and regulatory actions requiring changes to business practices, pricing pressures from payers, and the introduction of generics and counterfeit drugs are identified as hazards that demand risk mitigation, operational flexibility and strategic adaptation to sustain competitive advantage. The report emphasizes that failures in accurately estimating demand, complying with global regulations including the GDPR, defending intellectual property, integrating acquisitions, managing litigation and attracting qualified personnel may undermine organizational health and resource reconfiguration, while natural disasters, cyberattacks or data security breaches could disrupt IT systems and core infrastructure, requiring resilience strategies to maintain system integrity, business continuity and performance under pressure.

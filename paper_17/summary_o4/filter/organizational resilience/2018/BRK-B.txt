Recognizing that organizational resilience involves the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, Berkshire has instituted a Board-approved succession plan that identifies and monitors subsidiary managers capable of succeeding key personnel to preserve leadership continuity under extreme or unexpected circumstances; our unusually decentralized business model entrusts qualified local management to oversee day-to-day operations and adapt to changing business or regulatory environments, thereby maintaining operational flexibility and continuity; we concentrate substantial cash, cash equivalents and U.S. treasury bills alongside a large statutory insurance surplus to absorb strain and support claims-paying ability, underwriting operations and capital allocation decisions while preserving liquidity and competitive advantage under adverse market variations; we employ business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate cyber and other disruptions, and we regularly adjust estimates for unpaid losses, loss adjustment expenses and catastrophe reserves to reflect emerging experience and reconfigure resource deployment as needed; our utilities, energy and railroad businesses manage significant ongoing capital expenditures and debt funding requirements, monitoring regulatory compliance and market access risks to sustain service reliability; and across all segments we strive for long-term sustainable growth by strengthening competitive advantages, diversifying operations, forecasting potential disruptions, repositioning resources and managing volatility in equity, interest rate, currency and commodity markets so as to preserve system integrity, performance and integrity even when confronted with pressures, constraints or failures.

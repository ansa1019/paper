NEE and FPL disclose a comprehensive framework of regulatory, operational and financial risks that collectively underscore their need to maintain operational flexibility, resource allocation mechanisms and rapid recovery capabilities to preserve critical functions under adverse conditions. They note that extensive federal and state regulation, and the potential inability to recover costs or earn allowable returns through base rates, cost recovery clauses or other mechanisms, may require strategic adaptation in planning and execution of capital programs, including the timing, budgeting and permitting of generation, transmission and distribution projects. Uncertainties inherent in development and construction—such as regulatory approvals, contractor disputes, labor issues and cost escalation—could force write-offs or delay investments, highlighting the importance of agile project management and contingency planning. The companies identify exposure to weather-related and natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods and extreme weather, which can cause infrastructure damage, service outages and significant storm restoration efforts that depend on regulatory approval and insurance recovery to restore normal operations. They also recognize that fuel and commodity price volatility, market liquidity constraints and counterparty credit risk in power and gas trading activities necessitate robust hedging strategies and risk mitigation tools to protect cash flows and firm performance. Further, reliance on complex information technology systems and third-party service providers introduces vulnerabilities to cyber incidents and operational failures, reinforcing the need for resilient IT architectures, backup processes and data conversion protocols to ensure continuity of billing, transaction processing and system monitoring. Capital market disruptions, credit rating downgrades or restrictions on access to debt and equity financing could impair their ability to fund liquidity needs, meet debt obligations and reconfigure financing plans in response to market shocks. Nuclear decommissioning and security mandates under the Price-Anderson Act and NRC orders impose additional obligations for long-term funding and operational readiness, including the management of refueling outages and compliance with evolving safety requirements. Collectively, these disclosures describe a multifaceted set of pressures—regulatory, environmental, technological, financial and security-related—that NEE and FPL must foresee, confront and manage through adaptive strategies, resource reconfiguration, and continuity measures to sustain integrity and performance under challenging and disruptive events.

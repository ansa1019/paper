Lockheed Martin’s annual report describes numerous practices that embody organizational resilience, including continuous risk assessment and mitigation through detailed contract-level cost and schedule monitoring and adjustments, active management of counterparty exposures and credit facilities to preserve business continuity, and the disciplined allocation and reconfiguration of resources—capital expenditures, independent R&D, divestitures and acquisitions—to adapt its portfolio to evolving customer and market demands. The company stresses inter-organizational collaboration and dynamic capabilities, leveraging international partnerships, joint technology efforts and cost-recovery mechanisms for environmental and pension liabilities, while maintaining financial flexibility via revolving credit, commercial paper and hedging strategies. Ongoing capital investments in facilities, production capacity and information technology, strategic workforce realignments and efficiency initiatives align the organization with changing economic conditions, sustain performance under pressure and ensure partial maintenance of integrity and function amidst uncertainty.

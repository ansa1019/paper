This report contains forward-looking statements based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity, and any statements referring to expectations, projections or characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are deemed forward-looking statements; our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business and have made investments seeking to address numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including monitoring networks and systems, hiring experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, and we maintain business continuity plans designed to address failures of IT systems or service providers to avoid reputational, competitive and business harm, litigation and regulatory action. We are in the process of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning system to replace many existing operating and financial systems, recognizing that any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in design and implementation could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices, track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. Our sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in the development, marketing and selling of new and existing products, and if we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive workforce, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives. We and our suppliers have manufacturing sites worldwide, and damage to these facilities or internal protocol failures could adversely affect product availability; in the event of interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand, potentially leading to loss of market share, additional expense and reputational harm. Our reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials, components and finished devices exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated price increases, particularly where materials are procured from sole-source suppliers, and regulatory requirements can impede timely validation of replacement sources. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, and we supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund activities as necessary, with our overall cash position reflecting strong business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations; operating cash flow serves as the primary source to fund operating needs and capital expenditures, with excess cash used to complement our portfolio through acquisitions. We maintain debt levels we consider appropriate after evaluating factors such as cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans and overall cost of capital, and we have existing credit facilities and a commercial paper program in place to ensure access to funds, while cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the United States are intended to be used to expand operations organically and through acquisitions. We maintain inventory reserves for excess and obsolete products based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected trends; our annual tax rate is determined based on income, statutory rates and tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes, and realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income, which management believes is more likely than not; we evaluate and adjust our tax positions for uncertain income tax items based on interpretations of complex regulations, audit progress and current facts. We test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and review other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that carrying amounts may not be recoverable, using fair value assessments based on the present value of projected future cash flows, and we record liabilities for legal and other contingencies representing managementâ€™s best estimate of probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate is not known, informed by consultation with legal counsel, prior settlement experience and settlement strategies; we are currently self-insured for product liability-related claims and expenses. Through these processes, investments, contingency planning and adaptive resource management, we seek to sustain performance and preserve integrity under internal or external variations and disturbances.

The Companyâ€™s comprehensive risk management program is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program. It maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and continuously monitors its systems while collaborating with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. Advanced monitoring systems are used to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors, and the Company manages its exposure to third-party risk by promoting a culture of resiliency through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing performance monitoring and appropriate testing. Operational and model risks are governed by policies and procedures that assign roles and responsibilities, utilize periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, internal audit reviews and model governance to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and ensure resilient decision-making. To preserve its capability to withstand liquidity stresses, Schwab conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and maintains a diversified array of funding sources, including contingency credit facilities and highly liquid investments, while maintaining policies and procedures to periodically test access to external funding. Schwab has adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios, regularly monitors capital forecasts and early warning indicators, and has implemented a capital contingency plan to address low probability, high-impact events, thereby preserving system integrity and its ability to absorb significant strain under challenging conditions.

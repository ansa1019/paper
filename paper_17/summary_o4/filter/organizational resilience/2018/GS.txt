Goldman Sachs maintains a comprehensive liquidity and funding policy to ensure that its core businesses can continue to serve clients and generate revenues under adverse circumstances by pre-funding potential cash and collateral needs and holding a diversified pool of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (“gcla”), supported by internal liquidity models such as the modeled liquidity outflow and intraday liquidity assessments.  Its contingency funding plan provides a structured framework for analyzing and responding to crises, identifying key risk factors and metrics, and outlining response actions should a liquidity stress or market dislocation occur.  A robust capital management policy defines objectives and guidelines for maintaining the appropriate level and composition of equity capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions, incorporating an internal capital adequacy assessment, stress testing under regulatory scenarios (including CCAR and DFAST), and resolution capital models to ensure sufficient loss-absorbing capacity and continued operations even under severely adverse scenarios.  These practices are governed by an enterprise risk management framework under board-approved risk appetite statements and overseen by senior committees (such as the firmwide enterprise risk, risk governance, and global business resilience committees), with independent risk oversight functions enforcing controls, performing independent price and model validations, conducting value-at-risk and stress tests, and reviewing counterparty credit exposures, thereby enabling the firm to identify, adapt to and recover from unexpected events, preserve system integrity, sustain performance under pressure and ensure operational continuity.

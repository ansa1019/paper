The company emphasizes that its ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies is critical to its success and competitive advantage, acknowledging that intense competition for talent, fluctuations in economic and industry conditions and geographic expansion can give rise to cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions that may challenge its ongoing functioning; it further recognizes that successful talent acquisition and retention depend on the attractiveness of its compensation and benefit programs, global economic, political and industry conditions, its organizational structure, the availability of qualified employees, career development opportunities, necessary work authorizations for cross-border services and the provision of a challenging and rewarding work environment; to maintain or enhance its adaptability and resilience under external pressures, the company periodically evaluates and adjusts its compensation and benefit programs for competitiveness, warning that an inability to effectively secure and motivate key personnel could impair its capacity to capitalize on market opportunities and materially and adversely affect operating results.

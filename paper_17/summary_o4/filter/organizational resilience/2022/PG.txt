The company’s annual report discloses a comprehensive risk-management framework designed to sustain continued operation and preserve performance under adverse internal and external conditions. In Item 1A, management identifies macroeconomic and geopolitical risks—including currency volatility, localized fiscal and trade controls, political instability, labor-market disruptions, sovereign credit risk, regional conflicts (notably the Russia-Ukraine war), natural disasters, disease outbreaks and cybersecurity threats—that may interrupt manufacturing sites, data systems, supply chains and customer delivery and that require mitigation through reserves, inventory safety stocks, business continuity plans, supply-chain optimizations (including sole-supplier arrangements and extended payment terms supported by supply-chain finance), hedging strategies and productivity programs. The report details forward-looking statements contingent on variable factors and outlines strategies to manage cost fluctuations in commodities, energy, labor and transportation through pricing adjustments, sourcing decisions, cost-saving initiatives and ongoing restructuring efforts. It describes operational flexibility measures—such as contingency planning for IT/OT failures, third-party relationship governance, organizational change programs, talent-management and leadership succession—to enable rapid reconfiguration of resources and preserve organizational integrity and reputation, while environmental sustainability, compliance programs and innovation pipelines serve as strategic tools for adaptive transformation. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing employs sensitivity analyses for discount rates, cash-flow projections and residual growth to assess potential valuation impacts from evolving market, currency and performance pressures, reflecting a systemic perspective on the company’s ability to absorb strain and maintain critical functions under challenging circumstances.

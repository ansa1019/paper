The Company’s 10-K disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining performance under pressure by investing in and scaling operational infrastructure—such as capacity planning for data centers, near-real-time data replication to alternate facilities, disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements—and by continuously enhancing business and data governance policies, internal security controls and risk escalation processes under the oversight of the Board, cybersecurity and privacy committee and executive management. Management acknowledges the potential for strain on personnel resources and infrastructure arising from rapid customer growth, the need to integrate acquisitions and technologies, and the imperative to upgrade internal systems and migrate to new platforms, all of which require flexible resource allocation, change management and operational adaptability. The Company highlights the need to mitigate risks from cyber-attacks, third-party service interruptions, defects or disruptions in complex service offerings, natural disasters, pandemics, climate-related events, geopolitical shifts and evolving regulatory requirements, emphasizing crisis management, emergency response capabilities and ongoing risk assessment to preserve system integrity, protect customer data, maintain organizational health and ensure continuity of services despite internal or external disruptions.

The company discloses that its business, results of operations and financial condition have been “adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,” noting that “the magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain,” yet “we continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply chain costs.”  To mitigate these constraints and maintain operational continuity, the company has “partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing ability and extending supply coverage, including, in certain cases, revising supplier arrangements,” paid “significantly higher component and logistics costs to secure supply,” “modified our product designs in order to leverage alternate suppliers, where possible,” and “continually optimiz[ed] our inventory build and customer delivery plans,” increases in inventories, inventory purchase commitments and inventory deposits and prepayments being recognized as necessary “to secure supply to meet customer demand.”  The company further records provisions for excess and obsolete inventories “based upon assumptions about future demand” and liabilities for noncancelable purchase commitments “consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.”  In response to external pressure from the Russia-Ukraine war, it “announced its intention to stop business operations in Russia and Belarus for the foreseeable future” and initiated “an orderly wind-down and exit” of such operations, reserving for “the non-recoverability of substantially all of our assets in Russia and Belarus” and recognizing non-recurring charges “related to non-recoverability of certain assets, special personnel-related charges in order to support impacted employees, and severance and other exit related costs.”  The report emphasizes that, despite “extended lead times,” supply-chain volatility and “uncertain geopolitical environment,” the company maintains a “strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position” and access to committed credit lines to “satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements,” thereby preserving its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

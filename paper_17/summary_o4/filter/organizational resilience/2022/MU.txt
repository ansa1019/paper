The Company’s disclosures underscore a broad range of capabilities and processes that support maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. For example, it acknowledges that “disruptions to our manufacturing process from operational issues, natural disasters, or other events,” including “power outages, improperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures,” “have occurred from time to time and may occur in the future” and “could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition,” reflecting the need for business continuity and operational flexibility. It recognizes that “our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant,” implicitly admitting the importance of adaptation to unexpected situations. To manage inventory and production variability, the Company states that in response to elevated inventory levels “we are selectively reducing facility utilization in both DRAM and NAND to reduce supply growth” and that “lower utilization and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs may adversely affect our gross margins,” illustrating strategic resource allocation and cost‐management resilience. Supply chain resilience is highlighted by noting dependency on a “limited number of suppliers” for critical materials, the risk that “constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments,” and that “trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, or public health issues such as COVID-19 may limit our ability to obtain such materials” or disrupt “transportation lines” and “equipment essential for our manufacturing processes,” all of which underscore inter-organizational collaboration and risk mitigation mechanisms. The Company further outlines that “the ongoing effects of the public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken…may include disruptions to our supply chain and our operations or those of our suppliers,” “impacts to customer demand, resulting in industry oversupply and declines in pricing,” and “reductions in, or cessation of operations at one or more of our sites,” demonstrating forward‐looking crisis response and emergency management. It describes conditionality of government incentives “upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations” and the risk of “reduction, termination, or clawback,” indicating pressures on strategic initiatives and investment planning. In discussing capacity expansions, it cautions that “delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities, or failure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures,” reflecting concern for recovery and transformation after disruptive events. Security and integrity of operations are addressed by noting that “breaches of our security systems or products, or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses,” that “cyberattacks are increasing in number and sophistication,” and that “unauthorized parties may gain access to our technology infrastructure and systems to steal trade secrets or create system disruptions,” all of which point to organizational health and systemic resilience strategies. Finally, the Company acknowledges that “climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions” and that “inflationary pressure will continue to be a headwind to costs,” recognizing environmental perturbations and cost variability while highlighting ongoing adaptation strategies consistent with maintaining integrity and performance under adversity.

Mastercard identifies information security and operational resilience as critical risk factors, noting that information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt its business, damage its reputation, increase costs and cause losses, and that service disruptions that cause the company to be unable to process transactions or service customers could reduce operational resilience and materially affect its overall business and results of operations. The company maintains “an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies,” and continues to enhance its controls, processes and practices designed to protect its systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access. It highlights threats such as cyber-attacks including ransomware, malicious code and phishing, state-sponsored actors and operational difficulties such as temporary unavailability of its real-time account-based payments network, and deploys measures such as privacy by design and data by design, foreign exchange hedging, liquidity and credit facilities, and settlement guarantees to support business continuity and mitigate disruptions. In response to external pressures—including geopolitical events and sanctions leading to the suspension of operations in Russia, the global COVID-19 pandemic and evolving regulatory requirements—the firm adapts its operational footprint, risk management activities and resource allocations, emphasizing continuous improvements to resilience mechanisms across its multi-rail solutions, integrated products and services, third-party relationships and global payments network to preserve or improve functioning under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

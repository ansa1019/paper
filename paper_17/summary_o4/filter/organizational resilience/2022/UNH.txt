The Company seeks to maintain organizational resilience through a dedicated information systems strategy “to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences,” periodically consolidating, integrating, upgrading and expanding its technology platforms “as a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions,” and recognizing that “if we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems … our business could be materially and adversely affected.” In support of operational continuity and risk mitigation, the Company has implemented cyber-security programs “to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents,” provides employee awareness training regarding evolving phishing, malware and other threats, and maintains “business continuation and resiliency plans which are maintained, updated and tested regularly in an effort to ensure successful containment and remediation of potential disruptions or cyber events,” acknowledging that unsuccessful remediation efforts “could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.” Financial resilience is managed through continuous forecasting and management of cash, investments, working capital and capital structure “to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility,” leveraging operating cash flows, regulated subsidiary dividends, committed credit facilities and periodic access to capital markets, which are deployed for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt reduction and shareholder distributions. The Company further strengthens its resilience by conducting annual or event-driven impairment testing of goodwill with quantitative discounted cash flow methods and sensitivity analyses, and by regularly updating actuarial liabilities for medical costs to absorb strain from claim delays and utilization trends. Human capital and strategic adaptability are addressed through executive succession planning, regulated relationships with key stakeholders, selective market entries subject to regulatory approval, and the management of strategic alliances and joint ventures to sustain performance under dynamic environmental pressures.

Starbucks results for fiscal 2022 demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our brand as the company faces a broad array of internal and external pressures—ranging from severe weather and natural or man-made disasters to supply chain disruptions, pandemic-related restrictions and labor market volatility—that could materially affect business continuity, financial condition and operating performance. To preserve operational integrity under challenging conditions, we actively manage our cash and investments, maintain diversified borrowing capacity through credit facilities and commercial paper backstopped by our revolving credit line, and deploy hedging instruments to mitigate commodity price volatility and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our reinvention plan and strategic initiatives—such as simplifying store administrative tasks, accelerating the development of alternative and purpose-built store formats, adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences, growing digital and loyalty capabilities, and investing in partner wages, training and support—are designed to enhance operational flexibility, drive sales leverage and sustain performance under pressure. We routinely update incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, engage in risk assessment of our supply chain partners and key commodity suppliers, and balance capital expenditures between new and existing stores, supply chain infrastructure and technology platforms to ensure adaptability and long-term, sustainable growth. Moreover, we address climate-related risks and evolving environmental, social and governance requirements through targeted sustainability goals, water and energy management, and enhanced reporting controls, while our disciplined purchase commitments, deferred tax asset evaluations and liquidity planning further strengthen our capability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve or improve functioning in nominal, extreme or exceptional circumstances.

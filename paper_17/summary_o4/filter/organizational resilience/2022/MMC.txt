The company identifies the risk that “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability,” underscoring its focus on business continuity and disaster recovery planning. It further notes that “if we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event … our ability to operate will depend, in part, on the continued availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations,” highlighting dependencies on operational infrastructure and workforce. The firm regularly “assesses and takes steps to improve our existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession,” and recognizes the risk that an “extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in our revenues,” with potential impacts including interruptions to service delivery, data loss, and reputational harm. In the cybersecurity domain, the company acknowledges the “threat of digital disruption and other technological change,” ongoing challenges in “implementing, maintaining and upgrading adequate safeguards,” and the potential need to take systems offline in response to a cyberattack, each of which may materially affect operations. The report also describes the dynamic external environment—marked by COVID-19, geopolitical uncertainty such as the war in Ukraine, and evolving regulatory requirements—all factors that may require rapid adaptation, reconfiguration of plans, and future orientation to preserve organizational coherence and maintain operational continuity. Its risk management framework addresses contingency funding, insurance coverage for business disruption, and pension plan funding strategies to mitigate financial volatility, illustrating mechanisms to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity.

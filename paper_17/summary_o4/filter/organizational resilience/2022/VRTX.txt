The Company identifies multiple operational risks and continuity measures that reflect elements of organizational resilience, including the adoption of a broad business continuity plan for natural disasters and catastrophic events impacting its headquarters and manufacturing sites in a coastal flood zone, with procedures for data recovery and corporate function restoration to avoid significant disruptions in research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization; reliance on a globally diversified supply chain of internal and third-party manufacturing and quality systems, subject to regulatory inspections and COVID-19-related interruptions, with ongoing investments in internal capabilities, contractual arrangements, and compliance with cGMP requirements to mitigate potential production or distribution disruptions; dependence on external service providers for pre-clinical work, clinical trials and other activities, together with the Companyâ€™s responsibility for ensuring compliance with standards such as good laboratory and clinical practices and its ability to replace underperforming contractors to prevent delays in development timelines and regulatory submissions; extensive use of information technology systems and network infrastructures, protected by security measures under the continuity plan, to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical data and operations amid threats ranging from cyber-attacks to natural disasters; maintenance of environmental and liability insurance to cover pollution conditions and unanticipated events arising from hazardous materials use; active engagement with regulatory authorities to sustain manufacturing and reporting processes in conformance with evolving health care, privacy and security laws worldwide; strategic allocation of management and other resources to build and maintain supply chains, quality assurance programs and reimbursement strategies across U.S. and ex-U.S. markets; and ongoing refinement of compliance, reporting and risk-assessment processes under programs such as the Medicaid drug rebate scheme and global data protection frameworks, all contributing to the ability to absorb strain, adapt to external pressures and regulatory perturbations, and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions.

The annual report describes multiple facets of resilience practices designed to ensure the company can absorb strain and maintain operations under adverse conditions, including the recognition that “we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities,” and that interruptions in third-party hosting or content delivery services, unexpected complexity during data center migrations, hardware or software failures, cyber-attacks or environmental and geopolitical events such as pandemics, climate‐related disruptions, power outages and the Russia‐Ukraine war could disrupt service delivery, damage reputation and result in customer losses.  It details the company’s efforts to mitigate these risks through continuous monitoring and enhancement of its information technology networks—such as engineering more secure products, code hardening, rigorous penetration testing, regular audits of security controls, incident response improvements and insurance coverage for cyber risk and technology outages—alongside capacity planning to manage rapid demand spikes on data centers, supply-chain vigilance to address pandemic- and conflict-related shortages, foreign currency hedging to offset exchange volatility, maintenance of substantial cash reserves and a committed revolving credit facility for financial flexibility, all of which enable the organization to adapt resources, preserve system integrity and sustain performance when faced with internal or external variations and disturbances.

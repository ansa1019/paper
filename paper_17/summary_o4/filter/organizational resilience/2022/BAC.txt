Bank of America’s annual report details a comprehensive risk framework and governance structure designed to maintain organizational integrity and performance under challenging conditions, including the establishment of contingency plans and a financial contingency and recovery plan that “outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events” and “provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines” to ensure operational continuity through shocks.  The report also describes “business continuity policy, standards and procedures … designed to maintain the availability of business functions and enable impacted units … to achieve strategic objectives in the event of a cybersecurity incident,” reflecting a systemic perspective on resilience that spans people, processes and technology.  Management’s discussion highlights the use of enterprise-wide stress testing under multiple macroeconomic scenarios to assess capital, liquidity and earnings sensitivities, as well as daily liquidity stress analysis that models potential outflows from “draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit,” supporting the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite market volatility.  Detailed descriptions of the three-line-of-defense model and a formalized role for the enterprise risk committee and board oversight articulate clear accountability for risk identification, measurement, monitoring and control, while strategic risk management processes ensure the firm can “respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments.”  The report further notes extensive investments in operational flexibility and support systems—such as remote access tools, digital banking platforms and third-party risk assessments—that help the bank adapt to unexpected disruptions in its computer, telecommunications and physical infrastructure, natural disasters or “systemic cyber events that result in system outages and unavailability.”  Collectively, these practices—including contingency funding plans, model validation policies, and a capital conservation buffer calibrated through the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review—demonstrate the organization’s capacity to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change in order to survive, grow and flourish.

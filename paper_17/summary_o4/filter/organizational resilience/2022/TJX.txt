To respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns, we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores, maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store and be flexible in our allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories; although our business model allows us greater flexibility to meet consumer product preferences and trends than many traditional retailers (for example, by expanding and contracting merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes), we may not successfully do so, which could impact inventory turns, customer traffic, and sales, and may add difficulty in attracting new customers, retaining existing customers, and encouraging frequent customer visits; meeting these expectations effectively generally involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed, among other things; our growth strategy includes successfully expanding within our current markets and/or into new geographic regions, product lines and channels, including e-commerce, and, as appropriate, adding new businesses, whether by development, investment or acquisition; growth can also add complexity to our business operations by requiring effective information sharing, significant attention from our management and other functions across our business, development of new capabilities, as well as appropriately staffing and training an increased number of associates and/or managing appropriate third-party providers; failure to effectively manage the large size and scale of our operations may adversely affect our financial results; the substantial size of our business can make it challenging to run our complex operations effectively and to manage suitable internal resources and third-party providers with appropriate oversight, including, for example, administration, systems (including information technology systems), merchandising, sourcing, store operations, distribution, logistics and compliance; the large size and scale of our operations, our multiple banners and locations across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia, and the autonomy afforded to the banners in some aspects of the business also increase the risk that our systems, controls, practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout our company, that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations, and/or that our marketing and communications strategies may lack cohesion; the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and in the future may have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations; during the first major peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in fiscal 2021, all of our stores, online businesses and distribution centers were temporarily closed, during which time we were unable to generate sales, though we continued to incur expenses; during that time, we also implemented new procedures in our operations, including enhanced cleaning protocols, occupancy limitations, and additional health and safety protocols that resulted in additional payroll and continued or increased expenses primarily during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, while potentially impacting sales opportunities; many of our stores have had, and in the future may again have, additional temporary closures, and many of our stores have been, and may again in the future be, subject to additional restrictions that adversely impact customer traffic and sales opportunities; in addition, market conditions and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and global supply chain have impacted and may continue to impact the financial viability or business operations of some of our suppliers and transportation or logistics providers, which has interrupted and increased costs related to, and may in the future interrupt and further increase costs related to, our supply chain, and could require additional changes to our operations; our ability to allocate, deliver, and maintain our preferred mix and level of inventory has been impacted in recent years by temporary store closures, inflationary pressures and global supply chain disruptions, including, for example, an increase in competition for limited shipping capacity and other operational and market changes related to the global pandemic; our business depends on our information technology (“IT”) systems, which collect and process information of customers, associates and other persons, as well as information of our business and of our suppliers, service providers and other third parties; we rely heavily on IT systems, including those operated and maintained by our suppliers, service providers and other third parties, to manage all key aspects of our business, including planning; purchasing; sales, including point-of-sale processing and e-commerce; supply chain management; inventory management; human resources; financial management; communications; information security; and legal and regulatory compliance; our ongoing operations and successful growth are dependent on these systems and require us to accurately anticipate our current and future IT needs, including successfully developing, implementing and maintaining appropriate systems as well as effective disaster recovery plans for such systems; we maintain policies, procedures and controls designed to reduce the risks of data security compromises and IT failures or disruptions, but such controls cannot fully eliminate these risks and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented; there is also a risk of material business disruption, liability and reputational damage associated with ongoing actions intended to update, enhance, modify or replace our systems and infrastructure, including from not accurately capturing and maintaining data, efficiently testing and implementing changes, realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the actions and diversion of internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented; and although we believe our flexible off-price model helps us react to such changes, shifts in the market may adversely affect our sales, cash flows, merchandise orders and results of operations and performance.

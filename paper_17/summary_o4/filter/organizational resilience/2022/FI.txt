The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize its need to maintain critical operations and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by investing in information security, controls and business continuity and disaster recovery plans, including frequent testing, to “preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.”  It acknowledges that unauthorized access, intrusion, infiltration or network disruption could impair the integrity, continuity, security and trust of its systems or data and notes that operational failures—whether from hardware or software defects, ransomware or other cyberattacks, human error, natural disasters, pandemics, power losses or other events—may interrupt its products and services, cause data loss, reduce revenue, harm its reputation and undermine client confidence.  The disclosures also recognize the interconnected nature of the global financial system and that disruptions in third-party operations, payment networks, processors, vendors or supply chains—such as factory closures, workforce shortages, component delays or increased lead times—could prevent delivery of services, expose the Company to financial, compliance and reputational risks and require rapid reconfiguration of resources to restore service.  The Company further highlights its reliance on contract renewals, competitive technological innovation and vendor relationships, noting that failure to keep pace with industry standards, gain market acceptance, renew or renegotiate contracts on favorable terms or replace key third-party services could materially impair its ability to retain clients and sustain revenue.  In sum, these disclosures describe a multifaceted resilience strategy encompassing risk mitigation, resource allocation, operational flexibility, strategic adaptation and recovery mechanisms to maintain system integrity, preserve organizational strength and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

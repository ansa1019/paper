The Company underscores its reliance on external partners and its proactive adjustments to preserve functionality and maintain positive performance under internal or external disturbances. It cautions that “we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected” and that “if essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected,” prompting the use of long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements to stabilize material supply. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company affirms that it “adjust[s] our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands,” “assess[s] our product schedules and roadmaps to make any adjustments that may be necessary to support remote working requirements and address the geographic and market demand shifts,” and “monitor[s] our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities,” while warning that workforce disruptions may “impact our productivity” and hinder its ability “to meet our product schedules, roadmaps and customer commitments.” The Company also identifies dependencies on third-party logistics, noting the need to “transition these functions in-house or secure new providers” to safeguard distribution and internal processes, and it highlights export control restrictions and Entity List sanctions that may “limit our ability to export our products to certain customers,” all of which require strategic adaptation, operational flexibility and risk mitigation. Finally, the Company presents its acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando as strategic initiatives to diversify technology platforms, reconfigure operational capabilities and enhance its capacity to respond to market disruptions and emerge stronger from challenging situations.

The Company’s 2022 Form 10-K discloses a range of strategies and operational capabilities that support its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of diverse adversities. It acknowledges that significant shortages, price increases or unavailability of raw materials, components and third-party services due to global supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, labor shortages, sole-source dependencies or regulatory constraints could increase operating costs, require significant capital expenditures or impede the timely procurement of electronic components, thereby adversely impacting its competitive position and ability to satisfy customer demand. The Company further describes that it may be unable to establish alternative suppliers in a timely or cost-effective manner largely as a result of FDA and other regulatory requirements, and that cost containment measures, weakened exchange rates and pricing pressures from government-sponsored initiatives and industry consolidation may constrain pricing flexibility and delay customer orders. To mitigate these pressures, it continues to innovate to address physician and patient needs, maintain close working relationships with key healthcare professionals, rely on indirect distribution channels and diversify its global operations across jurisdictions while continuously monitoring geopolitical events such as the war in Ukraine and pandemic-related travel bans, port closures and border controls. The Company reports that these events have required a significant and unpredictable need to adjust operations and resource allocation, including exiting certain product lines in particular markets, and that it has made targeted investments in information technology infrastructure and cybersecurity—monitoring networks, hiring experts, training employees and establishing incident response protocols—and is implementing a global ERP system to enhance operational integration, although any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in these initiatives could adversely affect order processing, manufacturing, distribution, services and overall business continuity. It also highlights climate-related risks and natural disasters for which it maintains third-party insurance, self-insurance reserves, contingency planning and business continuity measures, recognizing that damage to its facilities, suppliers’ or service providers’ sites could delay production, disrupt supply chains and undermine its capacity to reconstitute operations and maintain financial stability.

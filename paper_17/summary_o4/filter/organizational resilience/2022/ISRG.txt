The annual report underscores that macroeconomic conditions such as high inflation, volatile currencies, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, and labor availability fluctuations can materially impair the company’s business and its ability to deploy resources, noting it “may be unable to raise the prices of our products and services sufficiently” or implement countermeasures, which could impede operational flexibility and business continuity. It highlights risks from political instability and military hostilities, pandemic-related disruptions, and trade restrictions that may lead to supply failures in single-sourced components or insolvency of key suppliers, potentially causing “deferred or canceled procedures” and requiring mitigation through “increasing our communications with our suppliers and modifying our purchase order coverage and inventory levels.” The report details the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact—travel restrictions, facility closures, customer access reductions, shifts to remote or hybrid work that heighten cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and “operational risk, uncertainty regarding office space needs, … and changes to our company culture”—and describes a customer relief program providing service fee credits and deferred lease payments to preserve continuity. It identifies litigation, regulatory actions, intense competition, acquisitions, and geopolitical tensions—including the Russia-Ukraine conflict—as sources of external pressure that may divert management attention, increase costs, or disrupt operations. The discussion of human capital emphasizes dependency on key personnel, the challenge of attracting and retaining specialized talent amid a constrained labor market, and the importance of sustaining a corporate culture “that fosters innovation, teamwork, and a focus on execution.” The report also warns of natural disasters and climate-related events disrupting manufacturing and supply lines, prompting contingency planning, vertical integration investments, and “substantial resources” devoted to facility expansions, automation, and supply chain diversification to enhance resilience. In its MD&A, the company states that throughout the pandemic its priorities have been stakeholder health and safety, supporting customers’ clinical and economic needs, ensuring supply continuity, and “securing our workforce economically,” while continuing strategic investments in new products, facilities, and digital capabilities to strengthen its capacity to adapt, recover, and sustain performance under pressure.

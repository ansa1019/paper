Item 1A discloses that the companyâ€™s operations, including its supply chain and manufacturing, are exposed to disruption by natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, geopolitical conflicts, cyber incidents and other events beyond its control and that crisis management plans and contingency arrangements are employed to mitigate risks to product availability and business continuity, although their effectiveness cannot be guaranteed. The report further describes an integrated risk management framework that spans cross-functional, geographically diverse senior management teams, division and market risk committees, a central risk management office, internal audit, compliance and legal functions and dedicated board committees (audit, sustainability, compensation and governance) charged with identifying, assessing, prioritizing, addressing, managing, monitoring and communicating strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks across short-, medium- and long-term horizons. The board and its committees receive regular updates on top risks, consider potential impacts on financial condition and operational performance and retain direct oversight of critical areas such as cybersecurity, supply chain resilience and regulatory compliance. The company also details ongoing productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs, fixed-price contracts, derivative hedging strategies and a multi-year business transformation to migrate to enterprise-wide systems, accompanied by contingency plans for system outages, service-provider failures or other disruptions. Management continuously monitors economic, political, regulatory and retail landscape changes and evaluates actions to potentially mitigate unfavorable impacts, reflecting a systemic perspective, adaptive strategies, resource allocation and operational flexibility to preserve organizational integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

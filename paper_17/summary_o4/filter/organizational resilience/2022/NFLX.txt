“In our annual report, we acknowledge that “if we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected,” noting our ongoing efforts in scaling our international operations, streaming service, studio capabilities and technological infrastructure—including third-party cloud computing and our own content delivery networks—to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and legal environments and to maintain operational flexibility. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming and contract with third parties across creative, marketing, legal, finance and licensing disciplines, while recognizing that integration and partner performance challenges could impair our service. The “ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted our business, increased our costs, led to delays in content releases” and has created significant volatility and uncertainty, and “we will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations” in order to preserve continuity. We note that “any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations… could result in a loss or degradation of service… which could adversely impact our business,” and that “interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service.” We further observe that “if network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected,” and that we rely on flexible financing sources—such as free cash flow and revolving credit—to meet our content commitments, strategic acquisitions, technology investments and marketing programs while seeking to maintain service integrity and protect our performance under pressure.”

Berkshire Hathaway’s disclosures reflect a range of practices and resources that support the firm’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse or unexpected conditions.  For example, the company has “taken steps intended to mitigate” cyber-security risks through formal business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis designed to sustain critical information systems and operating assets in the event of sophisticated attacks or system failures.  Its highly decentralized operating model, under which individual business unit managers retain responsibility for underwriting, day-to-day activities and capital allocation decisions, is bolstered by a board-approved succession plan for its key decision makers and by robust recruitment, training and retention programs to ensure that qualified and competent personnel are in place to manage changes arising from evolving business and regulatory environments.  The firm emphasizes financial resilience through maintenance of substantial cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills—together exceeding $120 billion at December 31, 2022—and through a flexible debt issuance program across its parent, insurance, railroad and utilities subsidiaries, ensuring access to funding even under turbulent market conditions.  In its insurance operations, Berkshire applies disciplined underwriting risk-mitigation practices, regular loss estimate reviews and robust reinsurance and retroactive reinsurance arrangements to limit exposure to catastrophes, latent claims and extreme loss events, while capitalizing its underwriting float as a source of low-cost liquidity.  In its railroad and utilities businesses, the company invests heavily in capital projects and maintenance to preserve system integrity, meet reliability criteria and adapt assets to changing load, fuel and climate-related demands, including responses to wildfires, hurricanes, pandemics and labor disruptions under national collective bargaining frameworks.  During the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply-chain disruptions, Berkshire’s managers adjusted production, pricing and inventory strategies, redeployed resources and leveraged long-term supplier relationships to maintain operations, control costs and protect competitive advantages.  Across all segments, the firm’s emphasis on strong liquidity, flexible capital deployment, risk assessment and mitigation, leadership continuity, regulatory adaptation and infrastructure investment embodies the dynamic capabilities and systemic perspective associated with organizational resilience.

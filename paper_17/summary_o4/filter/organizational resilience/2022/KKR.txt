While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we can provide no assurance, and we make no representation, that our mitigation efforts—such as our business continuation or disaster recovery programs, which rely heavily on our internal financial, accounting and data-processing systems and on third-party service providers—will be successful or sufficient to prevent or limit harm from natural disasters, cyber-security breaches, operational errors, or interruptions in critical vendor services; public health crises, pandemics and epidemics may occur from time to time, which could directly and indirectly impact us by threatening our and our portfolio companies’ employees’ well-being and morale, interrupting business activities, supply chains and transactional activities, disrupting travel, and negatively impacting the economies of the affected countries or regions, and any such measures imposed by governments—such as quarantines, stay-at-home orders, limitations on travel or business activity, and border controls—could be reinstated and materially and adversely affect our planning, operations, portfolio management and overall business continuity; geopolitical developments and other local and global events outside of our control, including trade conflicts, sanctions, political instability, the russia-ukraine conflict and intensifying geopolitical competition, can periodically and adversely impact our and our portfolio companies’ businesses in ways we may be wholly ineffective in managing; periods of difficult market and economic conditions or events—such as tightening liquidity in equity and credit capital markets, rising interest rates, inflationary pressures, commodity price volatility, currency fluctuations or protracted economic uncertainty—may occur across industries and geographies, and may adversely affect the valuation of our investments, our ability to secure financing on attractive terms, our cost-of-capital, the cash flows and liquidity of our portfolio companies, our capital markets business, our ability to raise and deploy capital, and our operating results despite our efforts to hedge, manage or otherwise reduce certain market risks using derivative financial instruments and other strategies; we face operational risks from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions and reliance on manual processes, and our and our third-party service providers’ information systems and technology may not continue to accommodate our growth, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, system failures or errors, may be unsuitable for new products or strategies and may require substantial and increasing cost to maintain, all of which could prevent us from maintaining operational flexibility or meeting critical objectives under extreme or unexpected conditions; our success depends on our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and to recruit new talent, and the loss of services of our founders or other employees or partners could materially impair our ability to adapt to unexpected challenges or pursue strategic initiatives; and, given the scale and complexity of our global operations and diverse business lines, including newly acquired insurance businesses, a wide variety of regulatory, legal, accounting and tax developments—such as changes in accounting standards for fair value, insurance contracts or credit losses; evolving cyber-security, data privacy and anti-money-laundering regulations; heightened scrutiny of private equity and insurance activities by the sec, state insurance regulators and the naic; and trade sanctions and foreign investment restrictions—could require us to deploy additional resources, alter our operating practices, increase our cost structure or reduce our strategic and operational agility, each of which may adversely affect our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

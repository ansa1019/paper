The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize its need to maintain business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging and unpredictable conditions, including its ability to manage rapid global growth, continuously adapt to technological and market changes, and allocate resources effectively to new strategic initiatives. They acknowledge that external disturbances such as economic downturns, political uncertainties, terrorist attacks, extreme weather, natural disasters, wars, pandemics, or unforeseen government travel restrictions can dramatically and suddenly disrupt consumer demand, partner relationships, and service provision, requiring operational flexibility, crisis management measures, and rapid reconfiguration of business trajectories. The Company highlights its reliance on resilient information technology and outsourced global systems—investing in redundancy, security controls, disaster recovery, and cloud-based solutions—to guard against cyber-attacks, system failures, and third-party service interruptions that could impair service availability, data integrity, or customer confidence. It also describes efforts to enhance payment capabilities, expand merchant-processing services, and diversify its offerings to absorb strain and preserve functioning under evolving competitive and regulatory pressures, including digital services taxes, data privacy mandates, anti-trust investigations, and varying international legal regimes. Moreover, the disclosures note the critical importance of talent acquisition and retention, remote-work policies, inter-organizational collaboration, and ongoing organizational learning and strategic foresight to sustain firm performance, absorb volatility, and emerge stronger from crises.

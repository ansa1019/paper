Lockheed Martin’s 2022 10-K disclosures describe a range of organizational practices and strategies reflecting resilience in the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions: the company emphasizes the identification, management and mitigation of risks to its business despite the inherent unpredictability of risk and uncertainty; it monitors budget uncertainty, government shutdowns, continuing resolutions and debt-ceiling constraints that could disrupt program funding, contract starts or produce program cancellations; the firm leverages a diverse product and service portfolio to reduce the likelihood that cuts in any specific contract or program will undermine long-term performance; it conditions its operations on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations and, when necessary, self-funds program costs pending appropriations; it seeks to manage raw-materials supply risk through long-term supplier agreements, alternative domestic or allied sources, and elevated inventory levels, and deploys resources on supplier sites to improve oversight, accelerate $1.5 billion in supplier payments to support small and at-risk businesses, and prioritize supply chain visibility; it invests substantially in emerging technologies, cross-segment collaboration, digital-infrastructure transformation and workforce development to enhance operational flexibility, organizational capabilities, and maintain continuity under internal or external perturbations; it adapts work models to hybrid environments, manages leadership succession and the transfer of critical knowledge and skills, and retains employees with requisite security clearances; it operates an enterprise risk management program with threat detection and cyber-security mitigation plans, a global security organization and a counterintelligence and insider-threat program, and partners with peers and agencies to share intelligence; it maintains liquidity through cash from operations, revolving credit facilities and disciplined capital deployment in operating and financial resilience, including debt management, pension risk transfers via group annuity contracts, and share repurchases and dividends; it navigates complex industrial cooperation obligations, regulatory compliance, geopolitical and macro-economic disruptions (including the conflict in Ukraine, inflationary pressures and COVID-19 impacts) to preserve system integrity, adapt trajectories of response to disruptive events and maintain strategic foresight, all of which collectively support the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

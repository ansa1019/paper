The Company acknowledges that its organizational resilience depends on maintaining continuity and preserving operational performance under pressures such as supply chain constraints, natural disasters, health epidemics and geopolitical tensions. To absorb strain from sole-source components, “we have increased our purchase commitments and extended our demand planning horizon,” issuing non-cancellable, non-returnable orders and “working closely with third-party contract manufacturers” to mitigate shortages, extended lead times, and decommitments, and to avoid “prolonged manufacturing disruptions,” delayed order fulfillment, and cancellation of orders. The Company also adapts to “adverse economic and geopolitical conditions,” adjusting pricing, forecasting, and production capacity to address “unpredictability of supply” driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, trade wars, tariffs, and political tensions, and maintains “effective internal control over financial reporting” and alternative sourcing planning. It invests in “research and development” and “new product introductions,” collaborates with key merchant silicon vendors to “focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies,” and pursues “strategic initiatives” such as acquisitions, while acknowledging the risk of integration challenges. The Company’s risk mitigation framework includes “inventory valuation and contract manufacturer/supplier liabilities,” reserves for excess or obsolete inventory, and rigorous “demand forecasting” to preserve financial health. It also relies on “its direct sales force and channel partners,” bolsters support and services to deployed products, and maintains “high-quality support” to ensure operational flexibility and “effective crisis response” to interruptions in manufacturing, supply, logistics, or customer operations, thereby preserving functioning and positioning the enterprise to recover and emerge stronger from disruptions.

Throughout the risk factors and management’s discussion and analysis, the Company acknowledges its dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers in a fabless model and describes efforts to establish alternate suppliers and enter multi-year capacity commitments to secure supply assurance, while recognizing that natural disasters, climate change events, acts of war, health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (and related quarantines or closures), cyber-attacks on its own or its suppliers’ IT systems and trade or national security protection policies could disrupt operations, reduce available capacity, increase costs and demand significant management time and attention to reconfigure production, reallocate resources and maintain business continuity. The Company specifically notes that the COVID-19 pandemic compelled modifications to workforce practices—including a hybrid work model—and that retaining key employees, maintaining productivity and preserving collaborative and innovative culture under remote or on-site arrangements may present challenges that could impair organizational effectiveness under varying conditions. It describes investing substantial engineering and development time, funds and resources to understand customer feedback and specifications, incorporating such input into product launches and technologies, and making significant advance payments under supply agreements to align operations with demand and mitigate the risk of lost sales, excess or obsolete inventory. The discussion of environmental, health and safety compliance—including stringent automotive qualification processes, greenhouse gas emissions regulations and joint and several liability for contaminated sites—reflects the need to adapt manufacturing processes and invest in remediation efforts to preserve facility integrity and maintain operational continuity. Cybersecurity efforts are framed as a robust program aligned with international frameworks to identify and remediate vulnerabilities and defend against increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats, while acknowledging residual risk that material disruptions could occur. Addressing the cyclical and volatile semiconductor industry—characterized by rapid technological change, price erosion, short product life cycles and demand fluctuations—the Company emphasizes forecasting discipline, flexible manufacturing, inventory measurement at the lower of cost or net realizable value and adaptive capital expenditure management, with long-term contracts and diversified capacity strategies serving to partially buffer supply chain volatility. Finally, the Company highlights financial resilience measures—including management of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, staggered debt maturities under fixed- and floating-rate notes and commercial paper, capital return programs and tax planning for repatriation and R&D capitalization—intended to preserve liquidity and enable operational flexibility in the face of evolving economic, legal and regulatory uncertainties.

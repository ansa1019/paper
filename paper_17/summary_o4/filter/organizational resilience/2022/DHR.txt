The annual report repeatedly emphasizes the company’s efforts to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under a variety of internal and external disruptions, describing “the global spread of COVID-19” and the “unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities” as well as the preventive measures taken by the company, its communities and governments to mitigate those disruptions.  It details how the company “deployed its capabilities, expertise and scale to address critical health needs related to COVID-19,” including “developing and making available diagnostic tests for the rapid detection of COVID-19” and “providing critical support to firms developing and producing vaccines and therapies,” illustrating organizational flexibility and resource reconfiguration in response to adversity.  Risk factors note that the business is subject to “natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions,” “public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics,” “interruption in the transportation of materials,” “cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware,” “power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events,” and extreme weather or climate-change impacts that could “disrupt our supply chains and distribution systems” or harm “facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems.”  The report underscores disaster recovery and business continuity planning, acknowledging that system redundancy “may be ineffective or inadequate” and committing to ongoing investments in information-security and disaster recovery.  It describes efforts to “forecast and flex production capacity” in response to “fluctuations in demand, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities, labor availability constraints, natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions and governmental actions,” and to mitigate “the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets” or contract counterparty defaults.  The company’s geographic and industry diversification is portrayed as a resilience strategy designed to “limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country,” while its use of acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic separations (such as the planned spin-off of the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment) demonstrates dynamic reconfiguration of resources and organizational structure.  The report also details the ability to defend and adapt in the legal and regulatory arena—conducting internal investigations, defending tax positions before the IRS and other taxing authorities, responding to intellectual-property claims, and maintaining compliance with extensive global regulations—to preserve system integrity and avoid brittleness.  Financial resilience is reflected in strong operating cash flows, diversified funding sources including commercial paper and long-term debt facilities, disciplined liquidity management, and the capacity to reallocate capital and sustain dividend and pension obligations even under adverse economic conditions.  Across all operations, the company highlights continuous productivity improvement initiatives, strategic investments in research and development and sales growth, and ongoing risk-mitigation measures as mechanisms to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

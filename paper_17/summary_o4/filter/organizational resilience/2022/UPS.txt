UPS acknowledges that its business, financial condition and results of operations remain subject to numerous internal and external pressures—including the ongoing consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, significant supply-chain disruptions, economic volatility across more than 220 countries and territories, inflationary and geopolitical uncertainties, competitive shifts driven by technology-enabled entrants, climate-related extreme weather and regulatory developments, cybersecurity threats, and labor and benefit-cost fluctuations—that could materially impede its ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve its functioning under challenging conditions. In response, the company continually adjusts its business model and cost structure, allocates resources to productivity and transformation initiatives, and refines activity-based costing methods to optimize its integrated air and ground network; deploys digital capabilities and facility automation to enhance operational flexibility; manages fuel and currency exposures through surcharge programs and hedging strategies; and invests in IT security, risk management and disaster-recovery plans to uphold business continuity. It directs disciplined capital allocation to fleet, facility and technology projects—balancing replacement and expansion needs—while preserving liquidity via operating cash flow, access to credit markets and prudent pension and postretirement funding. Through targeted acquisitions, strategic framework shifts and ongoing scenario analysis, UPS seeks to reconfigure its capabilities, confront disruptive change and emerge stronger, thereby sustaining performance and organizational health under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

As of August 31, 2022, our global workforce of over 721,000 employees and extensive footprint present significant management and organizational challenges that may affect our ability to maintain effective standards, institutionalize and deploy knowledge, adapt strategies, operations, and culture in a timely manner, and effectively communicate core values, policies, strategies, and goals across diverse and remote environments. We must continuously develop and implement processes, tools, and internal controls to manage our enterprise, instill culture and core values, engage and retain personnel, and mitigate risks such as employee misconduct involving improper use of sensitive or confidential information or regulatory non-compliance, thereby preserving operational continuity, competitive positioning, and performance under external pressures and organizational complexity. Periodic changes to our operating model, including realignments of organizational structure to address evolving business needs and scale, require successful implementation to avoid disrupting ongoing operations and adversely impacting results of operations. We also face integration risks in acquisitions and joint ventures, where the size and number of transactions may divert management attention and necessitate the allocation of additional resources to assimilate operations, align cultures, retain key personnel, enhance controls and procedures—including those related to financial reporting, disclosure, and cybersecurity—and manage acquisition-related costs, all of which are critical to sustaining resilience, preserving functioning under adverse conditions, and emerging stronger amid growth, complex situations, and market volatility. Additionally, entering new markets in which we have limited direct experience or where competitors hold stronger positions may require strategic adaptation, resource reconfiguration, and enhanced risk assessment to maintain performance, safeguard business continuity, and ensure long-term organizational health.

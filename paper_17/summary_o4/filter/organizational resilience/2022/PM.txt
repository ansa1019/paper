The annual report details multiple organizational resilience measures and disclosures, including risk management and business continuity planning discussed in Item 1A and Item 7, such as the suspension and coordinated resumption of operations in Ukraine (temporary factory closure, employee evacuations, humanitarian aid, salary payments and alternative supply via contract manufacturing) and scaled-down manufacturing in Russia, continuous assessment of evolving geopolitical, regulatory and sanctions constraints, and development of contingency plans to address disruptions, asset impairments and operational continuity; it highlights reliance on third-party distributors, manufacturers and limited suppliers (particularly for electronic device components), diminished direct control over distribution and supply chain, and the need to mitigate single-source shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change-driven extreme weather, natural disasters and inflation, supported by environmental goals, partner standards and safeguards; the report acknowledges dependencies on governmental approvals, potential impacts of regime changes, civil unrest, sanctions, public health measures and embargoes on logistics, facilities and energy, and the possible ineffectiveness of business continuity plans and safeguards to fully mitigate such impacts; organizational transformation efforts include restructuring into four geographic segments to reinforce consumer centricity, accelerate innovation and deployment, extensive investments in scientific assessment capabilities and compliance programs, and strategic initiatives for integration of acquisitions (e.g., Swedish Match, Vectura-Fertin Pharma, Otitopic) while recognizing integration risks related to complex organizational, cultural and system alignment, intellectual property protection and risk assessment; these disclosures reflect the companyâ€™s adaptive strategies, risk mitigation mechanisms, dynamic resource reconfigurations, and ongoing monitoring to preserve system integrity, maintain performance under pressure and ensure capacity to absorb strain and improve functioning in the face of adversity.

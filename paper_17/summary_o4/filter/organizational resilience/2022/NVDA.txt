NVIDIA’s annual report details a range of capabilities and processes designed to preserve continuity and maintain performance under internal and external pressures, including long-term supply commitments with third-party foundries and inventory provisions, prepaid supply agreements and partner incentive programs to mitigate mismatches between supply and demand, and flexible channel management to adjust to fluctuating customer requirements. The Company employs comprehensive risk-mitigation measures—such as property and casualty insurance, structured internal controls and ERP system enhancements, and ongoing monitoring of its global operating network—to guard against disruptions from natural disasters, extreme weather events, geopolitical tensions, power or water shortages, pandemics and cyber-attacks, while adapting its workforce through flexible work and social distancing measures during COVID-19. Heavy investment in research and development, data center infrastructure and multi-year cloud service agreements, combined with routine reassessment of liquidity and capital resources—including cash, marketable securities and external financing—supports strategic initiatives and capital expenditures under adverse conditions. The report also describes agile responses to export control restrictions by transitioning operations out of certain jurisdictions, adaptive product transitions to reduce channel inventory, crisis management protocols for cybersecurity and data breaches, and structured integration processes for acquisitions, reflecting a systemic orientation toward organizational resilience, adaptability and the maintenance of core functionality and performance despite evolving disruptions.

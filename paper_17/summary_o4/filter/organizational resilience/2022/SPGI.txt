The Company’s disclosures emphasize the importance of business continuity and disaster recovery planning—including backup facilities for primary data centers, redundant systems and internal controls designed to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical information and digital assets—in order to absorb operational strain and maintain functioning under internal or external disturbances such as cyber attacks, equipment failures, human error, supplier outages, natural disasters, pandemics or geopolitical unrest. Although the Company devotes substantial resources to its policies, processes and technology assets, it acknowledges that its systems are not always fully redundant, that evolving cyber threats and third-party software vulnerabilities may defeat preventative measures, and that its disaster recovery plans and unoccupied or non-essential service restorations may not always be sufficient or timely. The Company regularly assesses and refines its business continuity plans and key management succession protocols, yet warns that any failure of its infrastructure—or that of its third-party service providers, including cloud-based suppliers—to recover effectively from earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, civil unrest, war, pandemics or other emergencies could materially interrupt operations, damage its brand and reputation, result in regulatory actions or financial losses, and impair its ability to adapt and preserve performance under extreme or exceptional conditions.

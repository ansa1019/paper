“Disruptions within our logistics or supply chain network, such as the industry-wide supply chain challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our ability to receive and deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair our ability to meet customer demand for products, and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs, and/or damage to our reputation. The execution of initiatives to expand our supply chain and enhance the interconnected shopping experience could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. Our systems and the third-party systems with which we interact are subject to and on occasion have experienced damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power and other critical infrastructure outages; computer and telecommunications failures; computer viruses; data or security breaches; cyber-attacks; natural disasters and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes; public health concerns such as pandemics and quarantines; military conflicts, acts of war, terrorism or civil unrest; inadequate or ineffective redundancy; and design or usage errors or malfeasance by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers. Although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts are not always successful, and delays in maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching could impair their effectiveness or expose us to security risks. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences, potentially adversely impacting our sales and relationship with our customers. The coordinated operation of our network of physical stores, distribution facilities, and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our interconnected strategy, and failure to provide a relevant or effective online customer experience in a timely manner that keeps pace with technological developments and dynamic customer expectations could adversely affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share. We rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, process, retain, manage, transmit, and protect transactions and data; we have implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes, and procedures; third-party assessments and testing; and annual associate training to protect against unauthorized access, data loss, and security breaches, but the ever-evolving threats mean we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes and overall security environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, relying on cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets to support operating requirements, strategic investments in our supply chain and operations, and our dividend and share repurchase programs. We depend on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified associates and to manage strategic initiatives effectively, including investments to streamline operations, simplify customer interactions, and create an efficient delivery network; inability to choose the right investments, implement them at the right pace, or attract and retain necessary talent could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our competitive position and financial condition. In addition, factors beyond our control—such as adverse economic conditions in the housing and home improvement markets, inflationary pressures, weather and natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, public health issues, and regulatory changes—could impair our ability to adapt and maintain continuity, leading to increased costs, disruptions, or losses, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

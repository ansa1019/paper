During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the majority of Nike brand and Converse contract manufacturers in Vietnam and Indonesia were subject to government‐mandated shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the loss of approximately three months of production, elevated inventory levels and extended inventory transit times that constrained available product supply throughout the year; to mitigate these impacts, our teams are continuing to leverage our operational playbook, including balancing inventory across geographies, undertaking strategic pricing actions and employing a seasonless product approach. We continue to monitor pandemic developments and have incorporated related assumptions into our operating, financial and tax planning projections, and we believe our diversified manufacturing base, network of distribution centers, disaster recovery and business continuity planning, and investments in information technology systems and digital platforms provide the operational flexibility to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite disruptions. Although our global foreign exchange risk management program, supported by the Nike Trading Company and our factory currency exposure index, is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our cost of sales and consolidated results of operations, we acknowledge that extreme weather conditions, natural disasters or other regional crises could still have a material adverse effect if we are unable to secure alternative suppliers, replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair critical supply or information systems. Our substantial credit and liquidity facilities, combined with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and disciplined capital expenditure plans, underpin our ability to allocate financial resources for operational continuity, strategic initiatives and resilience strategies, enabling us to adapt to geopolitical, environmental, regulatory and market pressures—including climate-related risks, trade policy changes and evolving consumer behaviors—to maintain performance and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

Merck is working cross-functionally across the globe to monitor and mitigate interruptions to business continuity resulting from the war between Russia and Ukraine, including its impact on Merckâ€™s supply chain, operations and clinical trials, while continuing to supply essential medicines and vaccines and donating profits from its operations in Russia to humanitarian causes; the company also believes that global health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, even as ongoing COVID-19 and macroeconomic disruptions continue to strain its supply chain with delays in raw materials and packaging and related cost inflation that may affect its ability to meet demand.  To mitigate market risk from foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, Merck deploys hedging agreements such as currency forwards, options and collars, as well as balance-sheet and net-investment hedges, although these strategies may be costly and not always successful, and it continually adjusts its monetary asset and liability exposures.  Recognizing the threat of technology-driven hazards, the company has become increasingly dependent on sophisticated IT systems and cloud service providers and therefore monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage on an ongoing basis to reduce the risk of cyber-attacks or manipulation that could disrupt manufacturing, research or sales operations or compromise critical information.  Through a global restructuring program designed to optimize its manufacturing and supply network and streamline its real estate footprint, Merck is reconfiguring its operations, reducing complexity and realizing targeted cost savings to strengthen operational flexibility and its ability to reallocate resources rapidly.  At the same time, the company acknowledges that adverse events such as natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, health-care reforms, regulatory changes or unanticipated safety concerns could heighten existing risks and materially impair its business, requiring continuous risk assessment, adaptive resource deployment and resilience strategies to preserve integrity, maintain performance under pressure and support long-term value creation.

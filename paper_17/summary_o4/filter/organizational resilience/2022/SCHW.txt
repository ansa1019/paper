The 10-K describes a comprehensive risk management framework and governance structure designed to maintain business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including operational, compliance, credit, market and liquidity risk committees that identify, assess, measure, monitor and escalate emerging risks; policies and procedures to ensure system integrity, compliance and incident response; disaster-recovery and business-continuity plans with geographically dispersed backup facilities and routine testing; information-security defenses against evolving cyber threats and fraud; third-party risk management and contingency arrangements to mitigate service disruptions such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic; reliance on multiple funding sources—including client cash sweep features, secured and unsecured credit lines, brokered certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements and a universal shelf registration—to preserve liquidity under stress; regular liquidity and capital stress testing and a capital contingency plan to address low-probability, high-impact events; active balance-sheet management with transfers of off-balance-sheet sweep deposits as capital permits; diversification of investment portfolios and duration management to moderate interest-rate sensitivity; proactive planning for the phase-out of LIBOR and fallback provisions in contracts; integration initiatives for large acquisitions (e.g., TD Ameritrade) that include detailed transition groups, expanded client-service staffing and professional-services support to reconstitute and reconfigure operations without compromising client experience; and disciplined capital return strategies, earnings stress scenarios and forward-looking scenario modeling to preserve organizational strength, operational flexibility and the ability to absorb strain while sustaining core functions and positioning the firm for future market volatility.

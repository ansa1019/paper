Chubb’s 10-K acknowledges its substantial exposure to “natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, such as terrorism or cyber-attack, and other catastrophic events, including pandemics,” whose “incidence and severity” are “inherently unpredictable” and may be exacerbated by climate-driven shifts in weather patterns. To preserve system integrity and maintain performance under pressure, the company “seeks to manage [its] loss exposure by maintaining a disciplined underwriting process,” establishes “reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses” through complex actuarial methods, and deploys a toolkit of mitigation measures—including underwriting controls, predictive risk models, stress-testing, third-party reinsurance and retrocessional protection, excess-of-loss structures, collateral arrangements, and geographic diversification—to absorb strain and reduce volatility. Chubb further evaluates catastrophe probable maximum losses using “modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting)” and adjusts its global property catastrophe reinsurance program and terrorism coverages “prior to each renewal date,” while conducting stress tests against climate change scenarios to anticipate emerging hazards. The organization’s profit-center structure grants each senior management team the autonomy to “make operating decisions and create products and coverages” tailored to local markets, fostering operational flexibility, strategic adaptation, and the development of managerial talent. Liquidity and continuity planning are reinforced by a portfolio of “liquid, investment grade fixed income securities” duration-matched to liabilities, international multi-currency “notional cash pooling” arrangements, and a syndicated letter-of-credit facility, all supplemented by credit facilities and equity capacity to meet unforeseen claim demands and preserve organizational health and performance in exceptional conditions.

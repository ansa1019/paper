The annual report underscores the company’s exposure to a wide range of operational, strategic and environmental disruptions that could impair its ability to maintain performance and integrity under pressure, noting in particular the risks of inaccurately forecasting product demand or manufacturing levels, reliance on third‐party sites and single suppliers whose disruptions can delay or constrain production and commercialization, and the requirement for additional time and resources to scale new automated and viral vector manufacturing facilities. It recognizes that fluctuations in non‐retail sector purchasing patterns, budgetary cost-containment measures and channel inventory mismatches may cause quarter-to-quarter variability in earnings and a mismatch between prescription demand and revenues, while the outsourcing of clinical trials to CROs over which the company has limited control, as well as its dependence on key materials from sole suppliers, expose it to potential delays, interruptions in the commercial supply chain and the need for recovery and reconfiguration of operations. The report further highlights the impact of epidemic or pandemic outbreaks on global supply chains, logistics and workforce safety; the threat of natural disasters—such as the seismic risk in California—to business continuity; and external pressures from competition, government price-control and reimbursement reforms, importation of diverted or counterfeit products and evolving regulatory regimes for manufacturing, anti-bribery and ESG disclosures. These factors collectively necessitate dynamic risk mitigation, resource reallocation, strategic adaptability, contingency planning and robust governance to preserve operational continuity, performance maintenance and organizational strength under challenging conditions.

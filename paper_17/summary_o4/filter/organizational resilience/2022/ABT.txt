Abbott has demonstrated organizational resilience through its ability to manage complex global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, offsetting cost increases through targeted supply chain actions while maintaining operational continuity without significant shortages of raw materials, supplies or services. The Company mobilized cross-functional teams to develop, launch and scale new diagnostic testing platforms under emergency use authorizations, reconfigured its manufacturing network in response to shifting testing demand, and reallocated production capacity during its pediatric nutrition recall by shipping product from its Ireland facility, prioritizing its Ohio plant, converting liquid manufacturing lines, increasing output in Arizona and importing product from Spain in order to preserve product availability. Abbott invests continuously in sophisticated information technology systems, data protection measures and ongoing cyber-risk monitoring to mitigate potential disruptions, and sustains liquidity and financial flexibility by generating operating cash flows that exceed capital expenditures and dividends, maintaining an investment-grade credit rating supported by unused multi-year credit facilities, managing indebtedness maturities with available cash and executing restructuring plans to streamline operations, improve cost efficiencies, integrate acquisitions and support strategic initiatives. In parallel, the Company commits substantial resources to research and development, employs hedging strategies to mitigate foreign exchange and commodity risks, and continually monitors regulatory and market developments to adapt its operating model and preserve firm performance under adverse and rapidly changing external conditions.

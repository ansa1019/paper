The company acknowledges that disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in production and delivery of merchandise to warehouses, adversely affecting sales and member satisfaction. It undertakes large technology and IT transformation projects and emphasizes the need to build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, viruses, security breaches, employee errors and catastrophic events, noting that substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing digital resiliency are in progress and that failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to the business. While cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate threats, there can be no guarantee that implemented controls will fully protect systems, networks and data, and material cybersecurity incidents could result in reputational damage, litigation, operational disruption, unauthorized data release and loss of member confidence. Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could negatively affect operations and financial performance by causing physical damage to properties, limitations on operating hours, facility closures, workforce shortages, IT system disruptions, supply chain interruptions, transport delays and product availability reductions. Public health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its highly unpredictable and volatile impacts on consumer behavior, supply chains, labor availability, inventory access, logistics, strategic initiatives and financial performance, could require temporary suspension of operations and heighten other risks such as technology systems disruption, payment-related risks and regulatory requirements. The company has made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of its supply chains and delivery channels, while noting that such initiatives can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not yield anticipated benefits or desired returns. In managing risk, the company funds employee health care and liability claims predominantly through self-insurance, maintains insurance coverage and reinsurance programs to limit exposures from catastrophic losses, and estimates retained liabilities based on historical claims experience and actuarial assumptions, acknowledging that actual claims and costs may differ significantly. Management believes that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, operating cash flows and available credit facilities will be sufficient to meet liquidity and capital requirements, including planned capital expenditures of approximately $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2023 for land, buildings, equipment, information systems and initial warehouse operations, thus supporting the companyâ€™s capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning and respond to external variations and disturbances.

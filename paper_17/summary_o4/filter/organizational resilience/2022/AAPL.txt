In its 10-K risk disclosures, the company acknowledges exposure to macroeconomic and industry disruptions—including adverse global and regional economic conditions, trade disputes, inflation, pandemics, natural and industrial disasters, cybersecurity attacks and other business interruptions—that can materially disrupt its global supply chain and operations. It states that it continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities, employs demand-based forecasting whereby outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, and has invested in manufacturing process equipment and made prepayments under long-term supply agreements to help ensure supply resilience while recognizing that following an interruption to its business it can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. The company discloses that system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate and that its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities, that it uses derivative instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, records write-downs for obsolete or excess inventory, and reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. It also reports that it has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and to mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, and invests in programs to enhance reseller sales, staffing, research and development, and talent retention, reflecting strategic resource allocation and dynamic capabilities aimed at maintaining organizational integrity and performance under internal or external pressures.

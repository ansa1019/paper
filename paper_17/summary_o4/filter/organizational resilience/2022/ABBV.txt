AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines and monitors clinical trial sites locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to public health outbreaks such as COVID-19, AbbVie modified certain of its business practices and may take further actions required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of its employees, patients, customers and business partners, although the extent and duration of the adverse impacts remain uncertain. Following the closing of the Allergan acquisition in 2020, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization, realizing $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022 and incurring cumulative charges of $2.3 billion through 2022 to achieve these integration objectives. In response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, AbbVie continues to supply essential pharmaceutical products in Russia for humanitarian reasons while working to maintain compliance with evolving sanctions and has suspended operations for all aesthetic products in Russia. AbbVie relies on raw materials and components in its manufacturing processes that may be sourced from single suppliers and acknowledges that supplier failure, regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption could impair its ability to deliver products on a timely and competitive basis, noting that identifying alternative suppliers may require significant time, expense and regulatory approval and that business interruption insurance may not provide adequate compensation. AbbVie depends on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and recognizes that if these distributors encounter financial or other difficulties, decrease their business with AbbVie, or fail to pay amounts owed, AbbVieâ€™s business and results could be adversely affected. AbbVie relies on suppliers, vendors and other third-party service providers to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, promote and sell its products, and acknowledges that the failure of a critical third-party provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on its operations and results. AbbVie maintains a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility to secure liquidity on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates, believes it has sufficient flexibility to meet short- and long-term obligations through cash, operational cash flows and access to capital markets, while noting that a material decline in demand, deterioration in credit ratings or other unfavorable changes could affect its ability to generate cash or access financing. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software and complex information technology systems to operate and has invested in data protection and ongoing monitoring, but acknowledges that malicious intrusion, data privacy breaches, system disruption or breakdown could materially harm its operations and that its cyber insurance may not fully cover resulting losses. AbbVie normally responds to challenges to its intellectual property by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing infringement lawsuits, reflecting a strategic defense to preserve exclusivity and protect its revenue streams.

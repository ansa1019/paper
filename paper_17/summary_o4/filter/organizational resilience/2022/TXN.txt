Risk factor disclosures emphasize susceptibility to macroeconomic downturns, volatility in general market conditions and currency fluctuations and underscore potential disruptions from geopolitical tensions, tariffs, import/export restrictions and security risks—including acts of war, terrorism, epidemics and climate-related events—that may impede product delivery, customer support and manufacturing continuity. The company identifies dependencies on third-party suppliers and critical materials as risk vectors that could lead to inventory imbalances, quality excursions or capacity shortages, while noting that manufacturing forecasts based on multiple assumptions risk resulting in excess, obsolete or insufficient inventory, thereby affecting profit margins and operational performance. Cybersecurity events and breaches, whether affecting internal systems or those of suppliers and customers, are recognized as evolving threats that can compromise data integrity, disrupt operations and impose remediation costs. The firm further acknowledges that rapid technological change necessitates significant R&D and capital investments, that failure to implement strategic, business and organizational changes—such as acquisitions, divestitures, capacity expansions and restructurings—could adversely impact its competitive positioning, and that reliance on key talent retention and recruitment is critical to sustaining operational flexibility. Natural occurrences, including severe weather, geological hazards and the COVID-19 pandemic, have engendered constrained supply and demand volatility, prompting the company to manage its operating plan and expenses with a steady hand while preserving critical functions. To bolster its resilience, management details disciplined capital allocation, targeted investments in manufacturing and technology—augmented by incentives under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act—and prudent liquidity management, including the generation of substantial free cash flow, maintenance of cash and short-term investments, and access to revolving credit facilities, to ensure funding for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and debt obligations and thereby maintain integrity and performance under varying internal and external conditions.

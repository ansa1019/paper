The company’s disclosure acknowledges that demand for products and services can fluctuate significantly due to seasonality, promotions, global economic conditions, public health crises, extreme weather, geopolitical events and other unforeseen circumstances that it “may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control,” which may place increased strain on operations and materially affect business continuity, financial condition, operating results and growth. To address this variability and absorb internal or external disturbances, the company invests in expanding and optimizing its fulfillment network and data centers, strengthening technology infrastructure and process efficiencies, maintaining a lean culture, diversifying internationally, negotiating better supplier terms and offering shipping and membership benefits as strategic tools. It maintains policies and processes to mitigate fraud, security breaches and system interruptions in its digital and logistics platforms, leverages scalable infrastructure and resource allocation across its North America, international and AWS segments, and relies on forward-looking statements and dynamic planning to reconfigure responses, preserve functionality and support recovery and future orientation under adverse conditions—an approach that reflects the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

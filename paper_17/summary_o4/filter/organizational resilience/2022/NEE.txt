NEE and FPL have implemented comprehensive risk management and operational continuity measures designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity, including the use of derivative instruments as economic hedges to mitigate fuel and energy price volatility, extensive insurance and regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms to fund storm restoration and asset decommissioning, and targeted reserve funds to support service restoration following hurricanes Ian and Nicole. In anticipation of extreme weather and supply chain disruptions for solar panels, they winterize critical equipment, modify plant operations, expand load-shedding options and monitor global procurement channels to reduce project delays and cost overruns. Physical and cyber security protocols, credit and collateral arrangements, master netting agreements and internal controls safeguard information systems, energy infrastructure and customer data from cyberattacks, terrorism and counterparty defaults. Through diversified liquidity sources—cash flows, syndicated and bilateral credit facilities, debt and equity issuances, guarantee arrangements and payment-certainty clauses—they maintain access to capital markets, meet liquidity needs and fund new investments in renewable generation, transmission expansion and nuclear facility obligations. Operational risk assessments encompassing facility start-ups, fuel availability, environmental compliance, permitting challenges and workforce continuity help FPL and NEE reconfigure resources, respond to regulatory changes, and recover from unplanned outages or interruptions, thereby supporting ongoing performance, strategic flexibility and resilience in a turbulent business environment.

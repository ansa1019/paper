The company describes its digital-operations transformation—enabled by the Now Platform—as increasing customers’ resiliency and security while delivering enhanced experiences and value, and it recognizes that its own operations are exposed to interruptions from natural disasters (including droughts, wildfires, floods, extreme weather and power outages), pandemics, terrorism, political unrest, cyberattacks and other catastrophic events; although it maintains crisis management and disaster response plans and invests in interconnectivity between data centers, data backup and disaster recovery services, and expanded capacity, it cautions that such events could make service delivery difficult or impossible, adversely affecting business continuity, customer satisfaction and financial performance. To address evolving hazards, the company devotes significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures and a data governance framework, to mitigate increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats—while acknowledging that unanticipated techniques or vulnerabilities may still cause breaches, service disruptions, regulatory investigations, fines, reputational harm or loss of customers. It also seeks to mitigate climate-related risks through robust environmental programs as part of its ESG strategy and partnerships focused on resilience, even as its primary facilities remain vulnerable to water scarcity, heat waves, air quality impacts and power shutoffs. Finally, the company highlights its ability to generate positive operating cash flows for over a decade and to maintain cash, cash equivalents and investments sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, reflecting resource allocation decisions designed to preserve operational flexibility, support ongoing innovation and enable adaptation to evolving regulatory and market demands.

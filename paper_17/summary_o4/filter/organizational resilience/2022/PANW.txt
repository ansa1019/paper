In the “Risk Factors” disclosure, we describe how our operations and financial results are subject to rapid and unpredictable changes—from the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions to geopolitical events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—and how we have responded with measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus and minimize risk to our employees, channel partners, end-customers, and communities, including a flexwork program allowing employees to work from home or in the office for set days each week, with the company continuously monitoring the situation and adjusting policies as public health guidance evolves; we acknowledge that these precautionary measures, together with increased supply chain challenges—such as chip and component shortages that have led to extended delivery times, higher costs, and forecasting challenges—have forced us to reprioritize engineering and R&D efforts and adjust our product roadmap in order to preserve integrity and performance under pressure. We further recognize that to maintain business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, we must continually improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently across the organization; failure to do so could increase costs, disrupt customer relationships, limit deployments, or otherwise harm our business performance. We also disclose that our reliance on manufacturing partners exposes us to logistics delays, pricing fluctuations, and risks associated with limited component supply—any of which could delay revenue or cause lost sales opportunities—and we must manage these complexities through proactive risk mitigation, alternative sourcing strategies, and ongoing adaptation to external pressures, including changes in trade agreements, sanctions, regulatory controls, currency fluctuations, and environmental or health crises. Finally, we note that strategic initiatives such as acquisitions, while aimed at strengthening our competitive position and capabilities, require significant management attention and careful integration to avoid disruption and ensure they contribute positively to our long-term resilience, system integrity, and sustained firm performance under adversity.

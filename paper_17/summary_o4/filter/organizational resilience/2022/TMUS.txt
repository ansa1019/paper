Our disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to maintaining business continuity and adapting under challenging conditions through ongoing investment in network quality and capacity, the rationalization and decommissioning of redundant assets, the migration of customers to enhanced platforms, and the realization of merger synergies by eliminating duplicative processes and functions across retail, network, IT, and back‐office operations. We emphasize the need to adapt to technological developments and external pressures by continually investing in our nationwide 5G network, spectrum acquisitions, and new offerings to meet changing customer demands, as well as by implementing restructuring initiatives—contract terminations, severance programs, small cell and DAS decommissions—to secure cost efficiencies and preserve organizational performance under adversity. Our risk management framework recognizes the potential for system failures, cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, geopolitical instability, regulatory changes, and market consolidation to disrupt operations, and accordingly we maintain preventative actions, enhanced safeguards, and multi‐year cybersecurity investments to repel cyberattacks, identify, investigate and remediate incidents, and uphold service reliability. We monitor macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, review liquidity sources, and execute proactive measures—such as off‐balance‐sheet securitizations and financing leases—to ensure sufficient funding for capital expenditures, spectrum auctions, and regulatory commitments, while recognizing that the timing and magnitude of restructuring and integration costs, impairments, and contingent liabilities may vary with evolving conditions.

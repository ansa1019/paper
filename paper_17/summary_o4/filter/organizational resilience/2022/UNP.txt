In response to significant network congestion and unplanned fluctuations in customer demand, the company continued to work to improve its transportation plan, add capacity, enhance operations at yards and other facilities, and address surges in demand with adequate resources, acknowledging that such measures may not fully mitigate service shortcomings; it aggressively hired and graduated 1,302 new train, engine, and yard employees, temporarily relocated personnel to areas of greatest need, added locomotives to the fleet in select locations, and reduced freight car inventory relative to carloads to preserve service continuity. The company maintained a comprehensive safety management system, including its total safety culture, courage to care, commit, and peer-to-peer programs, hazard identification and risk assessments, training, root cause analysis, and targeted capital investments; refined safety procedures and policies based on CDC guidelines; and continued to refine proprietary software and an operating practices command center to enable proactive intervention and derailment prevention. It relies on information technology across all aspects of its business, including positive train control and transportation control systems, and devotes significant resources to cybersecurity risk mitigation, yet recognizes the evolving sophistication of cyber-attacks and the need for ongoing preventive measures. To maintain financial resilience, the company continually evaluates its financial condition and liquidity through a wide range of economic scenarios, maintains committed revolving credit and receivables facilities, generates strong free cash flow, and manages its capital plan—targeted to harden infrastructure, modernize assets, and improve operational efficiency—to ensure sufficient borrowing capacity and resource deployment under varying market conditions. The company has released a climate action plan aligned with its serve-grow-win-together strategy to reduce environmental impact through renewable fuels, alternative fuel technologies, and fuel-efficiency initiatives, and adapts its operations to severe weather, hazardous material transport risks, labor availability constraints under collective bargaining agreements, and public health crises such as COVID-19 by refining safety policies, modifying operational procedures, and reconfiguring resources to preserve or improve performance in the face of adversity and support its strategic objectives.

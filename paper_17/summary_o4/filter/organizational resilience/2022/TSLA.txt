We continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the ongoing readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and government cooperation, while the contingencies inherent in the ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges. If we cannot maintain operations at a scope commensurate with prevailing global market conditions or are required again to suspend operations, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. We may experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products and features, or be unable to control our manufacturing costs, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale new or unique manufacturing processes and design features. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains, achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned, and hire, train and compensate skilled employees to operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges may arise during our production ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. We have used alternative parts and programmed software to mitigate certain challenges caused by component shortages, but if our suppliers do not accurately forecast and effectively allocate production or remain solvent and operational, the unavailability of any component or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to important technology, and may require us to search for new suppliers. As the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will also need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport components at high volumes to our manufacturing facilities and servicing locations internationally, and streamline delivery logistics—including new delivery models such as deliveries to customers’ homes and touchless deliveries—supported by significant cash investments and management resources. Our ability to increase production on a sustained basis, make our products affordable globally by accessing local supply chains and workforces, and expand our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging networks depends on the construction and ramp of our current and future factories, the development and manufacture of proprietary battery cells, the availability and pricing of raw materials and the hiring and retention of qualified personnel, each of which is subject to uncertainties and may limit our capacity to fulfill customer obligations. We face external pressures from competitive, cyclical and volatile automotive and energy markets, changing government regulations and incentives, currency exchange rate fluctuations, cybersecurity threats, union activities, potential product recalls, and evolving environmental, health and safety laws, all of which could disrupt our operations, impede our ability to preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions and materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.

Lowe’s annual report emphasizes the importance of adapting its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment—responding to changing shopping habits, customer demographics, and sustainability expectations—by implementing localized merchandise assortments, maintaining safe store environments, managing shrink, and executing targeted capital investments to preserve or improve functioning under external pressures. The company discloses that its strategic initiatives—such as enhancing omnichannel sales and marketing capabilities, transforming its supply chain network through a market-based delivery model, modernizing technology systems, launching pro loyalty programs, and pursuing productivity improvements via integrated planning, initiative prioritization, and new competencies—are critical to maintaining business continuity and competitive advantage; failure to deliver required capabilities, adapt workforce skills, or realize investment benefits could materially impair firm performance. Lowe’s further identifies risks to organizational resilience from supply chain disruptions caused by pandemics, trade policy changes, extreme weather events, labor disputes, and vendor or service provider failures that could delay inventory flow, increase costs, or lead to out-of-stock positions, thus affecting customer confidence and operational performance. The report also details cybersecurity and IT transformation risks—where system interruptions, security breaches, or inadequate disaster recovery plans could undermine the omnichannel customer experience and data integrity—and notes self-insurance and excess insurance arrangements as mechanisms for mitigating liabilities from workers’ compensation, liability claims, and other hazards. Climate-related physical and transition risks, including natural disasters, rising sea levels, and regulatory changes affecting energy and greenhouse gas emissions, are acknowledged as potential sources of cost increases and operational disruptions. Liquidity and capital resource disclosures highlight the company’s reliance on operating cash flows, revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and debt issuances—supported by credit ratings and covenant compliance—to fund ongoing operations, strategic transformations, and shareholder returns, thereby reinforcing its capacity to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions.

The risk factors section acknowledges that “the COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations,” reflecting the requirement for the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The report further warns that “significant disruptions or production failures at our Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks manufacturing facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials,” underscoring the need for business continuity and operational flexibility. It describes the risk that a “breakdown of our information technology systems, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems… interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation,” prompting the company to state that “we continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems.” The rapid reallocation of resources under the U.S. Defense Production Act and pandemic-related shutdowns and remote-working arrangements illustrate external pressures demanding swift reconfiguring of operations and adaptive capacity. The company also notes that reliance on third-party suppliers for raw materials and components, concentration of sales through a few wholesalers, consolidation of payers, and potential natural disasters or climate change impacts could disrupt supply and distribution, highlighting the importance of risk mitigation, recovery planning, strategic resilience and continuous adjustment under internal or external disturbances.

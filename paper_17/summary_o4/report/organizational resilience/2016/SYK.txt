Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, and we continually evaluate these factors through formal risk assessment and business continuity planning.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted timely, and we are subject to ongoing inspections by the FDA and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with quality system and medical device reporting regulations, with potential sanctions ranging from fines to product seizures and suspension of manufacturing if we fail to comply.  We rely extensively on information technology systems and external networks to conduct business and, despite investments in monitoring, employee training and security policies, evolving cybersecurity threats and potential catastrophic events or security breaches could jeopardize the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and test our business continuity plans.  The successful implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system is critical to processing orders, shipping products, providing services and customer support, invoicing and tracking payments, and any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in design or execution could adversely affect our operations.  Interruption of manufacturing operations, whether due to equipment malfunction, quality‐system compliance issues or other factors, could compromise the availability of products, and in the event of a disruption we may be unable to move quickly to alternate production methods or obtain requisite regulatory approvals, resulting in delays or reputational harm.  Our reliance on a variety of raw materials and components, including sole‐source suppliers, exposes us to potential shortages or price increases that may require significant capital expenditures or adversely impact our competitive position.  We believe our financial condition remains strong, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations to fund ongoing requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to maintain access to commercial paper and credit facilities, to issue investment‐grade debt at competitive rates and to manage liquidity through disciplined capital allocation.  In determining our annual tax rate and evaluating deferred tax assets, management exercises judgment regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and future outcomes, and we maintain valuation allowances where realization is uncertain.  Fair‐value estimates for acquired intangible assets and goodwill are based on projected cash flows, discount rates and market assumptions, with annual qualitative and quantitative impairment testing to ensure assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amounts.  We record reserves for legal proceedings, product liability claims and other contingencies based on our best estimate of probable loss and recognize that actual outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, potentially impacting future operating results.

In our risk disclosures, we highlight potential disruptions to business continuity and organizational integrity stemming from manufacturing difficulties or disruptions at owned or contract facilities—whether from quality and compliance issues, natural disasters, mechanical or information-technology failures or shortages of sole-source materials—that could lead to product shortages and lost revenues; the failure, inadequacy or breach of our IT systems and infrastructure, including network interruptions, service failures, security breaches or cyber-attacks, which may impair the confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical confidential information and business data, and for which we have implemented measures designed to prevent, respond to and minimize such risks; our reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements for functions ranging from product development and manufacturing to IT systems and financial processes, wherein third-party performance shortfalls could materially affect our operations; the risks of significant economic downturns that may reduce product utilization, impair access to credit markets, slow customer collections and increase bad debt expense; exposures to fluctuating interest rates and foreign exchange rates across multiple currencies, for which we employ hedging and other risk-management techniques to limit earnings volatility; and our ongoing monitoring of economic, legislative and funding environments, the creditworthiness of customers and suppliers, and the stability of international operations to preserve sufficient liquidity—such as maintaining cash provided by operations, accessing commercial paper markets, planning capital expenditures, distributing regular dividends, and managing the research and development portfolio to ensure that delays or terminations of individual projects do not disrupt overall R&D spending—in order to maintain performance, adapt to evolving conditions and sustain organizational continuity under adverse or challenging circumstances.

The Company’s disclosures describe numerous processes, strategies and capabilities that align with the concept of organizational resilience, from maintaining business continuity under internal and external pressures to adapting operations in response to disruptions. For example, “our commercial aircraft business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards,” and “we must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability.” The narrative further recognizes complex, systemic interdependencies by noting that “if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs,” and that “any service disruption from one of these suppliers … could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments.” Adaptive accounting and loss‐provision practices, such as reach‐forward losses on aircraft programs and reclassifying non‐saleable prototype costs to research and development, illustrate mechanisms for continuously reassessing resource allocation, risk mitigation and future performance trajectories. The text also details cyber‐ and physical‐security risk‐management controls, pension funding flexibility, diversification of financing sources through Boeing Capital, and ongoing cost‐reduction and supplier‐collaboration initiatives, all serving to preserve system integrity and operational flexibility while enabling recovery, transformation and sustained performance under adverse, uncertain or exceptional conditions.

Goldman Sachs has established resiliency plans and facilities designed to maintain operational continuity and preserve functioning despite internal or external variations, recognizing that “despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted” by infrastructure disruptions. The firm maintains a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies, including a global core liquid assets (GCLA) program, diversified asset‐liability management and a contingency funding plan, to pre-fund potential cash and collateral needs under severely stressed market conditions and mitigate refinancing risk by managing collateral eligibility and tenors of secured financings. Liquidity risk management, market risk management and credit risk management are each governed by multilayered frameworks of board oversight, firmwide and divisional committees, and independent control and support functions that employ stress testing, scenario analysis, value-at-risk, counterparty credit reviews, netting and collateral arrangements to absorb strain and adapt to adversity. The firm’s risk governance embraces ongoing system enhancements, redundant processes and controls, training, supervision and model validation to detect and prevent errors, reconfigure processes in response to disruptions, and ensure key resources and information remain available. Business continuity and disaster recovery initiatives, extensive escalation protocols, regularly updated underwriting standards and technology-risk controls support the ability to reconstitute critical services, reconfigure organizational trajectories and preserve integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

The Company’s risk factors and management’s discussion describe a multifaceted set of strategies, processes and resource allocations designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances.  In particular, the railroad continues to improve its transportation plan, add capacity, enhance operations at yards and other facilities, and maintain surge capability with adequate resources to manage fluctuating demand and weather‐related events; it deploys technology investments – including Positive Train Control, information technology systems, risk assessment tools and targeted capital expenditures – to strengthen its total safety culture, reduce incidents and build operational flexibility; it employs fuel surcharge programs, core pricing gains and productivity initiatives to mitigate volatility in fuel prices, volume fluctuations and economic uncertainty; it aligns workforce levels, training and continuous improvement programs such as “courage to care” and “up way” to engage employees and adjust to changing traffic patterns; it maintains diversified funding through receivables securitization, revolving credit facilities, commercial paper and long‐term debt issuances to ensure liquidity under market turbulence; it monitors and accrues for environmental, personal injury and asbestos liabilities using actuarial analyses; it plans capital investments primarily toward renewing existing capital assets, improving network efficiency and meeting customer demand; and it implements proactive risk management for hazardous materials transport, government regulation, labor negotiations, cyber threats, supplier disruptions, severe weather, climate change, acts of terrorism and other disruptions, all in a systemic effort to maintain network integrity and performance, avoid brittleness, and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

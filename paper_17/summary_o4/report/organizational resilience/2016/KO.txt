The Coca-Cola Company describes organizational resilience in practice through its water risk management program, which applies a water stewardship strategic framework—comprising water use efficiency, wastewater treatment, shared watershed protection, community engagement and sustainable agriculture—to mitigate scarcity and quality constraints; through significant investments in personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and a formal information risk management program, overseen by senior management and the audit committee, to ensure business continuity and operational flexibility in the face of system shutdowns, security breaches, service disruptions or network failures; and through risk assessment processes and crisis response plans designed to address external pressures such as climate change, extreme weather, political instability, natural disasters, cyber-strikes and armed conflicts so as to preserve manufacturing, distribution and supply chain integrity. The company further demonstrates resilience by refranchising bottling operations, pursuing a comprehensive productivity and reinvestment program focused on global supply chain optimization, marketing and innovation effectiveness, expense leverage, operational excellence and digital transformation to enhance resource allocation and dynamic capabilities; by adapting to evolving consumer preferences and maintaining rigorous product safety, quality, legal and human rights standards; and by applying strategic foresight, risk mitigation mechanisms and resource reallocation to absorb strain and emerge stronger under challenging conditions.

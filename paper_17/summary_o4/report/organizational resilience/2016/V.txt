Visaâ€™s risk management and operational framework incorporates a business continuity program intended to recover critical business functions, assets and data in the event of damage or disruption from power outages, system failures, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and other extraordinary events. We regularly evaluate cash requirements for operations, capital investments and litigation contingencies, guided by treasury policies that aim to provide adequate liquidity, support contingency scenarios, ensure timely settlement of payments and fund strategic initiatives, complemented by a commercial paper program, a revolving credit facility and an investment portfolio designed to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Global credit settlement risk is managed through collateral requirements, and we indemnify financial institution clients for settlement losses to mitigate counterparty risk. Our compliance programs and policies are continually enhanced to reflect evolving laws and regulations, while significant resources are devoted to our information security program, which includes security measures and procedures to protect sensitive data and counter cyber-attacks, though there is no assurance against all known or unknown threats. In the face of rapid technological change and intense competition, including disintermediation risks from mobile payments and alternate payment networks, we adapt our products, pricing, rules and services to maintain network attractiveness and competitive advantage, and offer incentives to clients to drive program adoption, volume growth and acceptance. We depend on complex relationships with financial institutions, merchants and third parties, and our brand value and reputation are critical assets in sustaining stakeholder trust and operational flexibility under varied economic, regulatory and market conditions. We systematically assess and record liabilities for legal and regulatory proceedings when losses are deemed probable and estimable, and we monitor pension funding, tax exposures and other contingent obligations to preserve firm performance, system integrity and resource availability under adverse scenarios.

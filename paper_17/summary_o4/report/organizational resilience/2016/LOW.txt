We have developed a comprehensive risk management framework, administered by our chief financial officer, that employs periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks and to develop risk mitigation controls and procedures to support business continuity under challenging conditions. We recognize that adapting our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment—through strategic initiatives such as omni-channel sales and marketing, major technology investments, integrated planning, prioritization and program sequencing—requires new competencies, talent succession, change management and operational flexibility to absorb strain, preserve functioning and maintain organizational health. Our disclosures emphasize the need to protect sensitive customer, employee, vendor and company information, to invest in and maintain resilient customer-facing technology systems with disaster recovery plans to guard against cyber-attacks, outages or other disruptions, and to ensure continuity of payment processing, fulfillment, merchandise ordering and other mission-critical processes. We acknowledge that failure to attract, train, manage and retain a diverse, skilled workforce, to integrate acquisitions and third-party service providers effectively, or to comply with evolving international, federal and state regulations can impair our ability to reconfigure resources, respond to external pressures, sustain competitive advantage and emerge stronger from disruptive events. We further disclose that supply chain interruptions—from trade policy changes, natural disasters, labor unrest, political instability or pandemics—along with litigation, regulatory inquiries, volatility in economic conditions and self-insured exposures such as workers’ compensation, product liability and health claims, all pose potential constraints on our operational resilience and may require additional resource allocation, process innovation and crisis response strategies to maintain performance and support long-term organizational resilience.

The company discloses a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework that integrates board-approved risk appetite statements, executive‐level and functional risk committees, and early warning indicators to identify, assess, measure, monitor and mitigate operational, credit, market, liquidity and compliance risks; this framework includes business continuity and disaster‐recovery plans supported by backup and recovery infrastructure, geographically dispersed facilities, routine testing, access to Federal Reserve discount‐window borrowing and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and multiple external financing sources to maintain operational continuity under internal or external disturbances. Schwab conducts regular liquidity stress tests—including projections of net cash outflows subject to the modified liquidity coverage ratio—and capital stress tests encompassing regulatory capital scenarios, net interest revenue simulation under ±100-basis-point rate shocks, and contingency funding and capital contingency plans approved by the asset-liability management and pricing committee. An information security program, incorporating advanced monitoring tools, strict data‐protection standards, employee access controls, periodic training and coordination with government and industry partners, the model risk governance framework, compliance policies addressing business conduct and regulatory requirements, and credit risk controls such as collateral requirements, credit limits, collateral monitoring and concentration limits further reinforce the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity. Schwab Bank maintains well-capitalized status under Basel III, Dodd-Frank and U.S. banking regulations, including recovery planning guidance for institutions over $50 billion in assets and compliance with net stable funding ratio and liquidity coverage ratio requirements. Its broker-dealer subsidiaries comply with the SEC’s uniform net capital rule and client asset segregation requirements to safeguard market integrity. Together with ongoing investments in people, technology and operational enhancements, diversified funding sources, and prudent dividend and capital planning, these measures collectively enable positive adjustment under challenging conditions and support organizational resilience, system integrity and performance maintenance amid unexpected environmental perturbations.

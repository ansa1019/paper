We will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands and deploy new technologies, and we are actively seeking to make additional investments in spectrum, including sharing or leasing arrangements, to sustain our network capacity and competitive position. If we cannot acquire needed spectrum on a timely basis, or if competitors acquire spectrum that enables superior services, or if we cannot deploy advanced technologies such as 5G without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost and while maintaining network quality, then our ability to attract and retain customers and our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. We recognize that significant technological changes require us to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, enhance existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address changing customer demands, and that failure to do so in an accurate or timely manner could cause material adverse effects on our business, operations, financial condition and operating results. We acknowledge that data loss or other security breaches or cyber-attacks could disrupt internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services, damage our reputation and have other adverse effects, and accordingly we regularly review our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and defend against evolving threats, continually evaluating and adapting our systems and processes to preserve business continuity. We rely on both our systems and networks and those of third-party providers and suppliers for network support, billing and customer service, and warn that system failures, human errors, natural disasters or supplier disruptions could materially impair our ability to provide reliable service, cause customer losses and financial harm, and require substantial remediation costs. We are implementing a new billing system alongside our legacy platform and note that any unanticipated difficulties, disruptions or delays could have adverse operational, financial and reputational effects. We depend heavily on suppliers, subcontractors and third parties to efficiently operate our business, and disruptions or performance failures by these parties could have material adverse effects on our operations and financial performance. Our financing strategy, which leverages cash flows from operations, long-term debt issuances, receivables securitization and credit facilities, illustrates our approach to securing resources for spectrum acquisitions, network build-out and capital expenditures, although restrictive covenants may limit our ability to react to changes in our operating environment or the economy. Finally, through our “un-carrier” strategy and related initiatives—such as simplifying rate plans, offering unlimited high-speed data and incorporating billing and tax into advertised charges—we have deployed adaptive strategies to simplify customer experience, foster loyalty and sustain growth, reflecting our broader commitment to organizational resilience by maintaining positive adjustment under challenging and evolving market conditions.

The Companyâ€™s off-price business model relies on opportunistic buying with lean inventory levels and frequent turns that require merchants to react to rapidly changing market opportunities and trends, assess merchandise desirability and value, and determine how, what and when to source inventory in the face of pricing, quantity, mix, timing and supply chain risks. Its inventory management strategy, which seeks to distribute the right product in the right quantities to the right stores at the right time, supports business continuity by allocating and delivering merchandise to meet customer demand, manage pricing and markdowns and preserve sales and margins, while forecasting processes project sales and align expenses to adjust costs in response to deviations between forecasts and actual results. Growth initiatives, including expansion into new markets, product lines and channels, demand effective management of size and scale, internal resources and third-party providers, consistent information sharing across autonomous banners and agility to expand or contract merchandise categories in response to consumer preference changes. The Company maintains extensive information systems and back-up capabilities, updates and replaces hardware, software and infrastructure, implements disaster recovery plans and hedges inventory- and currency-related exposures to mitigate disruptions from security breaches, system failures, environmental events, external disturbances, transactional foreign exchange variability and logistic constraints, thereby aiming to preserve or enhance operational efficiency under challenging conditions. Strong cash flow generation and forecasting, targeted capital reinvestment in stores, distribution centers, offices and systems, stock repurchase and dividend programs and management of pension, lease and contractual obligations provide financial and resource flexibility to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and sustain performance during adverse or volatile economic, regulatory or competitive environments.

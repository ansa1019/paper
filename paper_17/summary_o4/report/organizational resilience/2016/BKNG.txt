The text describes how our organization confronts a wide range of internal and external pressures by adopting measures intended to preserve its integrity and functioning under challenging conditions. It acknowledges that “other unforeseen events beyond our control, such as worldwide recession, oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual or extreme weather or natural disasters … travel-related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics … political instability, regional hostilities, imposition of taxes or surcharges … can disrupt travel or otherwise result in declines in travel demand,” and that “because these events or concerns are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers, and therefore demand for our services, which can adversely affect our business and results of operations.” In response, we maintain redundant systems and hosting services, though “it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business” and our business interruption insurance “would likely not be adequate to reimburse us for all losses that may occur.” We have experienced “denial-of-service” attacks, phishing attacks and system failures that “could cause significant interruptions in our operations and potentially adversely affect our brand, operations and results of operations,” and we continue to invest in security measures and system capacity to mitigate these risks. We rely on both internally developed systems and third-party services, including global distribution and reservation systems, and we recognize that any “interruption in these third-party services and systems or deterioration in their performance could prevent us from booking related … reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business, brands and results of operations.” To ensure operational flexibility, we invest in marketing, technology and personnel “within parameters consistent with attempts to improve long-term operating results,” monitor changes in “internet search engine algorithms” and mobile adoption, and engage in continuous “brand advertising” and “performance advertising” to maintain traffic and consumer confidence, fully aware that “changes by Google in how it presents travel search results … may be competitively disadvantageous to us.” We acknowledge the critical role of our workforce, noting that if we “are unable to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel, which may limit our growth, damage our reputation, negatively affect our financial performance, and otherwise harm our business,” our resilience would be impaired. Finally, we face complex regulatory and tax landscapes in multiple jurisdictions, where compliance demands and evolving rules must be managed to sustain adaptability, maintain business continuity and uphold our organizational health under both nominal and extreme conditions.

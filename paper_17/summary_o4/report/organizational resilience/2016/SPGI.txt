The company discloses that its ability to withstand and recover from adverse events depends on robust business continuity and disaster-recovery planning, noting that should it experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem—such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disruption—it could suffer operational challenges if key personnel, facilities or critical computer, telecommunications or related systems become unavailable, potentially resulting in material financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm, legal liability, loss of human capital or damaged client relationships. The company regularly assesses and seeks to improve its existing business continuity plans and key management succession but acknowledges that a disaster on a significant scale or failure to recover successfully could materially interrupt operations. It further recognizes that outsourcing certain support functions to third-party service providers to leverage specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies carries inherent risks—these providers may fail to meet contractual, regulatory or confidentiality obligations or maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards, any of which could lead to unreliable results, unauthorized system access, network or data disruptions, improper disclosures, regulatory penalties, remedial costs or material financial loss. The firm’s predominantly electronic delivery model and reliance on network systems and the internet expose it to infrastructure or network failures from malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or regulatory changes, which may harm its ability to process transactions, deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks or store, handle and secure customer data; although disaster recovery plans include backup facilities for primary data centers, systems are not always fully redundant and these plans may not be sufficient or effective. In addition, the company highlights rapidly evolving cyber threats—ranging from denial-of-service attacks and sophisticated intrusions to dormant malware—that could defeat preventive measures, compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of material information, damage its brand and reputation, impair customer confidence, result in litigation or regulatory actions and impose substantial incident response expenses. Finally, the company notes that exposure to litigation and government or regulatory enforcement matters in multiple jurisdictions is inherently uncertain, often difficult to predict in timing and outcome, and may impose additional expenses and management demands that reduce operational flexibility and could materially affect its business, financial condition or results of operations.

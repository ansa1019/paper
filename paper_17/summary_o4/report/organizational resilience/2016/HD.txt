Intense competitive pressures from one or more of our competitors, such as through aggressive promotional pricing or liquidation events, or our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, our margins or demand for our products and services, and if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, our market share and our financial performance could be adversely affected. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share, and customers now routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products, requiring us to continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process through programs like BOSS, BOPIS and direct fulfillment, without guarantee of success. We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data, and although we and our third-party service providers seek to maintain our respective systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromise of the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, such efforts may not be successful, and as a result we or our service providers could experience errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service in key portions of our information technology infrastructure, which could significantly disrupt our operations and be costly, time consuming and resource-intensive to remedy. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences, and if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs and reputational damage, and there is no guarantee that our processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access or use of data will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with a sufficient number of qualified suppliers, or if our suppliers experience financial difficulties or other challenges, our ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail altogether, and disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the distribution of our merchandise could impair our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, meet customer demand for products and result in lost sales, increased supply chain costs or damage to our reputation. In fiscal 2016, we continued to optimize our supply chain through our multi-year program called Project Sync, rolling out the first phase to all of our U.S. stores and onboarding new suppliers, which is designed to significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf, reduce transportation expenses and improve inventory turns. We also continue to blend our physical and digital assets in a seamless and frictionless way to enhance the end-to-end customer experience, as evidenced by our website redesign, mobile app update and deployment of our new COM platform in all U.S. stores.

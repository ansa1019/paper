We acknowledge that “economic, political, regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities,” potentially leading to the loss of critical property or equipment, difficulty in staffing and managing operations, and reductions in volumes, revenues and net earnings. To mitigate such disruptions and preserve operational continuity, “we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access”; nevertheless, “failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us.” We further recognize that we “may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns,” which drives our strategic priorities “to promote brand equity successfully,” “anticipate and respond to new consumer trends,” “develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios,” “improve productivity,” “ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products” and “be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.” Our disclosures under forward-looking statements identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our plans and assumptions, reflecting prudent risk assessment and acknowledging the potential for unanticipated variations to materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

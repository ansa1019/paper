In the event we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer, underscoring the need to make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. Third-party hosting and service relationships amplify exposure as some of our lines of business rely on us or our third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or failures in data collection could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation; moreover, we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated and critical vulnerabilities may be identified in certain of our applications that could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system, resulting in liability or limiting our ability to conduct our business. Catastrophic events may disrupt our business in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans could not adequately address, which could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments, and compliance with complex and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. We often release new offerings and employ new product and service delivery methods in connection with our diversification into new business models and markets, yet it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business as access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is vulnerable to prolonged droughts, and in the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited access to these resources, Adobe has the potential to experience losses to our business, time required to recover, and added costs to resume operations.

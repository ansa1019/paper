The Company’s disclosures underscore its reliance on robust business continuity and risk mitigation processes to preserve functioning under internal or external disturbances, including the implementation of security measures designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss, the maintenance of crisis management and disaster response plans for natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power shortages, pandemics, terrorism and political unrest, and investments in data center capacity, cloud infrastructure and redundancy to support service continuity. It acknowledges that disruptions or defects—whether from computer malware, phishing or denial of service attacks, errors in delivering, configuring or hosting services, third-party software defects, equipment failures or events beyond its control—could interrupt its services, damage customer businesses, trigger indemnification obligations, regulatory inquiries or litigation, and harm its reputation, and that it does not carry insurance sufficient to cover such losses. The Company further notes the potential for lengthy interruptions and data loss at co-located third-party data centers vulnerable to sabotage, vandalism or operator error and emphasizes its ongoing evaluation of significant investments to protect data and infrastructure. It identifies volatility in foreign currency exchange rates as a risk to its consolidated revenues and operating results and contemplates future use of derivative instruments to hedge exposures, noting that such strategies may not fully mitigate adverse financial effects and may introduce additional risks. Additionally, the Company describes operational inflexibility that could arise from its subscription-based revenue recognition model, which recognizes revenue ratably over multi-year contracts and defers incremental selling costs such as commissions, and it highlights its reliance on appropriately staffed internal professional services and an ecosystem of third-party partners to implement and configure its services, the failure of which could impair its ability to respond effectively to market or customer-driven disruptions and constrain revenue growth. In anticipation of technological and competitive pressures, the Company stresses its need to continuously enhance products to deliver intuitive, consumer-like experiences and acknowledges that adverse economic conditions, regulatory changes—including data privacy and sovereignty requirements—and unforeseen operating expenses or delays could challenge its ability to preserve or improve performance under challenging conditions.

Our disclosures emphasize that maintaining “business continuity” and preserving functionality under adverse conditions requires robust disaster-recovery planning, system redundancy and ongoing investments in information-technology infrastructure, privacy and security capabilities, and service innovation to absorb strain and mitigate risks from internal and external disturbances. We acknowledge that our IT and communications systems, many of which reside in single data centers near seismic faults, are vulnerable to natural disasters, cyber-attacks, power loss, human error and third-party service failures, any of which could cause data loss, unplanned service disruptions—particularly during peak periods such as tax season—lost customers, revenue declines and reputational damage. We describe our migration to new data centers and cloud environments, the continuous upgrade of customer-facing applications, and collaboration with industry and government on fraud detection as key adaptive strategies to ensure continuous service availability, manage evolving cybersecurity threats and recover quickly from disruptions. We also highlight the need to allocate resources to product development, marketing and strategic partnerships in the face of rapid technological change, intense competitive pressures and complex regulatory requirements, recognizing that missteps in integrating new business models or in responding to regulatory or market shifts could impair organizational health, necessitate reconfiguration of our operations and erode our brand equity—underscoring the multifaceted nature of resilience as the ability to maintain integrity and performance while adapting to environmental perturbations.

Nee and FPL employ a multifaceted risk-management and capital-planning framework designed to absorb adverse events and preserve service reliability under extreme or unexpected conditions.  This framework includes regulatory rate-making mechanisms and reserve amortization provisions that permit recovery of costs incurred in constructing, replacing or decommissioning generation, transmission and distribution assets; cost-recovery clauses and securitized storm-recovery bond surcharges that automatically pass through fuel, storm recovery, environmental and infrastructure costs; maintenance of storm-recovery and nuclear-decommissioning funds invested in liquid and longer-duration securities to ensure emergency liquidity and fund asset retirement obligations; comprehensive insurance programs, surety bonds and letters of credit to mitigate property, environmental and operational liabilities; extensive derivative hedging and trading policies, supported by value-at-risk limits, collateral requirements and master netting agreements, to stabilize revenues and cash flows against commodity price, interest-rate and currency fluctuations; structured access to bank revolving credit, term loans and capital markets for debt and equity financing to underwrite major capital projects and acquisitions; ongoing system hardening and capacity expansion—including modernized clean-energy centers, solar installations and pipeline investments—to enhance operational flexibility and meet changing customer needs; proactive project risk assessment and contingency planning for licensing, permitting and construction disruptions; governance processes that monitor regulatory, legislative and market developments and track counterparty exposure; and consolidated management oversight that aligns resource deployment, stakeholder engagement and financial tools to maintain organizational resilience defined as the system’s ability to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain performance while adapting to internal or external disturbances.

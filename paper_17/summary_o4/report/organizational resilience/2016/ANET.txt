The Company’s risk disclosures and management discussion highlight its need to maintain continuity and preserve performance under internal and external pressures, noting that rapid growth and increased demand have “placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure” and require ongoing improvements to systems and processes, including “operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems,” to scale effectively. The disclosures identify a spectrum of potential disruptions—sole‐source and limited‐source component shortages, capacity constraints and supply chain delays, quality defects in complex products, reliance on contract manufacturers and logistics providers, cybersecurity breaches, litigation and evolving regulatory requirements, environmental laws, export/import controls and natural disasters—that could materially impair operations, delay shipments and damage customer relationships. To mitigate these risks and adapt to changing conditions, the Company describes efforts to diversify procurement, develop technical design-arounds to address exclusion orders, enhance disaster recovery and business continuity plans, reconfigure manufacturing and shipping workflows, comply with anti-corruption and other regulations, and adjust product designs and supply chain structures, thereby aiming to absorb strain, respond to disruptive events and reconfigure trajectories toward future performance.

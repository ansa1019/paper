The company acknowledges that “additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations” and that an “unfavorable resolution of one or more [legal or regulatory] matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows,” underscoring our need for risk assessment, mitigation and crisis management to sustain performance under pressure. We recognize that “the use of a significant portion of our cash and the incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the proposed transaction may … limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions,” highlighting the importance of liquidity management, financial resilience and strategic resource allocation. Our disclosures describe how “matters relating to the proposed transaction require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team and numerous others throughout our organization” and that “uncertainties about the proposed transaction may impair our … ability to retain, recruit or motivate key … personnel,” reflecting the significance of organizational health, human capital resilience and adaptability. Competitive pressures, including “rapid technological change that could result in decreased demand and/or declining average selling prices” and dependency on a limited number of customers, signal the need for continuous strategic adaptation, dynamic capabilities and operational flexibility. The firm also details its systematic approach to asset management—valuing inventories at the “lower of cost or market” based on “future customer demand” and testing “goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment”—demonstrating structured performance maintenance, resource reconfiguration and recovery under varying market conditions. Our strategic realignment plan, which included targeted reductions in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, and our strategic collaboration with TDK Corporation to form RF360 Holdings for rffe module and filter integration, further illustrate inter-organizational collaboration, resource sharing and transformation designed to strengthen our resilience amid environmental turbulence.

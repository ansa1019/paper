Blackstone’s disclosures emphasize its dependence on robust systems and processes to preserve operations when confronted with severe disruptions, noting that “we rely heavily on our financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems” and that if these “are compromised, do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our investment funds and fund investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.” The firm further acknowledges that “a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption,” and cautions that “our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption.” Blackstone also recognizes the need to “develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain … our culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests with investors,” warning that failure to do so “could impair our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives.” In the face of challenging market and economic conditions, the firm notes its ability to “scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in revenue” and cautions that if its “fund investment performance could suffer, … the payment of less or no carried interest could cause our cash flow from operations to significantly decrease, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity position,” potentially compelling reliance on alternative financing sources to maintain operational continuity.

The Company’s risk disclosures repeatedly emphasize the need to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by securing business continuity and operational flexibility across its supply chain, noting, for example, that under its wafer supply agreement “we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a portion of our GPU product requirements from GF” and warning that “if GF is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted.”  To mitigate this concentration risk and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, the Company entered into a sixth amendment granting “greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio,” negotiated annual wafer purchase targets through 2020 and secured a limited waiver to contract with alternative foundries.  It further highlights strategic inter-organizational collaboration through two ATMP joint ventures with TFME—expecting the majority of its assembly, test, mark and packaging services to be provided by these JVs—and an IP licensing joint venture in China designed to support its expansion into the server and workstation market, all steps intended to reconfigure resources, deploy core competencies and absorb external disturbances.  The Company underscores its dependence on third-party wafer foundries and manufacturing suppliers to “fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products” and to “assemble, test, mark and pack” its products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, cautioning that “if we experience supply constraints… we may be required to allocate the affected products among our customers” or face lost sales, which in turn could compromise firm performance and customer relationships.  Similar considerations arise in its reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners, whose nonexclusive agreements and return rights could introduce variability and require the Company to adapt its resource deployment and risk assessment processes.  The disclosures also recognize risks from external pressures—such as power outages, natural disasters, geopolitical uncertainty and “uncertain global economic conditions” that may cause customers to postpone purchases—underscoring the importance of dynamic capabilities, crisis management and resilience strategies to preserve system integrity and performance under pressure.  Finally, the Company’s 2015 and 2014 restructuring plans, which aimed to “simplify our business and better align resources,” reflect a systemic perspective on organizational change, involving headcount reductions and outsourcing of IT and application development, all intended to enhance adaptability, preserve liquidity and strengthen its ability to maintain operations through extreme or unexpected events.

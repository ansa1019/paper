Mastercard devotes substantial resources to defending its interchange rate‐setting rights through regulatory proceedings, litigation and legislative activity, monitors global economic, political and regulatory developments and adjusts its strategic initiatives and resource allocations accordingly, and maintains an information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage—each reviewed by its board of directors—and periodically tests its systems to discover and address potential vulnerabilities and embed multiple levels of protection within its processing infrastructure to mitigate cyber-threats and service disruptions. The company guarantees certain customer settlement obligations, monitors its customers’ financial condition, their economic and political operating environments and compliance with participation standards, and holds a committed revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to support operational continuity and liquidity in the event of settlement failures. It continuously invests in technology evolution and product innovation across mobile, e-commerce and security standards, anticipates and adapts to rapid and significant technological developments, and works with third parties and internal teams to enhance its risk management processes—thereby preserving system integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. Through its global footprint across more than two hundred countries and over one hundred fifty currencies, and its ability to reconfigure strategies in response to foreign exchange fluctuations, evolving regulatory frameworks, competitive threats and industry consolidation, Mastercard sustains its core operations, recovers from unexpected events and positions itself to maintain positive adjustment and future growth.

In our 10-K, the company discloses that operational failures in its transaction processing businesses, including its business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, pose a risk to client relationships and revenue continuity, underscoring the need to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse events. The firm acknowledges that its ability to adapt products and services to changes in technology and in the marketplace and to enhance information security and controls directly affects its capacity to respond to environmental disturbances and maintain performance. It further notes that prolonged economic downturns, industry consolidations or failures of strategic counterparties may reduce demand and challenge resource reallocation, while evolving regulatory and cybersecurity requirements may slow its ability to adapt, require significant compliance investments and constrain strategic flexibility. The company’s strategic initiatives—including disciplined capital allocation, operational effectiveness programs, investments in digital and payment innovations, active portfolio management of acquisitions, integration of complementary businesses and talent retention efforts—are described as mechanisms to reconfigure resource deployment, reconstitute response trajectories and strengthen infrastructure, technology and human capital to sustain integrity, competitive advantage and performance under evolving pressures. Financial resilience measures such as diversified funding sources, debt covenants under revolving and term credit facilities and senior note covenants are identified as tools to safeguard liquidity and support continuity and transformation during nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

Boston Scientific’s 2016 Annual Report describes a multifaceted resilience framework that emphasizes proactive adaptation to external pressures and the preservation of operational continuity under nominal, extreme or exceptional variations.  It details the adoption of a 2016 restructuring plan “intended to develop global commercialization, technology and manufacturing capabilities in key growth markets, build on our plant network optimization strategy” and other cost and efficiency improvement measures—including “movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures, and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities,” which require “significant investment in time and cost”—to enhance flexibility and resource reconfiguration.  The company also stresses rigorous monitoring of economic, regulatory and market dynamics “to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects, capital and our people,” alongside diversification of its supply chain and credit arrangements—such as accounts receivable factoring programs, a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and maintenance of investment-grade ratings—to ensure business continuity and strength under financial and market disruptions.  Continuous investment in acquiring and integrating advanced technologies and products, coordinated across information technology, R&D, sales, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing and finance functions, aims to absorb strain and maintain product development and launch trajectories despite competitive, regulatory and technological turbulence.  In addition, comprehensive regulatory and IT compliance programs are employed to mitigate risk, protect system integrity and secure organizational performance when facing cyber-attacks or evolving global standards.  Collectively, these initiatives reflect the company’s strategic foresight, resourcefulness, adaptability and commitment to positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

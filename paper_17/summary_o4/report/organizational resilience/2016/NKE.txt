Nike’s 2016 Form 10-K highlights that the company operates in a “very competitive and rapidly changing environment” subject to “business disruptions” (including port congestion, extreme weather, natural disasters and data security breaches), currency fluctuations, shifting consumer demand, regulatory and legal pressures, and supply-chain risks that could impair performance and require rapid reconfiguration of operations. To preserve or improve functioning under these internal and external variations, Nike employs a comprehensive risk-management framework that includes a foreign exchange risk management program with hedges and embedded derivatives to offset gains and losses on non-functional-currency transactions, a futures-ordering program designed to “minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory … and the risk of non-delivery,” diversified third-party footwear and apparel contract manufacturing across 15 countries, committed credit facilities and business interruption insurance, and an extensive direct-to-consumer network (in-line and e-commerce) alongside traditional wholesale channels to sustain cash flows and maintain customer access during disruptions. The company continually invests in information systems for demand-and-supply planning, digital capabilities, infrastructure and operational excellence, applies working-capital efficiency and strategic resource deployment (including targeted investments in emerging markets and product innovation), enforces controls to detect and prevent errors or unauthorized disclosures, and maintains contingency plans for retail, distribution and IT continuity. These measures, together with ongoing assessments of inventory obsolescence, credit risk allowances, legal and regulatory contingencies, and scenario-planning tools, illustrate Nike’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to environmental perturbations and recover performance—reflecting a systemic approach to positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

The Company’s risk factors acknowledge that internal or external variations and disturbances—ranging from natural or man-made disasters and acts of sabotage to cybersecurity breaches, critical information technology failures and economic disruptions such as currency fluctuations and geopolitical events—could impair operations, supply chain continuity, product development cycles and financial condition. The firm’s maintained liquidity positions, including cash reserves, marketable securities, revolving credit facilities and robust operating cash flow, underpin its ability to reconstitute resource deployment and preserve strategic initiatives under stress. Through an evolution of its operating model—focusing investment on prioritized therapeutic areas, streamlining manufacturing networks, accelerating asset rationalization and maintaining lean administrative functions—the Company has sought to enhance operational flexibility, facilitate rapid reconfiguration of organizational processes and sustain performance under pressure. Contractual provisions in alliance agreements require third parties to deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis, reinforcing collaborative risk mitigation and preserving system integrity. Ongoing investments in information technology protections, monitoring practices and contingency measures further support system resilience and recovery from disruptions. Proactive restructuring actions, including accelerated depreciation, facility exits and impairment recognition, demonstrate the organization’s adaptive strategies for maintaining integrity and performance. Finally, disciplined capital-allocation practices, compliance with inventory management policies under the SEC consent order and diversified contractual obligations contribute to the maintenance of continuity and integrity of operations despite unexpected challenges.

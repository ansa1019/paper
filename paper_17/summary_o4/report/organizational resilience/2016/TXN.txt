The Company discloses that it faces substantial competition requiring it to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures and to make significant investments in research and development before commercial viability can be assured, supported by a strong foundation of manufacturing technology and low-cost in-house production that ensures a consistent supply of products, enables increases in factory loadings (for example, a 15 percent uplift on 300-millimeter wafers) and underpins its broad analog and embedded processing portfolio, which serves highly diverse and long-lived markets and allows for resource reallocation toward innovation. It matches inventory and production with forecasted customer demand to support operational flexibility and business continuity, operates globally across more than 30 countries and manages exposures to macroeconomic downturns, political, social, economic and security risks, currency fluctuations, protectionism, natural disasters, health epidemics and information technology system breaches that could disrupt manufacturing, supply chains, transportation and communications. The Company relies on third-party suppliers subject to quality excursions, disputes, natural events, credit market instability and limited access to raw materials, natural resources and utilities, and is subject to complex domestic and international laws, rules and regulations—including environmental, safety, health, export, import, bribery, data privacy, tax, labor, competition and conflict minerals requirements—that may impose onerous compliance costs or restrict its ability to manufacture and ship products. To mitigate these risks and preserve functioning under internal and external disturbances, it maintains diversified liquidity sources, including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility, and generated free cash flow of $4.08 billion in 2016, which funds working capital, capital expenditures (primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment), dividends and debt obligations. The Company also undertakes strategic acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions to reconfigure resources and support its objectives, enforces and protects its intellectual property rights, monitors warranty and product liability claims and evaluates deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions, demonstrating its capacity to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain performance under a wide range of pressures.

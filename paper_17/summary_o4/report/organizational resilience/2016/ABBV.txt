AbbVie’s risk disclosures highlight several organizational resilience mechanisms: it relies on patent, trademark and intellectual property protection and vigorously defends its rights through litigation to preserve competitive advantage; it maintains business interruption insurance to protect against single‐source supplier failures and invests in robust manufacturing processes—designed, validated and monitored by sophisticated quality assurance programs—to absorb disruptions such as equipment malfunctions, natural disasters or regulatory shutdowns; it manages credit and foreign‐exchange risks by monitoring customer creditworthiness, establishing allowances, utilizing hedging instruments and maintaining a $3 billion revolving credit facility to ensure liquidity and operational flexibility across international markets; it dedicates substantial resources to research and development and strategic alliances—entering milestone‐based collaboration and acquisition agreements—to reconfigure its portfolio toward growth areas and sustain performance under adversity; it enforces rigorous compliance programs and training, including a corporate integrity agreement, to navigate complex and evolving regulatory environments globally; and it secures data privacy and system integrity through ongoing IT investments and monitoring to guard against cyber threats, all of which support the maintenance of performance and continuity under challenging conditions.

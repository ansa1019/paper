We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins, and barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low as we compete in rapidly evolving areas subject to disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers, and in support of this we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation, while the companyâ€™s increasing reliance on data-driven insights is becoming more important to the success of key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies, maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on a growing array of computing devices, ensuring our services meet customer reliability expectations and maintain data security, and making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic across a wide range of ecosystems. We recognize that if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services and protect customer data, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. To defend against security threats we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve software-update deployment, develop mitigation technologies that protect customers even when updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increasing traffic on our websites and in our datacenters; maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex and requires a robust, reliable Internet-connectivity infrastructure that adapts to evolving competitive and regulatory constraints. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience, resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and third parties, reputational damage, and loss of users or subscribers, any of which may harm our operating results and financial condition. Providing more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and the strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the impact of prolonged service outages on our results. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could delay sales, service delivery, or other critical functions. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key personnel could hinder our strategic planning and execution. As our international operations grow, emerging markets present risks including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, all of which require ongoing risk assessment, contingency planning, and resource reconfiguration to preserve organizational health and sustain performance under pressure.

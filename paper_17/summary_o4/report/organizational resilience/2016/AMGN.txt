Among the many risks described, the Company acknowledges that “our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations,” and warns that “legislative or regulatory changes or other government initiatives that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates, limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients or limit the pricing of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.” It further notes that payers may “choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely,” and that “ultimately, further discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.” On the compliance front, the Company warns that “if our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations,” and that “as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.” The report highlights competitive pressures from generics and biosimilars, stating that “we currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future” and that “expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could accelerate such competition.” Manufacturing is identified as a critical vulnerability: “manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated,” such that “if the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products.” The Company discloses reliance on third-party suppliers, noting that “we rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products,” and warns of risks from “natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires,” supplier insolvency, regulatory actions or shortages. It further points out that “we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; if significant disruptions or production failures occur at [either facility], we may not be able to supply these products or, at [the Thousand Oaks facility], we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.” To address cost and operational flexibility, the Company reports that “transformation and process improvement initiatives” are underway “to reallocate resources to fund many of our innovative pipeline and growth opportunities,” with estimated charges of $800 million to $900 million under its restructuring plan and savings of $1.2 billion realized since 2014. Liquidity management is emphasized, with the Company stating that “existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements,” while acknowledging that “the capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption … we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all.” The report also underscores legal and regulatory contingency planning, warning that “civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties … and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business,” and noting dependence on information systems for continuity: “we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure, network connected control systems and data security,” and recognizing that “these systems are targets of service interruption, destruction, malicious intrusion and attack” and that “there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or detect all breaches.” These disclosures reflect the Company’s attention to risk assessment, crisis management, transformation, resource reallocation, operational flexibility and continuity planning to preserve performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

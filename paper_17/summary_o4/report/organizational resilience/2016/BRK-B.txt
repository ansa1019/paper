The disclosures indicate that Berkshire’s board “continually monitors” and has “identified certain current Berkshire subsidiary managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr. Buffett,” reflecting a formal succession plan designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under the loss of key personnel; the company “relies on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business” and has implemented “business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis” to mitigate operational interruptions from cyber intrusions or other internal or external variations; its “unusually decentralized business model,” with “essentially no centralized or integrated business functions” and “minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters,” enables operating units to deploy local knowledge, allocate resources and maintain flexibility in responding to customer needs, competitive pressures and technological change; management “strives for long‐term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages” while acknowledging that “competition and technology may erode our business franchises” and that future results depend on “whether our operating units are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages”; the firm recognizes that “deterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost” and that “restrictions” on “access to borrowed funds” could adversely affect its utilities, energy and railroad operations, which “require significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain” network integrity and ensure “safe and reliable” service; and it notes that “regulatory initiatives,” “terrorist acts,” volatile markets and legal or accounting changes may introduce “unanticipated” losses or “significant volatility” in earnings, underscoring the need for adaptive strategies, resource reconfiguration and sustained operational continuity to maintain performance under challenging conditions.

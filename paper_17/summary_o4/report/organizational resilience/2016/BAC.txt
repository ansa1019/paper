The report discloses that business continuity and contingency planning are integral to sustaining operations, noting that capital contingency, liquidity contingency plans and recovery and resolution planning focus on maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and ensure operating subsidiaries continue functioning or wind down solvently. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa, at times limiting hedging strategy effectiveness, exacerbating losses and challenging our ability to de-risk positions. Our reliance on operational and security systems, including computer systems, data management and backup infrastructures, is essential to our performance, and we have implemented safeguards, including backup systems and cybersecurity controls, to support operations and mitigate risks from cyberattacks, technology failures or major physical outages. The managementâ€™s discussion addresses systemic resilience through diversification of funding sources, centralized asset and liability management and intercompany arrangements that allocate capital and liquidity between the parent holding company and key operating subsidiaries to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. Enterprise-wide stress testing, which assesses balance sheet, earnings and liquidity sensitivities under baseline and adverse scenarios, along with contingency funding plans, establish escalation procedures and potential actions such as asset sales, capital issuances and de-risking strategies to confront liquidity disruptions. The risk framework and culture of managing risk well across front-line units, independent risk management and corporate audit provide governance and monitoring of strategic, market, credit, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks, with model validation, key risk indicators and regular scenario analyses to foresee, adapt to and benefit from sudden disruptive change in order to maintain integrity and performance.

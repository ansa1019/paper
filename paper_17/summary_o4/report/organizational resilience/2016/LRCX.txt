The company’s disclosures emphasize its ongoing efforts to absorb and respond to significant variability and external pressures in the cyclic semiconductor capital equipment industry by dynamically adjusting spending and resource allocations, continually reassessing strategic resource allocation choices, and employing cost‐management programs to align expenditures with anticipated revenue streams. It acknowledges that periods of rapid growth or decline in customer demand present challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, workforce training, and appropriately sizing its supply chain infrastructure to ensure operational continuity under extreme or exceptional conditions. To maintain system integrity and performance under internal or external variations, the firm maintains liquidity reserves, pursues diversified debt and equity financings, and hedges foreign currency exposures to support sustained investments in research and development, capital infrastructure, and working capital despite unpredictable global economic and trade conditions. The company also implements ISO 27001–compliant cybersecurity measures, secures alternative supplier sources where feasible, carries insurance against business interruptions, and structures its operations and contractual commitments—including deferred revenue management and backlog controls—to preserve business continuity in the face of procurement shortages, supplier nonperformance, manufacturing difficulties, customer cancellations, natural or man-made disasters, and regulatory or geopolitical disruptions. These measures collectively reflect the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, in line with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

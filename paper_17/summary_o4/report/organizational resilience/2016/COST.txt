We highlight our history of adapting our business to external economic and competitive pressures—“such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items”—in order to maintain sales growth and leverage operating expenses. We note that fluctuations in currency exchange rates and gasoline prices can significantly impact net sales and gross margin percentages, and we employ foreign‐exchange forward contracts and mark‐to‐market adjustments to mitigate these risks. We secure predictable fee revenue and reinforce member loyalty through a membership‐fee model with high renewal rates and executive member upgrades. We continue to invest in the modernization of our information systems—despite near‐term increases in depreciation and service‐contract costs—to enhance our operational flexibility and long‐term performance. We extend our warehouse base through new openings and relocations, acknowledging lower initial operating profitability and cannibalization effects, yet sustaining growth and mitigating site‐selection constraints over time. Our cost‐control philosophy balances competitive employee compensation to reduce turnover and improve satisfaction with the need to manage health care and utility expenses, recognizing that modest changes in merchandise costs and SG&A expenses can materially affect net income. Liquidity is preserved via cash flows from operations, cash and short‐term investments, access to bank credit facilities, commercial paper programs and standby letters of credit, while capital expenditure plans for land, buildings and equipment are funded through internal resources. We also manage the repatriation of non‐U.S. earnings to optimize tax outcomes without impairing our reinvestment strategy. Together, these strategic initiatives and resource allocations demonstrate our ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning, and adapt to diverse internal and external variations, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

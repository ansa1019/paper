Starbucks maintains comprehensive incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans and operational safeguards designed to preserve system performance and product availability in the face of IT failures or cyber-attacks, supported by significant ongoing investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to anticipate, prevent and minimize security breaches. To manage upstream risks and safeguard product supply, the company employs a mix of fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed coffee purchase contracts together with financial derivatives under a formal market price risk management policy, enforces quantitative risk limits, and continually scales its supply-chain infrastructure and vendor qualification processes to ensure timely, high-quality sourcing despite external disruptions. Liquidity resilience is achieved through active management of cash and investments, a revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program and targeted long-term debt issuances, all structured to support working capital needs, capital expenditures, strategic growth initiatives, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend payments. Moreover, disciplined global expansion, adaptive store-format strategies, product and channel innovation, and increased partner and digital platform investments demonstrate the companyâ€™s capacity to absorb economic pressures, maintain brand integrity and preserve or enhance operational and financial performance under challenging conditions.

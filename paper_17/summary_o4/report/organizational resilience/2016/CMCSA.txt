Our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments, facing external pressures from technological changes and audience fragmentation that challenge existing business models and require continuous adaptation and service innovation. In our cable communications segment, for example, we are deploying our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways, growing high-speed internet, business services and home security offerings, and investing in scalable infrastructure and line extensions to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions, although there can be no assurance that we can execute on these initiatives in a manner sufficient to grow or maintain segment revenue or operating margin. We rely on network and information systems and a comprehensive security program to manage risks from cyber attacks, process breakdowns, natural disasters and other hazards, recognizing that any degradation or disruption of critical systems could impair business continuity and require significant expenditures to restore operations. We also depend on third-party vendors for essential hardware, software and support, and our failure to identify or mitigate vendor risks could adversely affect our ability to provide services. In our NBCUniversal segments we invest substantial funds in content creation, programming rights and theme-park development before knowing consumer acceptance, manage escalating costs for sports and popular programming, enforce intellectual property rights against piracy, and confront regulatory, labor and market risks that may constrain resource allocation, operational flexibility and strategic foresight. Our global operations expose us to economic volatility, currency fluctuations, shifting regulations and geopolitical risks that may impede adaptation and recovery. We support resilience through disciplined capital investment, diversified revenue streams, cash flows from operations, committed credit facilities and proactive covenant management, yet we acknowledge that ongoing competition, regulatory changes, economic downturns, labor disputes, technological shifts and other adverse events may test our capacity to absorb strain, preserve system integrity and emerge stronger from disruptions.

Nvidia’s disclosures emphasize that its success “depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets,” which “may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments,” and that the company “devote[s] significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings” and “must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and support.” It further acknowledges that “for portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties” and “we also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner.” The risk factors warn that “system security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses,” and that “to defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features.” They also note that “a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions,” and that “catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel,” underscoring the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources, maintaining connectivity and information security, and tailoring infrastructure and processes in response to evolving business needs and environmental uncertainties.

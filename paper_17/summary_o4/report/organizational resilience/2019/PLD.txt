Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks; despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as computer viruses or unauthorized access, any of which could cause interruptions in our operations, result in a material disruption to our business, incur additional costs to remedy damages and impair our security measures, potentially leading to violations of privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information, significant legal and financial exposure, reputational harm and loss of confidence in our security. We also face the risk that deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations, which could undermine the reliability of information used to support business decisions. In addition, as a global company conducting a significant portion of our business outside the U.S., we encounter challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in diverse geographies and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws, underscoring the importance of coordinated process governance and the deployment of technology‚Äêenabled solutions across our asset and operational network.

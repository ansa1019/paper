AbbVie depends on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business, and a failure of those systems—whether caused by malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown—could materially and adversely affect its critical business operations. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may result in the failure of key processes or expose sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in its information technology systems, which could lead to loss of revenue, loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVie’s or third-party providers’ databases or IT systems, and potentially substantial legal, financial, reputational or business harm and remediation costs. Moreover, changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations could adversely affect AbbVie’s operations.

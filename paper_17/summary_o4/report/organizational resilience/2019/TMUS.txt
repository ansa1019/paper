The Company’s 10-K disclosures emphasize its heavy reliance on information technology systems, manual and automated processes, network components and software development services, and a new third-party-supported billing platform as critical to its ability to operate, transact, manage internal controls and provide timely financial reporting.  It highlights the need for ongoing investments in spectrum acquisition, network build-out—particularly low-band 600 MHz and nationwide 5G deployment—and the continual adaptation to technological developments to enhance service offerings, increase capacity and introduce new products to meet evolving customer data demands and remain competitive.  The filings warn that implementation of new and sophisticated technologies may give rise to scheduling or supplier delays, unexpected costs, regulatory permitting issues or customer dissatisfaction that could delay launches and diminish anticipated benefits, and that failures or disruptions of its own systems or those of third-party suppliers—including cyber-attacks, data breaches, equipment changes, migration from older technologies or billing system conversion—could compromise service quality, network reliability, customer and proprietary data confidentiality, and overall operational continuity, with potentially material adverse effects on financial condition, reputation and competitive position.  The Company also notes its dependence on external parties for network components, billing and customer-service support and the imperative to continually evaluate and reinforce its safeguards, access controls and information security practices in light of its status as critical infrastructure and evolving cyber threats.

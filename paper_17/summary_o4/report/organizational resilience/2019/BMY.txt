During the integration of our acquisition of Celgene, we are in the process of integrating a large number of manufacturing, operational and administrative systems—to achieve consistency throughout the combined company—including human capital management, portfolio rationalization, finance and accounting systems, sales operations and product distribution, pricing systems and methodologies, data security systems, compliance programs and internal controls processes. This integration is a complex, costly and time-consuming process and may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet financial reporting obligations if difficulties arise or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies occur. As part of our operating model transformation, we continue to streamline the company’s pricing and information technology infrastructure. We rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms—some managed, hosted or provided by third parties—to conduct our business, and acknowledge that any significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of these critical systems or infrastructure could negatively impact operations. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information and business interruption from industrial espionage attacks, malware and other cyber-attacks; although we have invested in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices of our data and maintain cyber insurance, we cannot assure that our efforts will prevent future breakdowns or breaches. In addition, under our distribution channel agreements, we receive weekly information on distributor inventory levels and out-movement to monitor months on hand for compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain a governance process to escalate and resolve any potential questions or concerns regarding sales in excess of expected demand.

The company’s retail store operations have required substantial investment in information systems and related infrastructure, and its business and reputation may be materially impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins or other events; system redundancy and continuity measures may be inadequate, and business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient, such that failures or disruptions could prevent access to the company’s online services, interfere with customer transactions or impede manufacturing and shipping. The company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personally identifiable information (PII) regarding customers and employees, and it devotes significant resources to network and data security, including encryption and authentication technologies, but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may occur. Although the company takes steps to secure information provided to third parties, it monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, yet remains exposed to risks such as employees or customers being fraudulently induced to disclose user names, passwords or other sensitive information that could compromise its IT systems. In addition to general data security obligations, the company is subject to laws and regulations on privacy, data security, data localization, digital platforms, Internet, telecommunications and mobile communications, and it makes public statements about its use and disclosure of PII through privacy policies and website statements; failure to comply with these requirements or public commitments could lead to litigation, government investigations, penalties or fines. The company is also subject to specific regulatory requirements relating to health data—entailing additional privacy, security and breach notification obligations—and payment card data under industry standards, and any compromise of these systems or failure to adhere to these security standards could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results.

Costco relies extensively on information technology to process transactions, compile results, and manage its business, and failure or disruption of its primary and back-up systems could adversely affect operations; a failure to adequately update existing systems and implement new systems could harm the business and adversely affect results of operations; given the very high volume of transactions processed, maintaining uninterrupted operation of business-critical systems is important; systems, including back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors or misfeasance by employees; if systems are damaged or cease to function properly, significant investments may be required to fix or replace them and operations may suffer interruptions, any such material interruption potentially having a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations; Costco is making and will continue to make investments to improve or advance critical information systems and processing capabilities, but failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace could be harmful, as excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and delay or reduce anticipated benefits; significant system changes increase the risk of disruption, although the company believes its change management process should mitigate this risk; targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make optimal investments, or committing above or below actual needs could result in loss of competitive position and adversely impact financial condition and results of operations; potential problems and interruptions in implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce operational efficiency and may not provide anticipated benefits on schedule or at expected cost; the company previously identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over systems that support financial reporting, completed remediation measures during 2019, and concluded its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 1, 2019, although maintenance of effective controls is critical to sustaining investor confidence and stock price; failure to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information, including secure transmission of confidential information over public networks and reliance on third-party cloud service providers, could damage reputation, incur substantial additional costs, lead to litigation or government actions, and require significant further resource allocation for information security; the company has security measures and controls to protect its information technology network but acknowledges that evolving techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may not be anticipated, timely discovered or countered, or adequately prevented, with any breach potentially resulting in significant legal and financial exposure, reputational harm and operational disruption; Costco accepts payments through various methods, relies on third parties for payment transaction processing, and is subject to evolving payment card industry data security standards governing the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data, and if internal systems are breached, it may face fines, increased transaction fees, loss of card acceptance and adverse effects on business and operating results; failure to develop and maintain a relevant omnichannel experience for members, including timely improvements to websites and mobile applications, could impair competitiveness and adversely affect results of operations; and the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has enhanced competition by improving customersâ€™ ability to comparison-shop, and some competitors may have greater technology capabilities, so inability to respond effectively to these technological and market trends could result in lost market share and negatively affect financial results.

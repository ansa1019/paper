Our disclosures warn that disruptions of critical information systems or material security breaches could materially harm our business, customer relations and financial condition by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss or damage of intellectual property, business disruptions or delays in product deliveries. We recognize that information technology underpins our ability to operate efficiently—supporting customer interfacing, financial accuracy, planning, forecasting, compliance and production of financial statements—and that failure to allocate and effectively manage the resources needed to build and sustain proper technology infrastructure could impair our operations. We collect, store and process personally identifiable information for customers, employees and business partners, employing user names, passwords, encryption and authentication technologies, yet we acknowledge that unauthorized access through phishing, hacking, employee error, malfeasance or vendor system vulnerabilities could compromise data confidentiality, integrity, reliability and availability. To mitigate these risks, we maintain programs to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and continuously enhance our network security, but evolving intrusion techniques and third-party system defects may outpace our defenses, leading to data loss, product functionality issues with potential patient safety implications, product recalls or field actions. Furthermore, our business is subject to complex, evolving global laws and regulations governing privacy, data protection and information security—including the EU’s GDPR, the US CCPA and HIPAA and related foreign directives—and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to significant regulatory fines, litigation, reputational harm and loss of customer confidence.

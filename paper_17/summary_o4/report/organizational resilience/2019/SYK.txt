Stryker’s operational resilience and competitive positioning depend heavily on its information technology capabilities, as the company relies extensively on IT systems, networks and services—including Internet sites, cloud and SaaS solutions, data hosting and processing facilities, hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some managed by third parties—to conduct critical business processes such as order processing, shipping, customer support, invoicing and financial reporting. The firm is in the process of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning system that will replace many existing operating and financial systems, underscoring its investment in IT architecture and process automation to enhance organizational agility and support business strategies, although any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in design or implementation could materially impair operational flexibility. Integration of acquisitions, including the need to align and combine information technology, communications and other systems, further illustrates the importance of acquiring, deploying, combining and reconfiguring IT resources in support of business process understanding and synergy realization. Stryker recognizes evolving cybersecurity threats to the security, confidentiality, availability and integrity of its IT systems and customer data and has made investments in network and system monitoring, specialized personnel, employee training and security policies, yet admits that a breach or failure—whether of its products, customer networks or third-party services—could expose the company to reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, litigation and regulatory action. As a global medical technology provider handling sensitive personal information, the company is also subject to comprehensive data privacy and protection regulations, including Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, which impose strict requirements on the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personally identifiable healthcare information and carry significant penalties for non-compliance, thereby emphasizing the firm’s focus on information management capability to deliver accurate, timely, reliable, secure, confidential and connected data access tailored to changing business needs.

Procter & Gamble maintains an information and operational technology (“IT/OT”) risk management program, supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross-functional stakeholders, that generates regular analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats and formal strategies presented to senior management, the audit committee and the board of directors. The company relies extensively on IT/OT systems, networks and services—ranging from internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, physical security systems and other hardware and software applications to third-party-hosted platforms—to support critical business processes including supplier ordering and materials management, production conversion, distribution and shipping, consumer marketing and sales, collection, transfer, storage and processing of stakeholder and personal data (including under evolving privacy regulations such as GDPR), financial and operational reporting, treasury and cash liquidity management, collaborative global communications, regulatory and legal compliance, data security and other essential functions. Recognizing that numerous and evolving information security threats—such as advanced persistent threats, malware, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial-of-service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and insider actors—pose risks to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data and critical operations, the company continually assesses potential vulnerabilities and invests in ongoing monitoring and system updates, specialized security skills, employee training and revised security policies for both P&G and its third-party providers. Periodic technology upgrades or deployments carry the risk of increased cybersecurity breaches or system failures that could disrupt the ability to order, manufacture, ship and process payments and could lead to inadvertent data loss or integrity issues; any significant unavailability of key IT/OT systems or service-provider platforms may expose P&G to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and legal harm, while the costs and operational consequences of incident response and remediation could be significant. In addition, Procter & Gamble’s Global Business Services organization provides standardized technology, processes and data tools to enable global business units, market operations and corporate functions to gain insights and better serve consumers at low cost with minimal capital investment, and the company identifies discontinuities in its internal information and data systems as a potential risk that could negatively impact its global supply chain and overall business results.

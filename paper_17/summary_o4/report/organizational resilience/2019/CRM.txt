We disclose that our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes is subject to the evolving scope and complexity of our information technology capabilities, including security measures at our third-party data-center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and underlying Internet infrastructure, which if breached or disabled could result in unauthorized access to, or denial of access to, our or our customers’ data and IT systems, damage our reputation and harm our financial performance.  Our cloud services incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software that must be coordinated through robust business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, ongoing investment in infrastructure capacity and disaster-recovery and business-continuity arrangements across multiple distributed facilities that we do not control.  We face continual challenges in integrating acquisitions and new technologies into our existing IT architecture while maintaining consistent security standards, tailoring performance, ensuring accurate, timely, reliable, secure and confidential information provision, and seamlessly transferring and replicating data.  The continuous evolution of our internal IT systems—through enhancements, updates and adoption of new network, browser and mobile platforms—increases system complexity and vulnerability, requiring the mobilization of processes, people and technology, allocation of resources to monitoring and mitigation efforts, and execution of change management.  Moreover, evolving data-privacy and cybersecurity regulations such as the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA impose additional requirements on our digital infrastructure, cross-border data transfers and operational practices, necessitating further investments to adapt our information management capability to meet regulatory and customer expectations, maintain organizational agility and preserve our competitive advantage.

The report acknowledges that the company’s ability to coordinate its assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships increasingly depends on advanced technologies and information systems that must be acquired, deployed and reconfigured in support of business strategies and work processes. It states that rapid technological change in the medical device industry requires continued financial and organizational commitment to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies, apply them cost-effectively across product lines and markets, and integrate information technologies with research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance when assimilating acquired businesses. The company emphasizes its reliance on complex, multinational information technology systems and third-party vendor technologies to process, transmit and store electronic information for day-to-day operations, while warning that such complexity creates vulnerability to cyber-attacks, system failures, data privacy breaches and unauthorized intrusions. It describes the need for ongoing investment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems, develop new systems that keep pace with evolving information-processing technologies, regulatory standards and changing customer patterns, and comply with U.S. and international privacy and security laws such as HIPAA and GDPR, including data localization requirements. The report cautions that failures in IT governance or security could result in unauthorized access to patient data, theft of intellectual property, operational disruption or even patient harm, which in turn could trigger regulatory scrutiny, enforcement actions, loss of customers, increased operating expenses or other adverse effects on the business. It further notes that integrating acquired entities poses additional IT risks related to defects or vulnerabilities in their systems during integration into the company’s IT environment.

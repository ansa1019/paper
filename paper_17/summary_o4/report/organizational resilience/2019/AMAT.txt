Applied’s disclosures highlight several operational and organizational dimensions that plausibly relate to its IT capability, including its reliance on and management of information technology resources and systems to support global manufacturing, supply chain, financial reporting and customer service.  The company identifies as a risk the “performance of third party providers of outsourced functions, including … information technology,” and warns that “information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider,” could interrupt its manufacturing operations or disrupt the flow of materials and services.  Applied further cautions that “the failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements” may prevent it from realizing anticipated productivity improvements and cost efficiencies or could cause “interruptions in service and operational difficulties” across order tracking, manufacturing and shipping, inventory forecasting, supply-chain management, workforce allocation, financial data aggregation and reporting, and overall business management.  In addition, the risk factors discuss cybersecurity threats and incidents arising from the collection, use, transmission and storage of confidential data and intellectual property on its IT systems, noting that despite significant investments in network security, encryption and other defenses, breaches could lead to business disruption, misappropriation or corruption of critical data, litigation, reputational damage, data privacy issues and increased costs, and that evolving privacy and information-security regulations may impose significant compliance expenses or penalties for non-compliance.

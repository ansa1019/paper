UPS discloses that it “relies heavily on information technology networks and systems, including the internet and a number of internally-developed systems and applications, to manage or support a wide variety of important business processes and activities throughout our operations,” such as receiving package-level information in advance of physical receipt, tracking items through its delivery systems, planning deliveries, executing billing and reporting financial and operational data. It further notes that “…franchised center locations and businesses we have acquired also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities.” UPS acknowledges that the provision of service and operation of its networks involve the collection, storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary and sensitive data, including personal information, which it regularly moves across national borders and which subjects it to evolving and sometimes conflicting privacy, data protection and data security laws—such as the EU’s GDPR and data localization requirements—that impose significant and likely increasing compliance costs. The company warns that its information technology systems, as well as those of its franchisees, acquired businesses and third-party providers (including cloud service providers and third-party delivery services), are “susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns” from programming errors, defects, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, ransomware and insider misconduct, and that such events could “materially adversely affect” its operations, reputation and customer confidence, potentially requiring substantial additional spending on data and system security. UPS states that it “has invested and continue[s] to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans,” yet concedes it “cannot provide any assurances that such events and impacts will not be material in the future.” In its management’s discussion and analysis, UPS reports capital expenditures of $774 million in 2019 for “information technology”—attributed to continuing development of technology-enabled solutions and capitalized software projects—and identifies “technology equipment and software licenses” as significant components of its other operating expenses, underscoring ongoing investments in its IT infrastructure and capability to support and enhance its business strategies and processes.

In order to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. We may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner, and our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. We may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. The growth and expansion of our business and product, subscription, and support offerings places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources, and any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, disrupt our existing end-customer relationships, reduce demand for or limit us to smaller deployments of our platform, or harm our business performance and operating results. Additionally, reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter means that any failure of our systems related to order review and processing or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels. A network or data security incident may allow unauthorized access to our network or data, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results, and our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing installed end-customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our end-customersâ€™ networks and leave them unprotected against the latest security threats.

The company’s IT capability is evident in its extensive deployment of cloud and network infrastructures and in-house software platforms to support and enhance its streaming service and related business processes. As it scales its streaming operations, the company is “developing technology and utilizing third-party ‘cloud’ computing services” and has architected its systems to run predominantly on Amazon Web Services, such that “any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.” In parallel, it has built and deployed its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”/“CDN”) to efficiently stream high volumes of video over the internet and monitors interconnection with Internet Service Providers, noting that if ISPs do not interconnect or charge for network access, “our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted.” The company further leverages a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to recommend and merchandise content to users, to process payments and to maintain and modify its user interfaces, with technology and development expenses reflecting investments in personnel, hardware, software, and enhancements to its recommendation, merchandising and streaming delivery infrastructure. It acknowledges that “interruptions in these systems, or with the Internet in general, could make our service unavailable or degraded,” and that cybersecurity threats—ranging from denial-of-service attacks to unauthorized data access—pose risks of service degradation, data breaches, and intellectual property loss, for which it has implemented systems and processes that require “ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change.” The company relies on encryption and authentication technologies to secure member data and is subject to evolving privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA that could limit its ability to collect and use information. Agreements with device manufacturers, MVPDs and telecommunications operators expand its capability to stream content across consumer electronics platforms, while at the same time partnerships and multi-service discovery interfaces influence member acquisition and retention. Finally, changes in network operator practices—such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps or discriminatory network management—and broader regulatory developments affecting net neutrality, data localization and industry-specific levies may impose additional operational costs, require system modifications or restrict access to its service, thereby testing the firm’s ability to align its technological resources and governance practices with its business strategy and market dynamics.

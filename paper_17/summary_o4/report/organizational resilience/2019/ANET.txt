The company’s risk disclosures emphasize that its business depends on the overall demand for information technology, network connectivity and access to data and applications, noting that the rapidly evolving cloud networking market—with increased virtualization, cloud computing and end-customer requirements—demands comprehensive, programmable, modular and reliable solutions that integrate hardware and software, support workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and interoperate with a wide range of third-party virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services. To scale rapidly and sustain competitive advantage, the firm must manage an increasingly complex array of internal systems and processes—including hardware and software development, contract manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, fulfillment, maintenance and support—and enhance its operational, financial and management controls, reporting processes and procedures by implementing more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems. The company pursues substantial investments in research and development, acquisitions and strategic partnerships—such as with merchant silicon vendors—to introduce new products and features, address emerging technological trends and shifting industry standards, and build upon its technology leadership, while acknowledging that product development, forecasting and supply-chain sourcing are complex, require significant upfront capital and, if not executed efficiently, can lead to inventory imbalances, delays in product introductions or deficiencies in system capabilities. The firm also highlights its reliance on sophisticated forecasting and data analytics, contractual and procedural safeguards with suppliers and channel partners, training programs to deploy and support its solutions effectively, and compliance systems for export, privacy, data protection and environmental regulations, all of which are integral to mobilizing and deploying IT resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to drive operational flexibility, process optimization, firm performance and long-term value creation.

Goldman Sachs acknowledges that its businesses are highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies, and that as its client base, geographical reach and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions increase, developing and maintaining its operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging, with greater risk of systems or human error; accordingly, the firm has made and expects to continue to make significant investments in technology and human capital resources in connection with its consumer-oriented activities, including its digital lending and deposit platform, Marcus, its credit card activities and the planned launch of its transaction banking activities, while its increasing reliance on mobile and cloud technologies, and on distributed ledger technology, heightens cybersecurity and operational risks and requires ongoing enhancement of its information security program, resiliency plans and third-party vendor oversight to protect confidential and other information processed, stored or transmitted through its computer systems and networks; notwithstanding the proliferation of technology-based risk and control systems, Goldman Sachs underscores that its businesses ultimately rely on people as its greatest resource, since human error, malfeasance or other misconduct can evade technological safeguards, and compliance with evolving laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance, encryption and data-on-shoring necessitates continuous modification of policies, procedures and technology for information security, reflecting the firm’s evolving IT capability in mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to support business needs, regulatory requirements and the coordination of the firm’s assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships.

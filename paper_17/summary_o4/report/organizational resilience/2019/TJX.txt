Increasing our size and complexity may put additional pressure on various functions across our business, including systems (including information technology systems), and our multiple banners and locations increase the risk that our systems, controls, practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations. We rely heavily on information technology systems, including those of suppliers and service providers, to manage all key aspects of our business, including planning, purchasing, sales, supply chain management, inventory management, point-of-sale processing, e-commerce, human resources, financial management, communications, safeguarding information, and compliance with legal obligations. This reliance requires us to accurately anticipate our current and future information technology needs and successfully develop, implement and maintain appropriate systems, as well as ensure the ongoing integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, including related back-up systems. Compromises of our data security, disruptions in our information technology systems, or failure to satisfy the information technology needs of our business could result in material loss or liability, materially impact our operating results or materially harm our reputation. We maintain policies, procedures and controls designed to reduce the risk of data security compromises and information technology failures or disruptions, but these measures require costly and ongoing investment in technologies, hiring, training and compliance. Furthermore, there is a risk of material business disruption, liability and reputational damage associated with ongoing actions intended to update, enhance, modify or replace our systems and infrastructure, including from not accurately capturing and maintaining data, efficiently testing and implementing changes, realizing the expected benefit of the change, and managing the potential disruption and diversion of internal teamsâ€™ attention as the changes are implemented. Our risk disclosures also highlight the need to implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving digital communication channels and to meet customer expectations through various digital platforms, including digital/social media, email, mobile and e-commerce, failure of which may impact our financial results. In our sourcing operations, risks include information technology challenges, and our ability to employ and retain associates in key areas such as information technology functions is critical to satisfying our business needs.

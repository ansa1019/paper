Bank of America’s retail and wholesale businesses harness a leading digital banking platform, www.bankofamerica.com, serving over 38 million active users—of which more than 29 million are mobile—while plans to expand automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, web- and cloud-based products and remote connectivity solutions underline the firm’s commitment to mobilizing IT-based resources in support of evolving business strategies and work processes. The corporation maintains an extensive, high-availability infrastructure of computer and data management systems, security controls and backup facilities, both internally and through third-party providers and financial services industry utilities, which are subject to continuous updates to remain compliant with global laws, rules and regulations. These updates, together with system integrations, carry significant operational risks such as business interruptions from technology project implementation challenges, hardware or software failures, electronic trading and algorithmic platform disruptions, aging infrastructure breakdowns, telecommunications outages and natural or politically driven events. Cybersecurity threats are pervasive and evolving—including ransomware, malicious code, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, state-sponsored campaigns and sophisticated social engineering—and may lead to unauthorized access, misuse or destruction of confidential, personal or proprietary data, prolonged system outages, regulatory fines, litigation, reputational harm and material losses. As a result, the firm continuously invests in protective measures, incident detection, monitoring systems, vulnerability remediation, change management and operational resilience practices to safeguard information confidentiality, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access and to tailor these capabilities in response to shifting customer behaviors, market dynamics, external influences and regulatory requirements.

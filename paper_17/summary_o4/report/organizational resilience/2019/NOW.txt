The annual report describes significant investments in and reliance on information technology resources and capabilities to support business strategies and work processes, including the continual optimization and scaling of its cloud-based software-as-a-service platform and on-premises offerings through geographically distributed data centers, interconnectivity, infrastructure hardware, software, IT services and customer support operations; the development and delivery of digitized workflows and applications intended to automate processes, integrate disparate systems and enable efficient coordination of assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions; the need to identify, innovate in and deliver emerging digital technologies—public and private clouds, scalable databases, mobile and consumer-style user experiences, social and collaboration tools, machine learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, high-velocity robotic automation, security, cryptography, and internal software development operations—to meet evolving customer requirements and maintain competitive advantage; the provision of business process planning, IT systems-architecture planning and implementation services to ensure successful deployment and integration within customers’ digital environments; ongoing efforts to achieve and sustain industry-specific and government security certifications such as FedRAMP and DoD Impact Level 4 to address regulatory, privacy and cross-border data requirements and to bolster information confidentiality, timeliness, reliability and connectivity; the material allocation of personnel, financial and capital resources to research and development, sales and marketing, professional services and training in support of platform innovation, process optimization and market responsiveness; and the emphasis on monitoring, securing and managing data storage, transmission and processing, including third-party provider relationships, to mitigate cyber-security risks, prevent service disruptions or defects that could harm customer satisfaction, operational efficiency and overall firm performance.

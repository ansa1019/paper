Our annual report discloses that our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors and that we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information; it warns that measures we take to avoid or mitigate material cyber incidents can be expensive, may be insufficient or obsolete, and that rapidly evolving threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats, potentially causing data misappropriation, interruption of services and damage to our brand, reputation and customer confidence; we also highlight our reliance on network systems, the internet and electronic delivery systems—many of our products and services are delivered electronically and our customers depend on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver data reliably across computer-based networks—and we maintain disaster recovery plans with backup facilities for our primary data centers, although systems are not always fully redundant and our planning may not always be sufficient or effective; we acknowledge that we outsource certain functions to third-party service and cloud-infrastructure providers to leverage specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies, but such providers may fail to meet contractual, regulatory or confidentiality requirements or experience system breakdowns, outages, cyber-attacks or other adverse conditions; we emphasize that development, maintenance and support of our offerings depend on the knowledge, experience and abilities of our skilled employees and on deploying improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements; we invest significantly in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives, make ongoing productivity and modernization efforts to standardize and simplify our technology, reduce security risk, augment process maturity and reinforce controls and compliance, yet we cannot guarantee these investments will yield increased revenues; and we have bolstered our data analytics, machine-learning and artificial-intelligence capabilities through strategic acquisitions—most notably kensho in 2018 for next-generation analytics, AI, machine learning and data visualization systems as well as 451 Research, Panjiva and RateWatch—to further integrate and leverage technology resources in support of our business strategies and work processes.

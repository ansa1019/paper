Microsoft describes its evolution from traditional software licensing toward a coordinated, cloud-centric model that mobilizes and deploys IT-based resources—digital technologies, data management, analytics, security, and human capital—in support of platform-based ecosystems, business process integration, and interfirm relationships. Its strategic vision, to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence, has led to significant investments in cloud and AI engineering, datacenter and network infrastructure, process automation, and organizational changes to drive accountability, eliminate obstacles to innovation, and enhance operational flexibility. Success in cloud-based services, including Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and third-party developer platforms, depends on delivering compelling cloud-based experiences that meet evolving business needs across PCs, mobile devices, servers, IoT endpoints, and sensors, maintaining utility, compatibility, performance, reliability, security, and connectivity, and broadening platform-agnostic access. The company continuously engineers more secure products and services, enhances security and reliability features, improves deployment of software updates and mitigation technologies, and maintains a digital security infrastructure and monitoring systems to protect its internal IT environment and customer data against cyberthreats. Substantial expenditures for research and development, acquisitions, and partnerships—such as those in LinkedIn, GitHub, and IoT—enable Microsoft to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure technology resources and capabilities, integrate on-premises software with cloud offerings, and support agile decision-making, strategic resource allocation, and performance outcomes across its productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and personal computing segments.

Our business depends on evolving and maintaining robust information technology capabilities to support product development, operations, customer engagement and financial reporting, requiring significant ongoing investments in internal and cloud-based infrastructure, data processing and storage, security protections and high-availability systems. We operate in a dynamic technological environment characterized by changing industry standards, frequent new product introductions and the proliferation of mobile and online platforms, and must continuously innovate new features, business models and integrations with emerging technologies to meet customer needs and remain competitive. We rely on both internal IT systems and third-party services—including public cloud providers, open source components and external vendors—to fulfill orders, host online activities and process sensitive customer and workforce data, and any interruption, system integration challenge, scaling difficulty, or cyberattack may impair service availability, disrupt business operations and harm our reputation and financial results. We host, collect, use and retain large volumes of personal and business data and employ commercially available security technologies and business controls to limit unauthorized access, but vulnerabilities from software bugs, unsupported customer environments, social engineering or evolving attack techniques cannot be entirely eliminated. Regulatory requirements under laws such as GDPR and CCPA impose ongoing compliance and operational changes, and any failure to implement system enhancements, maintain network security, execute disaster recovery plans or address emerging threats could result in data breaches, litigation, increased operating costs, loss of customer confidence and material adverse effects on our business performance.

The annual report emphasizes that our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to those systems, warning that system interruptions, errors or downtime arising from technological failures, changes to our systems, linkages with third‐party systems, power failures, natural disasters or cyber incidents could significantly disrupt our ability to process, record and monitor large transaction volumes and could materially harm our business and operations; to mitigate these risks we have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data, limit unauthorized access through internal authentication measures, restrict employee access to nonpublic data, deploy advanced monitoring systems to detect suspicious activity, maintain a backup and recovery infrastructure with geographically dispersed facilities and routinely test our business continuity and disaster recovery plans and incident management protocols; we also rely on external service providers for key technology, processing, servicing and support functions under contractual control standards, ongoing performance monitoring and transition planning to manage third‐party risks; our phase‐out of LIBOR is expected to require significant operational work to transition to new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models; capital expenditures in 2019 included $165 million of internally developed software and totaled approximately 7 percent of net revenues, reflecting continued investments in software and technology enhancements, and we expect to invest 3 to 5 percent of revenues on technology projects over the longer term; furthermore, planned acquisitions such as USAA-IMCO and TD Ameritrade will involve integrating operational, financial and management information systems and controls across multiple platforms; and our risk management framework incorporates model governance, cybersecurity, fraud prevention, third-party oversight and control testing programs to manage the evolving operational, compliance and information security risks inherent in our digital infrastructure.

The company acknowledges that intense competition drives investments in technology and infrastructure, and that rapid global expansion places significant strain on its systems, technical performance and internal processes. It warns that new products and services can present difficult technology challenges and risk service disruptions or failures, and that failure to realize benefits from technology investments could result in asset impairment. The risk factors also highlight exposures to data theft, computer intrusions, viruses, phishing, system outages, and the complexity and optimization challenges of its fulfillment network and data centers as capacity grows. To mitigate these risks, the company undertakes initiatives to add software and hardware, upgrade network infrastructure, improve system stability, and enhance operational efficiency, while also relying on third-party encryption, authentication, content delivery, and back-office systems. Management’s discussion further details substantial and increasing spending on technology and content, including payroll for computer scientists, engineers, and designers, infrastructure costs for servers, networking equipment and data centers to support AWS’s global compute, storage and database services, and strategic investments in innovative software, electronic devices, wireless connectivity, artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance the customer experience, optimize processes, and leverage cross-functional systems across its expanding global operations.

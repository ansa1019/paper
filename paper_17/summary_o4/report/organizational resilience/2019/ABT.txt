Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems that support both its infrastructure and products and enable the management and protection of large volumes of personal and proprietary data, and it acknowledges that the size and complexity of these IT systems makes them susceptible to cyber attacks, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption, any of which could result in increased costs, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks, including third-party hacking attempts that may compromise or steal protected data or proprietary information. To reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data, monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment, and incurs significant capital expenditures principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment, investments in information technology and laboratory instruments placed with customers. Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings, is subject to regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders, and recognizes that a breach of protected personal information could result in regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs, reputational damage, lost revenue and fines or penalties.

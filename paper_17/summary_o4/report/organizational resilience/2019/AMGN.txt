The report discloses that Amgen’s business is heavily dependent on sophisticated information technology systems—including cloud services and network-connected control systems—to support research and development, clinical and commercial manufacturing processes, product sales and distribution, and other critical functions, and warns that any breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of those IT systems and data, interrupt operations and damage the company’s reputation. It notes that these systems contain and utilize large volumes of sensitive data—intellectual property, trade secrets, financial, regulatory, strategic and personal information—which in many cases are processed, managed, stored or transmitted by third-party service providers, thereby heightening risks related to data privacy, security and compliance. The company emphasizes evolving global privacy and data protection requirements, such as the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA, and the prospect of substantial penalties for noncompliance, and describes its ongoing investments in monitoring, protection and resilience of IT assets and controls. Dependencies on third-party logistics and manufacturing networks, reliance on backup power for Puerto Rico operations, and the need to maintain networked control systems and support business continuity further underscore Amgen’s implicit reliance on IT-capability-enabled connectivity, process automation, and strategic resource allocation to sustain and protect its integrated operations.

The Company’s disclosures emphasize its ongoing need to develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and invest in e-business capabilities—identified as a critical competitive factor alongside technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line and customer support—to avoid technological obsolescence and support market responsiveness; its growth strategy explicitly includes continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure, including expanded e-commerce platforms and operational infrastructure to enable cross-selling and enhance the customer experience; to manage and coordinate its global assets, processes and interfirm relationships the Company periodically implements new enterprise resource planning software and other business applications, while acknowledging that unanticipated interruptions, loss of data or reduced functionality in these systems could disrupt its ability to provide quotes, take orders and run its operations; moreover, the Company relies on its information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and support a wide range of critical business processes—exposures that render it vulnerable to natural disasters, power and telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, data breaches, ransomware, unauthorized access and non-redundant systems—any of which could materially interrupt production and shipments, harm its reputation and customer relationships, expose it to civil or criminal penalties under evolving global data privacy and security regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and adversely affect its financial results.

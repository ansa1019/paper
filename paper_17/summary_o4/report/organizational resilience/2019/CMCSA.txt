The company’s risk disclosures emphasize that “our businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments,” and that our success is “dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies,” warning that “if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so” or select “technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers,” our operations could be “adversely affected.” We cite specific technology initiatives, including the “deployment of Flex and Sky Q set-top boxes and wireless gateways” to “more easily aggregate linear and OTT programming choices,” illustrating investments in digital infrastructure, IT architecture and connectivity to support evolving consumer behaviors. The report acknowledges reliance on “network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations, and programming delivery,” and cautions that “cyber threats and attacks … are constantly evolving,” which heightens the risk of “degradation or disruption of our products and services” or compromise of “confidential or technical business information.” We further disclose risks associated with maintaining “customer, personnel and vendor data” in “third-party’s information technology systems,” including threats of “misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information” and the need to meet “open internet and data privacy requirements.” Finally, we note our dependence on “third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our products and services” and that failures by these vendors to meet “our specifications or provide the equipment, products or services we need in a timely manner” could adversely affect our service offerings, underscoring the critical role of IT capability, integration, governance and resource deployment in sustaining competitive advantage, operational efficiency, business transformation and customer experience.

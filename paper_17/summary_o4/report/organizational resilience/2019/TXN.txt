The Company’s disclosures recognize that its global operations expose it to potential disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks and that breaches, disruptions or other incidents affecting its information technology systems or those of its customers, vendors and other third parties could compromise its IT networks, corrupt or lose data, result in unauthorized release of confidential or proprietary information, disrupt manufacturing and other operations, trigger remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, and thereby adversely affect operating results and reputation. It further cautions that cybersecurity and other threats to these information technology systems are frequent and constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of defending against them, and that a breach or other incident in a supplier’s IT systems could likewise result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. In describing its market channels, the Company highlights its web presence and global sales and applications teams as critical to the design-in journey of approximately 100,000 customers, reflecting reliance on digital infrastructure to support customer relationships and competitive positioning. The discussion of strategic, business and organizational changes—including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions—underscores the importance of effectively deploying information technology resources to implement business transformations and support objectives. In its management’s discussion and analysis, the Company details substantial annual investments in research and development and in software licenses to improve existing technologies, develop new products to meet changing customer demands and enhance production processes, illustrating the mobilization of IT-based resources in coordination with other assets to support business strategies and maintain competitive advantage.

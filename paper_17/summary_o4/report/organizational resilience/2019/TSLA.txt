The operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks. Our products contain complex information technology systems and are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our products and their systems, and maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches and other cyber-attacks. Our volume production of multiple vehicles necessitates continued development, maintenance and improvement of our information technology systems in the U.S. and abroad, including at Gigafactory Shanghai, such as systems for product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. The implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and disruptions or deficiencies may affect our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results, protect our intellectual property, manage our data and inventory, procure parts and supplies, manufacture, sell, deliver and service vehicles, and achieve and maintain compliance with tax laws and other regulations. Automotive sales revenue includes access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air software updates, which are provisioned upon transfer of control and recognized over time as stand-ready obligations. Furthermore, regardless of the veracity of any reports, unauthorized access to or hacking of our products, their systems or data could negatively affect our brand, harm our business and prospects and expose us to legal claims, and we have been the subject of such reports in the past.

Our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of such offerings in response to rapid and continuing technological change, exemplified by digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings and by emerging developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, the Internet of Things, quantum computing and “as-a-service” solutions; technological developments of this kind may materially affect the cost to and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of as-a-service solutions, the nature of our revenue recognition, while some new technologies have reduced or replaced portions of our historical services, causing clients to defer spending pending evaluation. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these developments by driving innovation to expand into new growth areas and by making strategic investments in new technology at sufficient speed and scale to sustain our competitive advantage, yet we operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which new technology entrants and alternative offerings may render our services less differentiated or competitive. We depend on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to facilitate communication among our global locations, people, clients, alliance partners and vendors, and as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure expands—through mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services—the risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases and the challenge of maintaining effective security measures and protocols intensifies. In delivering services and solutions, we manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client and Accenture data, including personal data, with such activities expected to grow through the use of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and analytics, all of which underscore our need to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other firm resources to effectively support evolving client business strategies and work processes. Our consulting revenues, reflecting technology integration, are measured over time using input-based methods—recognizing revenue proportionally to costs incurred relative to total estimated costs—while our outsourcing revenues represent ongoing, repeatable services to transition, run and manage client systems and business functions, illustrating our competence in operating IT assets and processes in support of clients’ critical operations. Failure to sufficiently invest in and adapt to new technology, to make actionable and well-timed investment decisions or to integrate technology capabilities with our organizational processes and resources could materially impair our services and solutions, our results of operations and our ability to transform firms into competitive forces through enhanced IT capability.

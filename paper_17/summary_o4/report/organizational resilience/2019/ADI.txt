We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to maintain financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, preserve confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities, and operate critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email, and we also depend on external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities; our IT systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns from power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and security breaches of our IT systems or those of our partners—despite our use of confidentiality agreements and information security practices—could result in the loss of sales and customers, significant incremental costs, reputational damage and the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information.

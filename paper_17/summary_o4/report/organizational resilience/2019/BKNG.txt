Booking Holdings discloses that its business critically depends on scalable, reliable information technology infrastructure, including data centers, internally-developed and third-party systems, cloud computing and mobile platforms to support significant growth in consumer traffic and transactions across its brands. It warns that disruptions in system capacity, failures, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-incidents, as well as vulnerabilities from software bugs, phishing schemes or evolving circumvention capabilities, could materially impair service, damage its reputation and harm operations. The company employs encryption, multifactor authentication, user credentials and ongoing security-related investments to protect data and prevent unauthorized access, but acknowledges that new threats and breaches at third parties, such as payment processors, global distribution systems or affiliates, pose persistent information security and data privacy challenges. Booking Holdings also highlights that the widespread adoption of mobile devices and other smart technologies obliges it to continuously invest in mobile-optimized websites, apps, communication protocols and interface enhancements, and that changes in device operating systems or search algorithms could disadvantage its platforms. It relies on performance marketing through search engines and meta-search services, which are subject to algorithm and auction dynamics, and recognizes that the implementation or integration of new payment, enterprise resource planning or other IT systems may be disruptive and require significant resources. Finally, the company underscores the importance of effective IT governance, process automation, monitoring systems and organizational agility to manage rapid technology change, maintain operational flexibility and safeguard the reliability, security and timeliness of information supporting its global travel reservation services.

Danaher discloses that it relies on information technology systems, some provided and managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information—including sensitive business and personal data—and to manage and support critical business processes such as order fulfillment, billing, payments, shipping, service delivery and contractual obligations. The company warns that these systems, including software and IT embedded in remote monitoring products that connect to its networks, may be damaged, disrupted or shut down by cyber-attacks, malware, human error, power outages, hardware failures, utility failures, natural disasters or other unforeseen events, and that its system redundancy and disaster-recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Danaher further cautions that security breaches of its own or third-party systems could result in unauthorized disclosure, destruction or misappropriation of confidential information or personal data, interrupt operations or those of its customers and partners, delay production and shipments, cause defective products or services, damage customer, patient, partner and employee relationships, trigger legal claims and regulatory penalties under privacy laws such as HIPAA, GDPR and the CCPA, and adversely affect its financial statements and reputation. The company emphasizes that failure to maintain reliable IT systems and appropriate global data-privacy and security controls may lead to costly enforcement actions, civil litigation, increased security and remediation costs and reduced competitive flexibility, and notes that compliance with a patchwork of evolving data-privacy regulations has required significant investments and may necessitate further changes in its products or business models. In its Management’s Discussion, Danaher also highlights substantial investments—both organic and through acquisitions—aimed at addressing the rapid pace of technological change in computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization and at globalizing its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources to better serve customers worldwide and improve operational efficiency.

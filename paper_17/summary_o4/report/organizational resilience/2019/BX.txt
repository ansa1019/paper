We and our portfolio companies have become highly dependent on information systems and technology infrastructure—covering financial, accounting, communications and other data-processing platforms—that coordinate our assets, work processes and interfirm transactions; these systems face ongoing cybersecurity threats and attacks, such as phishing and social engineering, which could compromise data management, information confidentiality, connectivity and timely access, thereby interrupting business, causing reputational harm, exposing us to regulatory interventions and increasing our compliance and remediation costs. We rely on both in-house and third-party, including cloud-based, service providers, which introduces additional operational and IT governance challenges, and our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not fully mitigate system outages, breaches or supply-chain disruptions affecting our headquarters or networks. Simultaneously, the rapid evolution of global privacy laws—such as the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA—has heightened our obligations regarding information security, monitoring systems, governance, user access and data protection, demanding enhancements to our IT architecture, change-management practices and organizational decision-making to maintain operational flexibility, efficiency, compliance and competitive advantage in dynamic market and regulatory environments.

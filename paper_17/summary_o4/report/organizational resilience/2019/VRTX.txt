Vertex maintains and relies extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of its business, collecting, storing and transmitting confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property) in a secure manner to maintain confidentiality and integrity; the size and complexity of these information technology and information security systems makes them potentially vulnerable to service interruptions and security breaches or failures caused by software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents, any of which could cause breaches of data security, loss of critical data, business disruption and exposure to private and governmental legal actions. Although the company has implemented security measures and adopted a business continuity plan to address disruptions to its IT systems, cyber-attacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent system breakdowns or breaches or that liability insurance will fully cover claims arising from such events. In addition, the company is subject to various and evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law, which impose significant compliance obligations on the collection, transmission, storage and use of personal and health information and expose the company to substantial fines, criminal penalties and reputational harm in the event of non-compliance. The European Medicines Agency’s policy to publish clinical data submitted as part of marketing authorization applications may permit third-party review and analysis of raw clinical trial data, potentially increasing the risk of patient confidentiality breaches, enhanced scrutiny of trial results, dissemination of flawed analyses and unintended disclosure of confidential or competitive information. The use of social media platforms by third parties and employees introduces additional risks and challenges, including patient comments on drug efficacy or adverse experiences that may trigger reporting obligations, employee non-compliance with internal social media policies or regulations, loss of trade secrets or intellectual property, inappropriate disclosure of sensitive or protected personal information and the extension of data protection requirements to user-generated content, any of which could subject the company to liability, restrictive regulatory actions or damage to its business and reputation.

NextEra Energy and its subsidiary Florida Power & Light operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to coordinate and monitor a very large number of daily, geographically diverse transactions, to process and bill energy sales, to manage fuel procurement and regulatory reporting, and to support operational and capital planning; any failure, breach or disabling event affecting these sensitive and complex IT systems—whether due to operator error, severe weather, cyber incident or other external influences—could compromise confidential data, undermine critical business functions and controls, impair the companies’ ability to generate, purchase or transmit power, bill customers and collect payments, and materially harm their business, financial condition and prospects. The companies routinely add, modify and replace information systems, a process that is costly and involves integrating new or replacement systems with existing processes, implementing changes in accounting procedures and controls and ensuring accurate data conversion, and any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in these activities could increase costs, divert management and employee attention, hinder revenue tracking and undermine their ability to timely file required regulatory reports. In their retail businesses, NextEra and FPL require and sometimes share sensitive customer data with third‐party service providers, exposing them to the risk of data compromise or identity theft that could damage their reputation, diminish customer confidence and result in fines or legal claims. Moreover, the companies face ongoing threats from cyberattacks, terrorism and other malicious acts targeting both IT systems and other infrastructure facilities, which could limit operational flexibility, delay development and construction of new facilities and otherwise materially disrupt their operations.

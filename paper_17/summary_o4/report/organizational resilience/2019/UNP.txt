The company discloses that it relies on information technology in all aspects of its business, including systems operated internally or by third parties, and warns that insufficient capital to acquire, develop or implement new technologies such as positive train control (PTC) or upgrades to its transportation control systems could result in a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and broader transportation markets. It acknowledges significant investments in PTC and related technology—reporting $95 million spent in 2019—and allocates $255 million to technology and other systems, with the 2020 capital plan likewise targeting technology-enabled productivity and operational-efficiency improvements. Final implementation of PTC will require adaptation and integration of its system with other railroads’ differing implementation plans, reflecting the need for IT-architecture alignment and coordination of interfirm relationships. The company also highlights its multi-faceted safety program that utilizes technology, data, remote monitoring and risk assessment to detect rail defects, improve or close crossings and identify and mitigate operational risk, as well as Unified Plan 2020 and G55+0 initiatives that employ data-driven changes to reduce variability in network operations, optimize asset utilization, reduce “car touches,” consolidate terminals, improve freight-car velocity and train speed, and enable more agile, customer-responsive decision making. It further describes cybersecurity risks, noting dedicated resources to protect its technology systems and proprietary data, acknowledging normal-course cyber incidents, and emphasizing continual evaluation of attackers’ techniques alongside proactive monitoring, training, planning and prevention to guard against breaches that could disrupt service, compromise safety, expose sensitive data, incur financial losses or trigger regulatory fines. Additional disclosures mention capital investments in computer software, monitoring systems and supporting infrastructure, underscoring the integration of IT capability with operational flexibility, resource allocation and strategic management to enhance organizational effectiveness and sustain competitive performance.

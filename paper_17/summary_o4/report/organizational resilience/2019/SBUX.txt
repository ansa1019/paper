Starbucks discloses that many of its information technology systems—including point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services, rewards programs and various administrative functions hosted in both cloud-based and proprietary servers—store sensitive personal, financial, operational and proprietary data and are interdependent across its global operations and growth initiatives. The company acknowledges significant reliance on IT systems to support administrative functions, supply chain management, Starbucks Card, online business, mobile payments and ordering apps, loyalty functionality and digital relationships with customers. It further warns that any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of these systems—whether due to cyber-attacks, flawed third-party software or services, hardware or network failures, power outages, inadequate redundancy, transition issues during system upgrades, human error or physical theft—could disrupt store operations, impede product availability, diminish operational efficiency and harm its financial results. Starbucks also highlights its governance and compliance posture under evolving data protection regulations such as the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA, noting potential civil and criminal liabilities, private rights of action and penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue, as well as the need for substantial capital investments in security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services to prevent and remediate cybersecurity incidents. The company affirms ongoing significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel and maintains incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, while cautioning that such measures may not fully mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data loss or system unavailability. The management’s discussion and analysis further underscores that the success of strategic initiatives to drive convenience, brand engagement and growth through mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities is highly dependent on the effectiveness and availability of its IT architecture and infrastructure.

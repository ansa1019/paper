Berkshire’s risk disclosures note that data privacy regulations enacted in various jurisdictions address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information stored in its information systems, networks and facilities, and that failure to comply could result in reputational damage and significant penalties. The company relies on technology in virtually all aspects of its business, and certain of its information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks that are expected to become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of its technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties, and attacks could lead to loss of assets and critical information, remediation costs and reputational damage. Although Berkshire has taken steps intended to mitigate these risks—including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis—it acknowledges that a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could still adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Furthermore, the company has warned that if it is unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage with adverse effects on its results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity, and that cyber-attacks could further impair its ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information, potentially resulting in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher security or repair costs and other unpredictable impacts on its consolidated financial results.

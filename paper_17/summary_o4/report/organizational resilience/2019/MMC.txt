The company depends heavily on its information technology systems for conducting business and for providing essential data and analytics to manage operations, and its success is contingent upon maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost- and resource-efficient manner as its processes become increasingly digital. Strategic initiatives include investments in and partnerships with technology companies and investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support growth strategies, which may be costly, require significant capital expenditures and may not deliver the expected benefits or perform as anticipated. To remain competitive, the firm must anticipate and respond to digital disruption from traditional players and new entrants leveraging artificial intelligence, digital platforms, data analytics, robotics and blockchain to simplify and improve the client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and effect potentially disruptive industry changes. The company relies on the uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems, networks and safety control systems—both its own and those of key vendors and partners—to collect, process, transmit and store sensitive electronic information, including personal, confidential and proprietary data, and to share such information with third parties, which exposes the enterprise to vulnerabilities from cyberattacks, malware, ransomware, advanced persistent threats, social engineering, phishing, hacking, denial-of-service attacks, improper access and other internal and external threats that may not be detected for months or years. The expanding use of mobile devices, cloud services, open source software, social media and the Internet of Things further broadens the scope and complexity of the firm’s technology portfolio and increases the potential risk of security breaches. The company faces ongoing challenges in managing access controls in a complex environment, implementing, maintaining and upgrading safeguards such as data encryption—including encryption of data at rest—heightened monitoring and logging, source code scanning and multi-factor authentication, and ensuring timely deployment of security patches to address an ever-increasing volume of software vulnerabilities, all while competing for scarce cybersecurity talent capable of detecting, mitigating and remediating these risks. The complex process of integrating the information and technology systems of acquired businesses, such as the Jardine Lloyd Thompson acquisition, presents additional risk, as undiscovered system weaknesses or historical compromises in an acquired entity’s systems may expose the combined enterprise to unexpected liabilities, operational difficulties or increased vulnerability to cyberattack until integration is complete. The company has experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches—including malware incursions, excessive data access, employee misconduct, human error, loss of portable storage devices and misconfigurations—that underscore the need for robust data governance, employee training, technical safeguards and incident response protocols. Failure to protect information systems, to detect or respond to breaches in a timely manner or to comply with evolving global privacy, data protection and cybersecurity regulations—such as the EU’s GDPR, California’s CCPA, Brazil’s LGPD and other emerging laws with data localization requirements and cross-border transfer restrictions—could result in significant liability, regulatory enforcement actions, high fines, reputational harm and material adverse effects on business operations. Furthermore, the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans and key management succession practices must be regularly assessed and enhanced to mitigate the operational, financial and reputational impact of regional or global disasters, pandemics, terrorist attacks, power or telecommunications failures, cyber-incidents or control systems manipulations that disrupt information technology systems or delay data recovery, where available insurance or cyber coverage may be insufficient to fully cover the costs of recovery.

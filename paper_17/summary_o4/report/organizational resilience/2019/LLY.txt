The company’s disclosures emphasize its dependence on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, infrastructure and hardware to accumulate, process, store and transmit large volumes of confidential information—including trade secrets, clinical trial data, customer and employee records—and to support internal processes, intellectual property protection, product manufacturing, distribution and service delivery.  These IT systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions, security breaches, malicious intrusions and cyber-attacks from a variety of sources, including employee error, third-party failures, hackers, competitors and certain governments, and such events could result in compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft, destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of data, impair the company’s ability to secure IP rights, disrupt manufacturing or products and services that rely on IT systems, damage operations, customer relationships and reputation, and deprive the company of competitive advantages.  The company also notes that its third-party partners and outsourced service providers face similar IT system vulnerabilities and that failures in these relationships—whether in clinical trials oversight, IT support or other outsourced functions—could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of proprietary information.  To address these risks, the company maintains cyber liability insurance and continues to implement measures to protect, detect, respond to and minimize or prevent IT system risks and enhance resiliency, while acknowledging that such controls and insurance may not be sufficient in the face of evolving cyber-threats and data protection laws.

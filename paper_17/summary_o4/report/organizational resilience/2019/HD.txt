Home Depot relies extensively on information technology systems to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data—including sales, customer and associate data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing and order fulfillment—some of which are managed or provided by third-party cloud platform partners.  For these IT systems and processes to operate effectively and support an interconnected retail experience, we or our service providers must maintain and update them and make substantial investments in replacing legacy systems with successor systems, migrating applications to the cloud, outsourcing certain technology functions, designing or acquiring new systems with enhanced functionality and restructuring support systems and processes.  These strategic investments are designed to streamline operations, simplify customer interactions across physical and digital channels, enable shopping and engagement through a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms, and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network, yet involve significant risks, including system implementation failures, data loss or corruption, security process changes, cost overruns, implementation delays, interruptions of service and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements.  Through multiple online communities, knowledge centers, web-based tools and social media, we provide relevant product, project and other information to customers and gather feedback, while continually reviewing and updating our systems, processes and procedures to protect against evolving data protection and cybersecurity threats and to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, reliability, timeliness, connectivity and access levels required to meet changing business needs and regulatory requirements.  Disruptions, delays or performance issues in customer-facing technology systems or in our core IT infrastructure could impair our interconnected retail strategy, negatively affect the customer experience, compromise competitive advantage and adversely impact our financial performance and market responsiveness.  Furthermore, executing our one Home Depot, one supply chain and technology initiatives requires significant investment in additional IT personnel and specialized skills, effective coordination with third-party service providers and precise alignment of IT resources with organizational goals; failure to choose, deploy or integrate the right IT investments at the right pace could disrupt operations, hinder process optimization, limit operational flexibility and prevent us from fully leveraging IT capability as a strategic resource for competitive positioning, innovation and firm performance.

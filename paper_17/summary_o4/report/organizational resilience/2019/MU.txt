The Company discloses that it maintains a system of controls over the physical security of its facilities and a comprehensive information management capability to manage and store proprietary and sensitive data relating to its operations, employees, customers, and vendors, processing, storing, and transmitting large volumes of data; it acknowledges that unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to its network systems to steal trade secrets, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, deploy malicious software such as viruses or worms, or cause shutdowns. The Company highlights its reliance on advanced manufacturing and information technologies—capital equipment, facilities, and process development tools—and substantial capital investments, including co-development agreements for process and product technology, to support future growth, operating efficiencies, and product quality. It also describes its use of data-driven forecasts—including sales volumes, customer orders, contract prices, industry supply-and-demand analyses, seasonal factors, and economic trends—to value inventories, plan investments, assess goodwill and deferred tax assets, and manage hedging and derivative instruments to mitigate currency risk. Its global operations require coordination of supply chains, compliance with international regulations, and real-time monitoring of performance metrics and contractual obligations, implicitly underscoring the firm’s capability to mobilize and deploy information and technology resources to enhance its strategic decision-making, operational flexibility, and competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment.

PepsiCo discloses its dependence on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, to interface with customers and consumers, engage in marketing, optimize operations, manage supplier orders and inventory, operate facilities, maintain accurate financial and legal records, comply with regulatory requirements, communicate across its global operations and conduct research and development via data analytics. The company continues to invest in and incorporate digital tools and artificial intelligence to transform its manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations, to enhance brand management and to develop new commercial and consumer insights. It further seeks to build global e-commerce and digital marketing capabilities to deliver personalized consumer experiences through digital environments and devices, to distribute products effectively across existing and emerging trade channels, including e-commerce and hard discounters, and to respond rapidly to pricing pressures and changing consumer preferences. As part of its multi-year business transformation, PepsiCo is migrating to enterprise-wide systems solutions, enhancing the design and documentation of business processes and internal controls, and leveraging third-party providers for information technology support services such as payroll, benefits administration and finance and accounting functions, while monitoring performance to secure expected cost savings. The firm recognizes that it must allocate and manage resources to build and sustain its IT infrastructure, monitor networks and systems, upgrade security policies and employee training, coordinate with third-party vendors and execute change management to avoid disruptions to transaction processing, financial reporting and customer service, to realize anticipated productivity gains and cost efficiencies, and to preserve its competitive positioning in a rapidly evolving digital marketplace.

Our risk disclosures emphasize that our operations rely critically on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information and assets within our computer systems and networks and those of third-party service providers, and that a failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, including due to security breaches or cyber-attacks, could disrupt business, damage our reputation and cause losses. We depend significantly on effective information security and systems and on the integrity, timeliness and availability of the data our information systems use to price products and services, establish reserves, value investments and report financial results. Although we have implemented administrative and technical controls, protective actions and negotiated agreements with third parties to reduce cyber risks, these measures may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access, malware, business-compromise attacks, system failures or malfunctions, and could require significant additional resources to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or recover lost data or assets. We are subject to an evolving array of privacy and data security regulations—including the New York Department of Financial Services’ cybersecurity regulation, the NAIC insurance data security model law, the EU’s GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act and Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados—as well as numerous U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personal and confidential information, any of which may increase our compliance costs, expose us to fines, regulatory enforcement actions and reputational harm, and constrain our ability to mobilize and deploy information-technology-based resources in support of our business strategies.

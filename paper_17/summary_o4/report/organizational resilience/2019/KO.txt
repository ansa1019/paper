The report makes clear that the company relies extensively on networks and information systems—including the internet and third-party hosted services—to support procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collections, employee processes, consumer marketing, mergers and acquisitions, research and development, financial reporting and global electronic communications among company personnel, bottlers, customers, suppliers and consumers. Because these information systems are critical to many operating activities, system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches—from routine operations, user errors, network or hardware failures, malicious software, cyberattacks, geopolitical events or natural disasters—could disrupt operations, delay financial reporting, impair manufacturing, distribution, invoicing or collections and result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential or regulated personal data. To address these risks, the company continues to invest in IT personnel, technologies, cyber-insurance and training; maintains an information risk management program supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee; and prepares regular reports on emerging risks and mitigation strategies for senior management and the audit committee. In the ordinary course of business, the company receives, processes, transmits and stores personal data subject to U.S. federal, state and foreign privacy laws such as the GDPR and CCPA, requiring robust data governance, security systems, policies and procedures to prevent improper disclosure and comply with changing requirements. The company further recognizes that its future success depends on adapting to and thriving in the digital environment and has made digitizing the Coca-Cola system a top priority by creating more personalized digital consumer experiences, developing digital tools and capabilities for retail customers and digitizing operations through data analytics, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to enhance efficiency and productivity. Finally, reliance on third-party service providers, cloud data hosting and other external technology partners introduces comparable cybersecurity, privacy, business interruption and system-failure risks, and the company’s policies, procedures and training programs may not fully ensure compliance across its extended ecosystem.

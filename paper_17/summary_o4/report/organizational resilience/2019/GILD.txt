The annual report underscores the firm’s reliance on information technology systems, infrastructure and data—exemplified by its Kite Konnect platform for ensuring chain of identity and custody of Yescarta—while warning that the multitude and complexity of its computer systems render them inherently vulnerable to service interruptions, malicious intrusions and random attack, and that data privacy or security breaches could expose sensitive intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information to unauthorized parties, resulting in financial, legal, business or reputational harm. It further notes that cyberattacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, threatening the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, and cautions that its insurance may not sufficiently cover losses from information security incidents. The company also acknowledges the growing burden of evolving global data privacy and security regulations—such as the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA—which impose substantial new compliance requirements and monetary fines, potentially increasing the cost of providing products and services or preventing offerings in certain jurisdictions. In addition, management highlights challenges in information management and forecasting—such as accurately predicting product demand, fluctuations in wholesaler inventories and government rebate claims—which depend on complex data collection from major wholesalers under inventory management agreements and can cause material variance in revenue forecasts. Finally, the report emphasizes that laws governing healthcare fraud, rebate and price reporting require robust information processing capacity and accurate methodologies, and that disputes over reported calculations could necessitate restatements and expose the company to additional financial and legal liability.

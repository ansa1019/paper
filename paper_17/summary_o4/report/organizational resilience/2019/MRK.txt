Merck is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems and computing infrastructure (collectively, IT systems) to conduct critical operations; certain of these systems are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties to assist in conducting the company’s business. Disruption, degradation or manipulation of these IT systems through intentional or accidental means by the company’s employees, third parties with authorized access or unauthorized third parties could adversely affect key business processes, and cyber-attacks against the company’s IT systems or third-party providers’ IT systems, such as cloud-based systems, could result in exposure of confidential information, modification of critical data and/or the failure of critical operations, as demonstrated by the 2017 network cyber-attack that disrupted worldwide manufacturing, research and sales operations. Misuse of any of these IT systems could result in the disclosure of sensitive personal information or the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property or other confidential business information. The company continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes; the use of which can create new risks. In response, Merck has implemented a variety of measures to further enhance and modernize its systems to guard against similar attacks in the future and is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to enhance its resiliency, not only to protect against future cyber-attacks but also to improve the speed of recovery and enable continued business operations to the greatest extent possible during any recovery period. Although the aggregate impact of cyber-attacks and network disruptions on the company’s operations and financial condition has not been material to date, Merck continues to be a target of events of this nature and expects them to continue, and therefore monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of company IT systems on an ongoing basis to reduce these risks. Beyond risk management, the company’s Animal Health segment offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products and its Healthcare Services segment provides services and solutions focused on engagement, health analytics and clinical services to improve the value of care delivered to patients, reflecting an expanded digital infrastructure and analytics capability supporting organizational goals, market responsiveness and operational efficiency.

The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our reduced-risk products, and we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, consumers, customers and others, some of which are managed by third-party service providers. We have backup systems and business continuity plans in place and take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access; nevertheless, failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them, or our failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations, could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, place us at a competitive disadvantage and cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands. Failure to protect personal data, respect the rights of data subjects and adhere to strict cybersecurity protocols could subject us to substantial fines and other legal challenges under regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and as we are increasingly relying on digital platforms in our business, the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase.

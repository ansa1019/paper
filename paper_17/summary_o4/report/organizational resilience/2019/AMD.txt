In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets and those of our business partners and third-party providers to support our internal business processes and key business functions, and we rely on a number of internal business processes and information systems that must be sufficiently scalable and continually evolve through consolidation, standardization, mobility and cloud-based solutions to meet our changing business needs; modification, interruption or outage of these systems, whether due to cyber-attacks, viruses, malware, data breaches, power anomalies, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, could disrupt operations, compromise our intellectual property or confidential data, divert management and IT resources, and result in significant remediation, reputational harm and financial costs. We outsource certain supply-chain logistics and product distribution functions and engage third-party providers for IT support—encompassing help desk support, desktop and business application services, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access—which, in an increasingly distributed IT environment, can complicate visibility, control and administrative requirements. We anticipate ongoing investments in enhancing and implementing security controls, upgrading network and computer security components, training workers, remediating breaches, addressing litigation, mitigating reputational harm and complying with external regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and failure to prevent unauthorized access, data loss or system outages could materially adversely affect our competitive position, financial condition and operational effectiveness.

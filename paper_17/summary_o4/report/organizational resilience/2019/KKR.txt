KKR’s operations are heavily dependent on integrated information systems and data‐processing platforms that support the time‐sensitive, efficient and accurate execution, confirmation and settlement of transactions across global markets, as well as financial, accounting and operational reporting, recordkeeping and compliance functions. These systems, including third‐party hosted solutions and electronic communications networks, underpin the valuation, monitoring and administration of funds and portfolio assets and facilitate coordination of internal processes, interfirm relationships and strategic decision‐making. The firm acknowledges that limitations in scalability, suitability for new products and strategies, security vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, data breaches, cyberattacks, vendor disruptions or infrastructure failures—including those affecting its primary offices—could impair operational flexibility, process efficiency, information accuracy, confidentiality and overall resilience. Business continuation, disaster recovery and data governance programs are maintained, but may not fully mitigate the risks of system outages or cyber‐security incidents. Regulatory scrutiny of data privacy and cyber risks has intensified demands for robust information governance, monitoring systems and controls. As KKR pursues new investment strategies, it faces challenges in ensuring that technology deployment and IT infrastructure align with evolving business needs and support operational innovation, value creation and competitive positioning. These considerations underscore the importance of mobilizing and leveraging technology resources in combination with other strategic capabilities to maintain market responsiveness, organizational agility and performance.

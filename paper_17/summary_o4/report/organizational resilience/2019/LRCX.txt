During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and other business components on a timely basis, and we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. We recognize that our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected by transportation, communication, demand, information technology, or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control, and that our outsource providers and component suppliers play a key role in functions including information technology, facilities management, and finance—any failure of which could adversely impact our operations. We rely on critical information systems—including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, computer hardware and software applications (some integrated into our products), network communications, email, and third-party SaaS products—for the effective operation of our business, and these systems are subject to cyber-security threats, breaches, failures or disruptions (whether from malicious actors, inadvertent actions, power failures or natural disasters) that could materially impair our ability to access confidential or sensitive data, disrupt manufacturing or customer processes, degrade product or service performance, and expose us to regulatory or litigation risks. We also acknowledge risks related to disruptions of our information technology resources at our primary manufacturing facilities and have invested in ISO 27001-compliant security procedures, intrusion prevention, identity and access controls, and recovery processes to mitigate these exposures.

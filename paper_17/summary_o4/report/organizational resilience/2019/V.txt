Visa’s core IT capability is reflected in its advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, which facilitates the authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and underpins a broad suite of products, platforms and value-added services for financial institution and merchant clients. As a global payments technology company, Visa works closely with third parties and fintech entrants, including digital wallet providers, to develop and integrate new technologies—ranging from mobile and proximity payment solutions, ecommerce, tokenization and push payments to non-card-based payment flows like B2B Connect, as well as emerging innovations in cryptocurrencies, biometrics, distributed ledger and blockchain—that expand its digital infrastructure, increase operational flexibility and drive business growth. Innovations in payment technology have enabled expansion into new offerings but also introduced expanded regulatory and licensing requirements, occasionally requiring Visa to make its technology or intellectual property available to third parties; notably, the EU’s requirement to separate scheme and processing has increased costs and impacted the execution of Visa’s innovation and product strategies. Visa recognizes that failure to anticipate, adapt to or keep pace with these rapid technological changes could harm its competitive positioning, intellectual property rights and future growth prospects, and accordingly devotes significant resources to cybersecurity and supplier risk management to protect its networks, systems and data against errors, service interruptions, malware, social engineering, advanced persistent threats and other security breaches.

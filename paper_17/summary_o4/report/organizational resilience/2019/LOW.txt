The annual report emphasizes that delivering an effective omni-channel experience depends on the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy and integrate customer-facing technology systems—including websites, mobile apps and back-office platforms—to provide data and functionality with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access, and to tailor these capabilities in response to changing customer preferences and business strategies. It highlights that success in adapting to evolving shopping habits requires large, complex programs demanding integrated planning, initiative prioritization, program sequencing and new competencies among management, employees and contractors, and underscores the need to attract, retain and manage a large number of skilled technology professionals to implement these strategic initiatives. The company acknowledges that its management information systems—which support core operations such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment—must be continually maintained, improved, upgraded and expanded to avoid serious disruption, data loss or erosion of customer confidence, and that investments in these systems may themselves introduce operational risk. The report further warns that cybersecurity incidents, system failures, infrastructure outages, computer viruses, malicious attacks, ransomware or human errors could compromise customer, employee, vendor and payment data, disrupt business operations, undermine regulatory compliance with evolving data privacy and payment card security laws, and materially impair customer relationships, reputation and financial results. It also notes reliance on third-party service providers for authentication, content delivery and other services, subject to similar security and operational risks, and recognizes that ongoing changes in privacy, cybersecurity and payment industry regulations may require increased costs to continually evaluate and adapt policies, processes and controls to protect information assets and support the firm’s strategic objectives.

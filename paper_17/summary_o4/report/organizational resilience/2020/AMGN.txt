In response to COVID-19, we have activated our applicable business continuity plans, including suspending U.S. in-person meetings and interactions with the healthcare community, halting most international and domestic travel, and transitioning most employees to remote work in order to “perform critical functions and maintain operations” despite pandemic-related restrictions; notwithstanding these measures, “disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including transportation and supply chains,” as well as health-related workforce restrictions, have “adversely affected, and continue to adversely affect, the efficiency of our business operations” and may further “interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation.” We rely on “sophisticated information technology systems, including software, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems” for our R&D, manufacturing and commercial activities and “continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems,” yet acknowledge that “a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data.” Our commercial manufacturing is concentrated in Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California, and we “perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities” and heavily depend on sole-source third-party suppliers for key raw materials and devices, exposing us to risks from capacity constraints, contamination, regulatory non-compliance, natural disasters, power failures and cyber incidents; recognizing that “alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis, or at all,” we continually assess and mitigate these vulnerabilities through diversified sourcing, enhanced business continuity measures and ongoing review of our supply chains to preserve system integrity, maintain operations under internal or external pressures, and position the organization to adapt and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

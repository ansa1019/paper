In response to the global outbreak of COVID-19, we have aligned our operations with local government guidance and social distancing recommendations by transitioning the majority of our employees globally to remote working, supported by our technology infrastructure and disaster recovery and business continuity programs designed to preserve organizational functioning under challenging conditions. We draw upon multiple sources of liquidity—including bond issuances, a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, operating cash flow, net realizations and performance allocations—to ensure rapid resource allocation and financial resilience amid market volatility and uneven economic recoveries. Recognizing heightened cybersecurity and operational risks in a remote environment, we maintain layered defenses against phishing, social engineering and hacking attempts, monitor the performance of third-party administrators, cloud-based services and critical business partners, and continually stress-test our systems to mitigate disruptions to fund administration and communications platforms. Our emergency management framework provides for the preservation of core services at our New York headquarters, redundant operations and adaptive work arrangements, thereby enabling us to sustain organizational health, positive adjustment and performance through internal and external pressures, unexpected events and prolonged disruptions.

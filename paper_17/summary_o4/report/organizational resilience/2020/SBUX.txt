Our disclosures describe how the organization has absorbed strain and adapted its operations under extreme conditions, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which “severely impacted our results” through temporary closures and “modified operations” ranging from drive-thru and delivery only to full store shutdowns, and how, as conditions evolved, “we gradually reopened our stores and, since then, have seen sequential improvements in comparable store sales in both our Americas and international segments as transaction volumes continue to climb, reflecting the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand.” We further detailed our “plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense, metropolitan markets, by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences,” including the closure of approximately 100 stores in Q4 FY2020 and the planned wind-down of an additional 700 stores over 18 months, with related restructuring and impairment charges recognized as those assets are reconfigured. In international markets, we noted that “company-operated stores in the China market began re-opening in the fiscal second quarter, and nearly all company-operated stores were open by the end of the fiscal third quarter,” and that “to support our international licensees in their recovery efforts, we extended more flexible development and financial terms, including waiving royalty payments during the fiscal third quarter.” Throughout the second half of FY2020, “we experienced initial business recovery as our stores gradually reopened under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving customer behaviors and expectations,” with “our global business recovering steadily, with China approaching comparable store sales recovery and the U.S. demonstrating continued upward momentum in sales and profitability,” and “our channel development segment continues to grow category share as customers adjust to their at-home routines.” We emphasize ongoing investments in “technologies and innovations to elevate the customer and partner experience and to drive long-term growth,” and explain that “by reimagining our store formats, we are moving swiftly to adapt to new customer behaviors.” Absent further public-health relapses or economic disruptions, and “based on the current trend of our retail business recovery and our focused efforts to expand contactless customer experiences, digital capabilities and beverage innovation,” we believe “we are well positioned to regain the positive business momentum we had demonstrated prior to the pandemic.” In support of financial stability and continuity, we described qualifying for CARES Act payroll tax credits, deferrals of payroll tax payments and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy to partially offset lost revenues and incremental costs; our significant investments in “technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss”; and our reliance on incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans to address “interruptions in our operations” caused by power outages, catastrophic events, system failures or cyber-attacks. We also highlighted risks and mitigation strategies associated with supply-chain interruptions—“any material interruption in our supply chain … could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability”—and described ongoing efforts to secure “qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner,” as well as the challenges of “effectively managing growth … as we expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards.”

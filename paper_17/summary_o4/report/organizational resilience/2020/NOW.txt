The Covid-19 pandemic “disrupted the flow of the economy and put unprecedented strains on governments, health care systems, educational institutions, businesses and individuals around the world,” prompting the company to temporarily close most offices, shift to remote working, implement travel restrictions and convert in-person events to virtual experiences to maintain business continuity. Management deemed it “advisable to continue” these measures “for the immediate future,” adapting approaches by geography according to health protocols, while acknowledging that re-opening efforts “may not be successful,” could expose employees to health risks and involve additional costs or liability. To support organizational health and future orientation, the company reported focusing on “maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business,” and in 2020 released emergency response applications and a Safe Workplace suite and dashboard “designed to help companies manage the essential steps for returning employees to the workplace and to support their health and safety.” The risk disclosures further note that natural disasters, “pandemics such as Covid-19,” terrorism, political unrest and other catastrophic events may interrupt operations despite “crisis management and disaster response plans,” potentially making it “difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services” and adversely affecting operational continuity. The company devotes “significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures,” but warns that ongoing cyber-security threats may require “significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure,” reflecting its risk mitigation and adaptability capabilities. It also emphasizes reliance on a network of partners for service delivery, noting that partner failures could constrain distribution and harm operating results, and underscores the continuous updating of compliance and risk management programs to address actions by employees, agents or third parties that could impair performance. Management cautions that “changing laws, regulations and standards” on data privacy, cross-border transfers and cloud computing could restrict its ability to process customer data, necessitating operational adjustments or additional resource allocations, and stresses the importance of “successfully continu[ing] to release new products and updates to existing products,” as delays or defects could reduce adoption, impair service delivery and hinder its ability to preserve or improve functioning under adversity.

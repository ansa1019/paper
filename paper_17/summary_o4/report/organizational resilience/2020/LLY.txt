In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken a series of measures to preserve or improve the functioning of our operations under challenging conditions, including maintaining a reliable supply of our medicines, reducing strain on the medical system, protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees—particularly those at manufacturing sites and distribution facilities—and supporting our communities to ensure affordability of and access to our products; in certain outbreak locations, we temporarily halted in-person interactions by our employees with healthcare providers, increased virtual interactions, and continue to adapt in-person engagement as it is safe and compliant with applicable guidance. We paused new clinical trial starts and patient enrollment early in the pandemic to alleviate pressure on healthcare resources, subsequently resuming these activities as conditions permitted while monitoring for delays or unexpected issues that could affect the timing, conduct, or regulatory review of our trials. To mitigate risks to our global supply chain and distribution systems, we have implemented measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent vulnerabilities in our information technology infrastructure—ranging from system inadequacies to cyber-attacks—and continue to enhance the resiliency of our IT systems, supplementing these efforts with cyber liability insurance and risk-management programs that include derivative instruments to hedge interest-rate and foreign-currency exposures. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources—including cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term borrowings, and our committed credit facilities—to ensure sufficient funding for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, debt obligations, pension and retiree health contributions, and potential business development activities, while monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers, suppliers, and partners. Our reliance on third-party partnerships for clinical trial management, manufacturing, distribution, and IT support is managed through oversight of contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, privacy, and security obligations to preserve continuity of critical services. In anticipation of changes in the external environment—such as economic downturns, trade disruptions, regulatory reforms, and competitive pressures on pricing and access—we maintain patient affordability programs, adapt our contracting and rebate strategies, and engage in ongoing scenario analysis to safeguard our financial position and ability to develop, launch, and distribute innovative therapies.

Nike’s risk factors section addresses internal and external pressures such as health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks—including the COVID-19 pandemic—which have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns and significant disruption in global markets, reduced consumer demand, supply-chain interruptions, increased freight and logistics costs and volatility in global financial markets. The company states it continues to monitor developments regarding the pandemic and has made assumptions in its operating, financial and tax planning but is unable to accurately predict pandemic impacts, which may lead to higher inventory levels, revised payment terms with wholesale customers, higher sales-related reserves, factory cancellation costs and a volatile effective tax rate. In response to COVID-19 uncertainty, Nike enhanced its liquidity position during the fourth quarter by issuing $6 billion in senior unsecured notes, suspending its share repurchase program and entering into a new $2 billion committed credit facility. Nike relies on extensive information-technology systems and networks across its supply chain, digital commerce platforms and global operations and invests in system integration, security enhancements, business continuity planning and disaster-recovery capabilities, while maintaining business interruption insurance to mitigate potential service interruptions from cyber-attacks, system failures, natural disasters or vendor disruptions. Through its foreign-exchange risk management program, the company uses standard rates and derivative instruments to manage transactional and translational exposures, applies a factory-currency exposure index to product costs, and hedges net investments in foreign subsidiaries to minimize translation volatility. Operational strategies for demand sensing, inventory management and digital fulfillment include shifting product offer dates, increasing digital-fulfillment capacity, modifying buying plans and targeted markdowns to accelerate liquidation of excess inventory and protect franchise health. Policies covering contingent liabilities, indemnifications, contractual reserves for sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims, as well as endorsement contract structures for guaranteed and performance-based payments, support flexible resource reallocation and risk mitigation. These practices demonstrate Nike’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions through proactive planning, adaptive financial measures, robust risk-management mechanisms and dynamic operational reconfiguration.

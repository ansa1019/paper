Berkshire’s risk disclosures emphasize the company’s efforts to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions by maintaining business continuity planning, disaster-recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate operational interruptions from cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or other disruptive events. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our operating businesses implemented comprehensive continuity plans—temporarily closing nonessential facilities, expanding work-from-home policies, staggering shifts, enhancing sanitation protocols, conducting health screenings, eliminating noncritical travel and meetings—and undertook resource-preservation measures such as employee furloughs, temporary wage and salary reductions, capital-spending cuts and liquidity-conservation actions. Certain subsidiaries initiated restructuring activities to realign capacity with expected demand, and our unusually decentralized model, which relies on qualified management at individual operating units, supports rapid adaptation and resource allocation across diverse business lines. As an essential carrier, BNSF continued service throughout pandemic-related disruptions, recovering volumes through productivity improvements, cost-control initiatives and ample liquidity to maintain operational flexibility. Overall, these practices reflect a systemic perspective on resilience—combining risk assessment, reconfiguring operations, strategic resource deployment and decentralized decision-making—to maintain integrity and performance under challenging and evolving conditions.

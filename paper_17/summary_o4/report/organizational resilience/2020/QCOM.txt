In response to the rapid, global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and its attendant economic uncertainty, we implemented remote-work protocols for the vast majority of our workforce, adjusted business continuity plans to preserve our manufacturing, supply chain and shipping operations, and assessed supplier capacity and alternate sources to mitigate the risk of component or raw-material shortages. Although to date we have not experienced a significant negative impact to our results of operations, we continue to monitor government-imposed measures—such as travel bans, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and trade restrictions—and evaluate our vulnerability to employee illness, order delays or cancellations, customer or supplier insolvencies and shifts in consumer demand that could disrupt revenues, cash flows and financial condition. We have also maintained prudent liquidity management through a diversified mix of cash, marketable securities, debt financing, dividend payments and share repurchases, while investing heavily in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and strategic supply agreements to sustain and grow our business long-term. Concurrently, we devote substantial resources to cybersecurity defenses, regulatory and compliance initiatives, and risk assessment processes to safeguard our intellectual property, ensure operational flexibility in the face of antitrust, tax and trade policy changes, and preserve organizational integrity under both nominal and extreme external pressures.

Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could significantly and negatively affect our business operations, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, prospects, reputation or credit ratings now and in the future, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline significantly, illustrating exposure to unexpected situations and the need for risk mitigation. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting how we operate our business. Although we currently do not anticipate any disruption to the supply of our medicines to patients due to COVID-19, it is possible that we could experience manufacturing or supply issues due to COVID-19 in the future, which would increase the negative impact on our business and results of operations, reflecting potential supply chain fragmentation and resource constraints. For instance, we are experiencing and may continue to experience scarcity of certain raw materials and components as a result of the influx of COVID-19 vaccine orders receiving priority treatment from vendors. If a natural disaster or other potentially disruptive event occurs on top of the current pandemic, it could deplete our safety stock levels and we could experience a manufacturing, supply or distribution issue, acknowledging hazards and interruptions. We have plans to mitigate this impact, but if we are not able to fully mitigate it, the breadth of our future pipeline opportunities could be adversely affected, evidencing resilience strategies and resource reconfiguration. We have implemented a number of measures to protect the health and safety of our workforce, including, where needed, a mandatory work-from-home policy for our global workforce who can perform their jobs from home as well as restrictions on business travel, and workplace and in-person meetings, demonstrating operational flexibility and adaptation; if we determine that it is no longer safe to engage in these in-person interactions, we will likely return to a remote model of engagement, and this transition could have a negative impact on our business. Although we have restarted clinical development activities, we continue to experience delays in the initiation and enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, and we may not be able to fully mitigate these delays, which could negatively impact the timing of our pipeline development programs and expected future revenues and/or cash flows, underscoring resource reallocation and risk assessment. We cannot predict or reasonably estimate the impact of any potential long-term changes to the healthcare industry from COVID-19, which could exacerbate any of the other risks described in this Form 10-K, reflecting uncertainty and environmental perturbations. Our product supply and related patient access has been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted by difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products, including disruption in supply chain continuity, such as from natural disasters, global disease outbreaks, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, indicating external pressures and business continuity risks. We have limited experience manufacturing CAR T cell therapies, and logistical and shipment delays and other factors not in our control could prevent or delay the delivery of our product candidates to patients, pointing to organizational capabilities and complexity. The integration of our operations following the Celgene acquisition is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and if we are unable to successfully combine the businesses in an efficient, cost-effective manner within the anticipated timeframe, the projected benefits and cost savings may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected and our business may be unable to grow as planned, which could materially impact our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations as well as adversely impact our share price, highlighting change management and strategic adaptation challenges. The failure of any critical third party to meet its contractual, regulatory and other obligations could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results, emphasizing inter-organizational collaboration and resilience. We rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed by third parties, to assist in conducting our business; a significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure could negatively impact operations, and although we have invested in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices, there can be no assurance that our continuing efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches to our or our third-party providersâ€™ databases or systems that could adversely affect our business, reflecting cybersecurity preparedness and risk mitigation. Failure to execute our business strategy could adversely impact our growth and profitability, and if we are unable to support and grow our marketed products, successfully execute the launches of newly approved products, advance our late-stage pipeline, manage change from our operating model evolution or manage our costs effectively, our operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted, illustrating the importance of strategic resilience, operational flexibility and future orientation. Furthermore, adverse changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions could adversely affect our profitability, underscoring exposure to environmental turbulence and external disturbances, and our disclosures collectively describe a multifaceted organizational response to disruption, emphasizing mitigation measures, operational flexibility, resource allocation strategies and the potential impacts on performance maintenance and continuity under challenging conditions.

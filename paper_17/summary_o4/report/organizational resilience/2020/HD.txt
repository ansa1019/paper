The Company acknowledges that its business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which “may impair our business operations” and hinder its ability to preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions. It cites “strong competition” in a highly fragmented industry as external pressures that could force rapid reconfiguration of resource deployment and operational flexibility to maintain competitive advantage. The Company discloses that “the implementation of initiatives to build one supply chain and create the one Home Depot experience could disrupt our operations in the near term” and warns that failure to “choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations.” It states that disruptions in its supply chain or logistics network – stemming from natural disasters, pandemics (including governmental shutdowns and re‐openings), labor strikes, or trade policy changes – “could impair our ability to meet customer demand,” requiring adaptation and reconstituting of delivery trajectories. The report highlights the necessity of contingency measures such as backup credit facilities, diversified payment methods and hedging instruments to mitigate financial risks and maintain system integrity under extreme conditions. It emphasizes that “disruptions in our customer‐facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy,” while “a failure of a key information technology system or process” could “significantly disrupt our operations or impair data security,” underscoring the critical role of information resilience and cybersecurity. The Company also details actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic – adjusting store hours, limiting store capacity, instituting curbside pickup, expanding digital platforms, and enhancing associate pay and benefits – as immediate reconfigurations of its operating trajectory under exceptional conditions. It notes that these and future strategic investments in supply chain, digital assets, and store environments are designed to absorb strain, ensure business continuity, and preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions, while acknowledging that insufficient implementation or resource management “could adversely impact our competitive position and financial condition.”

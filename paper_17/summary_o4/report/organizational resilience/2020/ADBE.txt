Adobe’s disclosures emphasize that its ability to maintain performance under challenging conditions depends on its capacity to manage and adapt to a range of internal and external disruptions.  The company acknowledges that the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures have “materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses,” necessitated global office closures, travel restrictions and a work-from-home operating environment that has “caused strain for, and may adversely impact the productivity of, certain employees,” and that efforts “to re-open our offices safely may not be successful” and could involve additional financial burdens.  In response, Adobe has shifted in-person customer, employee and industry events to virtual-only formats, which “may not be as successful” and may require further alterations or cancellations.  The firm notes that measures such as physical distancing, travel bans and shutdowns have led to regional and worldwide slowdowns or shutdowns, delayed provisioning of offerings, extended payment terms, reduced subscription duration and increased attrition, underscoring that “if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.”  Adobe’s hosted services depend on data centers managed by Adobe and third parties, and the company concedes it “does not have redundancy for all of our systems” and that its “disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities,” such that system interruptions, unexpected transitions among data centers or failures in hardware, software or network capacity could disrupt service delivery, incur liabilities, violate service-level commitments, trigger regulatory notifications and damage reputation.  The company devotes “significant resources to address security vulnerabilities” yet admits that “these security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated” and that actual or perceived breaches may lead to legal claims, loss of customers and reputational harm.  Adobe also highlights the risk of catastrophic events—earthquakes near its headquarters, wildfires causing power shut-offs, floods, cyber-attacks or other weather events—any of which “could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data,” potentially exacerbated by simultaneous events like a pandemic.  The company further recognizes that climate-related risks such as drought, wildfires and infrastructure disruption could “disrupt our business” and impose “additional costs to maintain or resume operations,” and it has aligned with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board to assess and proactively address these risks.  More broadly, Adobe underscores that its long-term success and ability to sustain integrity and performance under pressures—from competitive dynamics and regulatory changes to economic volatility—depends on anticipating disruptive change, allocating resources effectively, making sustained investments in technology, security and people, and adapting its business model and operations to preserve continuity, resilience and firm performance.

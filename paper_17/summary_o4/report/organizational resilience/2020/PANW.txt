In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19 and various government restrictions and guidelines, the Company has taken measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus and minimize the risk to its workforce, channel partners, end-customers and the communities in which it operates, including transitioning employees to remote work beginning in March 2020, reprioritizing engineering and research and development efforts and adjusting related policies as new public health guidance becomes available.  Recognizing that its business and operations have experienced significant growth and increased complexity, management continues to improve and expand the Company’s information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls and its ability to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner.  The Company’s reliance on manufacturing partners for hardware assembly and global supply chains for key components reduces direct control over quality assurance, product costs, timing and transportation, exposes it to manufacturing and logistics delays, pricing fluctuations and capacity shortages, and may require the redesign of products or qualification of alternate suppliers if components are unavailable.  Managing supply and inventory levels is complex, since insufficient supply can delay revenue or cause lost sales opportunities and excess inventory can harm gross margins.  The Company and its third-party service providers face ongoing security threats, ranging from malicious code and employee misuse to sophisticated nation-state intrusions, and, despite efforts to build security barriers and review third-party code, it acknowledges that it cannot entirely mitigate these risks.  To maintain its competitive position and ensure operational continuity under challenging conditions, the Company invests in continuous product and service innovation, timely development of new features and strategic acquisitions, and expands global customer support capacity, and believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its anticipated liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.

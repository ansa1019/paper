In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply shortages; many retail stores and channel partner points of sale were temporarily closed or reopened subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers; the company required substantially all of its employees to work remotely and continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities; the full extent of the impact of the pandemic on the companyâ€™s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on factors including timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, development and availability of treatments and vaccines, and compliance with protective public safety measures; the company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers and has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, which can require substantial investment while not assuring return; the company records write-downs for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand and accrues cancellation fee reserves for excess products and components to mitigate risks of obsolescence; manufacturing purchase obligations cover forecasted requirements and the company acknowledges the risk of forecasting incorrectly in volatile and rapidly changing markets, which could affect inventory positioning; the company relies on single-source or limited-source suppliers and outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia for manufacturing and logistics, which lowers operating costs but reduces direct control and may adversely affect flexibility to respond to changing conditions; outages or failures of information technology systems or networks could be disruptive and system redundancy and business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities, potentially preventing access to online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding manufacturing and shipping; losses or unauthorized access to confidential information including personally identifiable information could materially adversely affect the company and while measures such as encryption are in place and services and systems are monitored for unusual activity, these measures may not provide absolute security; compliance with complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide may require changes to the company's supply chain and business practices and increase costs; political events, international trade disputes, natural disasters, public health issues and other interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and require the company to change suppliers, restructure business relationships and cease offering certain applications, actions that may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and distracting; many operations and facilities are in locations prone to natural disasters, and interruptions could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture and deliver products, create delays and inefficiencies in the supply chain and service outages, and following an interruption the company could require substantial recovery time, significant expenditures to resume operations and suffer lost sales; the company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, although such coverage may be insufficient; global and regional economic conditions, competitive pressures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect demand, supply chain stability, pricing and margins; the company employs risk management practices including hedging, recording liabilities for anticipated legal and other contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable, deferring revenue for bundled services and future unspecified software upgrades based on estimated stand-alone selling prices, and assessing the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and warranties based on estimates of future product demand, and these policies require management judgment and are subject to change if facts and circumstances evolve.

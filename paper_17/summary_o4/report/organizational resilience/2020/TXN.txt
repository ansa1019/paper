The Company acknowledges the inherent uncertainty and external pressures posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that it has modified, and may further modify, its business practices in response to pandemic-related government, supplier, customer and societal actions and economic and social ramifications across its global markets. It has long maintained a business continuity plan for unforeseeable situations and, over the past several years, has invested in building inventory and expanding its global, internally owned manufacturing footprint to enable the ability to build products across multiple manufacturing sites, thereby improving operational flexibility and mitigating supply-chain disruptions, although such investments may not fully eliminate them. The Company’s reliance on third-party suppliers exposes it to supply constraints, quality excursions, natural events, health epidemics and credit market instability, any of which could limit access to key raw materials, utilities and technology, underscoring its need for risk assessment and mitigation strategies. From time to time, strategic, business and organizational changes—including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions—are undertaken to support its objectives and strengthen its four sustainable competitive advantages, comprising its manufacturing and technology foundation, broad analog and embedded processing portfolio, market channel reach and product diversity, which collectively contribute to its capacity for positive adjustment and performance maintenance under challenging conditions. The Company emphasizes disciplined capital allocation, makes significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and develop new products, and continuously monitors and assesses evolving factors such as the duration and scope of external disruptions and changes in customer demand to inform resource deployment, ensure liquidity from operating cash flows and short-term investments, and sustain dividend and debt obligations. This multifaceted approach to operational management, strategic foresight and resource reconfiguration reflects its commitment to preserve or improve functioning amid internal and external disturbances and to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

Oracle discloses that it “is conducting business as usual with modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of certain marketing events, among other modifications,” and that it “will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and stockholders,” reflecting its capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning under the adverse conditions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. It acknowledges that “the duration and extent to which [the pandemic] will impact our future results of operations and our overall financial performance remains uncertain” and that “if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed,” underscoring the imperative of rapid adaptation and risk mitigation. The company further characterizes its operating environment as one of “rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict,” and emphasizes its strategic response through diversified deployment models—cloud, on-premise and hybrid—to deliver choice and flexibility to customers, thereby enhancing operational continuity and resilience. In its hardware business, Oracle warns that its “supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest, public health crises such as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, changes to trade policies, port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns,” noting that such disruptions “could materially and adversely affect” its ability to deliver products. It identifies public health crises, regulatory uncertainties including data-privacy laws, global economic and political volatility such as Brexit and trade policy shifts, and cybersecurity threats as external pressures requiring continuous monitoring, contingency planning, and agile reconfiguration of resources. Through ongoing investments in cloud services and license support infrastructure, active risk assessment, and a flexible go-to-market strategy, Oracle endeavors to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, foresee and confront sudden disruptive change, and preserve or improve performance despite the presence of adversity.

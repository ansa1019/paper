Charles Schwab’s 10-K describes a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework encompassing risk identification and assessment, measurement, monitoring and mitigation controls overseen by a global risk committee and functional subcommittees in areas such as operational, compliance, credit, market, liquidity and new-product risks. The firm maintains systems and procedures—including routine risk and control self-assessments, internal and external audit reviews, and information security and fraud prevention programs—to detect, respond to, and recover from operational failures, cyber-attacks, security breaches or other internal or external events that could impair continuity of its technology platforms, trade processing and client services. Business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities are supported by backup communications facilities, a geographically dispersed workforce, incident management protocols and regular testing of continuity plans. Liquidity and capital contingency plans, stress testing of cash flows and regulatory capital, recovery strategies for extreme or stressed scenarios, and liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios are used to ensure the company can absorb sudden deposit fluctuations, market shocks or credit events while preserving integrity of its balance sheet and sustaining service. Schwab also manages credit exposure through collateralized lending, margin and secured-loan policies, and maintains diversification of funding sources, including internal cash generation, external credit lines and repurchase agreements, as well as proactive monitoring of counterparty and concentration risks. These practices, together with structured governance and oversight, aim to preserve operational flexibility, resource allocation effectiveness and the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

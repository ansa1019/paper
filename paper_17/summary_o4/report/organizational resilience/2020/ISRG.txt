Our filings describe a broad recognition that our ability to maintain continuity of operations and positive adjustment under challenging conditions hinges on preparing for and responding to a variety of internal and external disturbances. We acknowledge that “natural disasters or other events beyond our control” such as earthquakes, wildfires, government shutdowns, funding shortages, border trade restrictions, and global pandemics—including the extensive business disruptions, restrictions on travel, facility closures, and supply-chain interruptions experienced during the COVID-19 outbreak—can materially affect production, distribution, sales and service; accordingly, we have increased raw-material inventories, invested in manufacturing and automation, and evaluated single- and sole-source supplier alternatives to enhance operational flexibility. To mitigate information-system hazards and cyber-security threats, we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, user authentication protocols, periodic audits of both our systems and those of key third-party vendors, and ongoing improvements to our incident-detection and response programs to preserve system integrity, business intelligence, and organizational learning. In managing credit and lease financing risks, we monitor customer financial health, employ leasing and usage-based arrangements to align resource deployment with utilization, and offer relief programs—including service-fee credits, deferred payments, and extended receivables terms—to support healthcare providers’ operational resilience and supply continuity. We maintain robust global quality systems and compliance programs in anticipation of evolving regulatory standards—ranging from FDA premarket review reforms and medical device single audits to the EU’s GDPR, CCPA, and new privacy directives—and regularly re-evaluate our procedures, training, labeling, and corrective-and-preventive actions to adapt to changing requirements without significant disruption to our ability to develop, manufacture, or commercialize products. Our financial resilience rests on scenario-based forecasting, dynamic capital planning, and remeasurement of deferred tax assets, legal contingencies, and intangible-asset recoverability, underpinned by a liquidity position of $6.9 billion in cash, equivalents, and investments, which we believe will enable us to absorb strain, redeploy resources, and sustain performance even under extreme conditions, thereby preserving our organizational health, strategic agility, and capacity for positive adjustment in the face of adversity.

The company’s disclosures describe multiple practices and resource allocations that support business continuity and adaptability under internal and external pressures: they “committed significant capital and resources for clinical trials and the scale-up of the production of remdesivir” to address pandemic-driven demand surges; maintain “good manufacturing practices” and conduct “routine inspections” to guard against production interruptions; rely on diversified “third-party manufacturers and corporate partners” and “independent third-party contract research organizations” for critical inputs while acknowledging potential “disruptions” and “difficulties” that could require costly “remediation efforts” or alternate sourcing; employ “foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge” exposure to market volatility; and sustain liquidity through revolving credit facilities and senior note issuances to ensure funding for operations, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases despite fluctuating cash flows. They monitor “supply chain” risks, evaluate “operational resources” amid “epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases,” adjust “clinical trial timelines” and “manufacturing scale” under “shelter-in-place” and travel restrictions, implement “health screenings and covid-19 testing” and “flexible work” arrangements to protect employees, and dynamically assess “accounts receivable” and “working capital” in response to “inventory channel” fluctuations. In regulatory and legal domains, they maintain comprehensive compliance programs, anti-bribery controls, and recognize potential “civil and criminal sanctions,” while recording liabilities for “uncertain tax positions” and “legal proceedings” to anticipate and mitigate adverse financial impacts. Through strategic collaborations, acquisitions, and “purchases of equity securities and other investments,” Gilead diversifies its portfolio, allocates resources to “in-process research and development,” and integrates new capabilities to maintain performance and adapt to “disruptive events” in a turbulent pharmaceutical environment.

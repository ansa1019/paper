To comply with shelter-in-place orders and safeguard its workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company closed all of its offices except for essential personnel in certain locations and transitioned the vast majority of employees to work from home, while directing its contract manufacturers in Malaysia, Mexico and the United States—each experiencing shelter-in-place orders, workforce disruptions and production delays—to increase buffer inventories of components with extended lead times in order to ensure adequate supply and mitigate the risk of future excess and obsolete inventory; as a result of these manufacturing disruptions and logistic challenges, lead times and supply chain costs increased, adversely impacting gross margins, prompting the Company to fund additional working capital, enter into non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments and establish reserves for excess and obsolete component inventory to preserve operational continuity. Amid rapidly evolving external pressures including supply shortages, tariff risks and geopolitical constraints, the Company has continued to allocate resources to research and development, expanding capabilities of its cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and scale its global support organization in order to sustain service innovation and maintain performance, while its disciplined forecasting process for inventory requirements, contract manufacturer liabilities and strategic sourcing of merchant silicon seeks to absorb strain and preserve functioning. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements and growth strategies for at least the next twelve months, reflecting an ongoing focus on risk mitigation, resource deployment, adaptation to internal and external variations and the maintenance of system integrity under challenging conditions.

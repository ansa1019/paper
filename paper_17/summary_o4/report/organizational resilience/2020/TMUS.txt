Throughout the year, as a critical communications infrastructure provider, we have focused on providing crucial connectivity to our customers and impacted communities while ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees by implementing remote working arrangements for corporate and care employees, supplementing pay and commissions for affected staff, opening, closing and limiting capacity of retail stores in compliance with evolving local and state mandates, and continuously monitoring the pandemic’s impact and adjusting our actions as needed to maintain service continuity. We have taken additional temporary steps to keep customers connected, including waiving late fees, committing to the FCC’s Keep Americans Connected pledge, working with Lifeline partners to deliver free data, providing unlimited high-speed smartphone data and hotspot allowances, and partnering with spectrum holders and the FCC to double our 600 MHz LTE capacity through June 2020. We rely on systems and networks—both our own and those of third parties—and continuously evaluate and revise our safeguards against threats from human error, cyber-attacks, data breaches, supplier failures, severe weather, natural disasters, public health crises, terrorist attacks, political instability and other disruptions to prevent unauthorized use or interference, preserve network integrity and protect customer information. To grow and remain competitive, we continually invest in our network—acquiring and deploying spectrum, building out 5G infrastructure, enhancing capacity and service offerings—while managing extensive five-year build-out commitments to government agencies and must fulfill time-sensitive obligations without diverting undue management attention from other operations. Our integration of Sprint and T-Mobile operations involves structured initiatives to achieve efficiencies in network, retail, IT and back office processes, support workforce alignment through severance and re-branding efforts, and decommission redundant small cells and DAS sites, all of which demand organizational agility and risk mitigation to realize anticipated synergies and maintain operational flexibility. We depend heavily on suppliers, service providers and subcontractors for network components, software development, billing and customer service support, and our business could be severely disrupted by supplier non-performance, delays, transition challenges or the need to replace services on short notice, underscoring the importance of inter-organizational collaboration, risk assessment and contingency planning. Continuous adaptation to macro-economic, regulatory and competitive pressures, including economic downturns, changes in spectrum availability, technology transitions, and legal or compliance actions, remains essential to absorbing strain from adverse conditions, preserving or improving functioning, and maintaining our integrity and performance despite internal or external variations and disturbances.

Chubb’s disclosures emphasize maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a combination of underwriting controls, risk modeling, reinsurance, geographic diversification and contingency planning. The company attempts to manage exposure to natural and man-made disasters—including hurricanes, floods, pandemics, terrorism and cyber-attacks—by using a disciplined underwriting process, establishing per-occurrence and aggregate limits, securing third-party reinsurance and retrocessional protection, capping program size, and continuously adjusting case reserves and incurred but not reported reserves as new information becomes available. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chubb implemented remote work arrangements supported by enhanced IT capacity and contingency plans, continued business operations effectively in the face of unpredictable telecommunications infrastructure, and acknowledged the potential for extended disruptions. Liquidity management is supported by high-quality, short-duration fixed income investments, cash balances, credit facilities, repurchase agreements and duration-matching of assets to liabilities to meet unforeseen claim demands. The company regularly monitors and stress-tests catastrophe accumulations, employs analytical models for underwriting, claims reserving and catastrophe risk while recognizing that actual results may diverge from model outputs, and maintains a high degree of judgment in estimating loss liabilities. Financial flexibility is further enhanced through periodic access to capital markets under shelf registrations, maintenance of strong financial strength and credit ratings, and compliance with covenants under letter-of-credit facilities. These measures—underwriting discipline, risk transfer structures, reserve adequacy reviews, liquidity and capital management, operational continuity planning and dynamic exposure analysis—reflect systemic strategies to preserve or improve functioning under internal or external pressures, adapt to rapidly changing conditions and maintain integrity and performance across Chubb’s global operations.

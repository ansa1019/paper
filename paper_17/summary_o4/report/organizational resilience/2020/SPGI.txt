The annual report describes a comprehensive business continuity program that has enabled nearly the entire employee population to continue operations remotely since mid-March 2020, including the diversion of information technology resources to establish and maintain a sustained remote working environment and the regular assessment and improvement of disaster recovery plans and key management succession, all designed to preserve functioning despite external pressures such as the COVID-19 pandemic and to mitigate operational risks. It details scenario planning to assess and analyze the impact of evolving economic conditions, actions taken (including rating actions and index composition revisions) in response to volatile markets, and publishing research to forecast and confront uncertainty, reflecting a systemic perspective and a future orientation toward adaptation and resilience. The company has invested in cybersecurity measures and acknowledges increased vulnerability to cyber threats in its remote environment, emphasizing risk assessment, prevention, and potential recovery mechanisms. In the context of the pending merger, it notes contractual restrictions and potential delays as constraints on resource allocation and strategic initiatives, requiring reconfiguration of trajectories, coordination of geographically separate organizations and consolidation of infrastructures to maintain performance and realize synergies under challenging conditions. The report also highlights the reliance on third-party service providers for critical functions—outsourcing of technology, cloud infrastructure and data feeds—which introduces risks to system integrity and necessitates contingency planning, and underscores ongoing compliance and risk management efforts across multiple regulatory regimes to sustain organizational health and capacity to absorb strain, preserve integrity, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

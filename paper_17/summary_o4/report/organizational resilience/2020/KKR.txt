While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful, and we monitor developments relating to the global spread of COVID-19 and continue to assess the potential for adverse impact on our business, implementing initiatives such as remote working arrangements while also seeking to maintain business continuity. Operational risks may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth, as we rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems and on third-party service providers, any failure, disabling or interruption of which—including inadequate business continuation or disaster recovery programs—could cause financial loss, liability, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Cyber-security failures and data security breaches may have a material adverse impact on our operations, investments and reputation, and while we take protective measures, the precautions we and our vendors employ may not be effective in all cases or fully insured. In addition, material external changes such as Brexit may adversely affect our ability to source investments or provide services, and the transition away from LIBOR and other benchmark reference rates may increase our costs or adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

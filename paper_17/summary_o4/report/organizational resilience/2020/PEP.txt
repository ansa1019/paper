Throughout the Form 10-K, the Company describes a range of policies and practices that support its capacity to absorb strain and maintain functioning under challenging or disruptive conditions, including the development and continual refinement of “business continuity plans and crisis management protocols” to protect the health of associates and to “ensure continuity in manufacturing, distribution and sales” in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic; the securing of its supply chain through contingency planning for “temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners” and for “shortages or discontinuation of raw materials,” as well as investments in “expanded benefits and frontline incentives, the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation”; the strengthening of “e-commerce and digital capabilities” and “information technology infrastructure” to enable remote working and mitigate cyber incidents; the use of an “integrated risk management framework” and “risk committees” at corporate, divisional and country levels to identify, assess and address top strategic, financial, operational, compliance and safety risks; “productivity initiatives” that “simplify, harmonize and automate processes,” re-engineer go-to-market and IT systems, optimize the manufacturing and supply chain footprint and drive “operational flexibility”; the emerging focus on becoming “faster, stronger and better” through “holistic cost management,” reinvestment in “advantaged capabilities” and an “agile and flexible end-to-end value chain”; the continual enhancement of crisis response, such as “health and safety protocols” and “disaster recovery” measures; strategic initiatives to “diversify our workforce” and reinforce a culture in which “employees act like owners” to foster organizational health; the creation of joint ventures and service alliances that bolster inter-organizational collaboration; and the deployment of financial tools—such as layered credit facilities, commercial paper, hedging arrangements and supply-chain financing programs—to preserve liquidity and maintain access to global capital markets.

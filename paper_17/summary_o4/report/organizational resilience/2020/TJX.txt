The report details the company’s operational responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary closures of stores, online businesses, distribution centers and offices under governmental travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and quarantining protocols, while continuing to incur labor, occupancy and benefits costs for associates and negotiating rent deferrals and extended payment terms on merchandise orders to preserve liquidity. It describes the implementation of new health and safety practices—enhanced cleaning protocols, occupancy limitations, personal protective equipment and social distancing measures—guided by global task force teams to ensure operational continuity. The company emphasizes its “opportunistic buying strategy,” which relies on lean inventory levels, frequent inventory turns and discretionary sourcing by merchants who assess shifting opportunities and trends, and underscores the need to flexibly allocate and deliver merchandise, adjust store floor space and revalue inventories through markdowns in response to unanticipated demand changes. Supply-chain interruptions—from supplier disruptions to transportation and logistics constraints—have prompted additional operational adjustments, and the company routinely employs derivative instruments to hedge transportation and currency-exchange risks. The report also highlights challenges in managing a large, geographically dispersed workforce during furloughs and remote working, addressing recruitment, training and retention under health and economic pressures, as well as investments in information technology integrity, disaster recovery plans and cybersecurity defenses to maintain critical business processes. Liquidity management actions include the issuance and refinancing of debt, expansion of revolving credit facilities, suspension of share repurchases, cautious capital-expenditure planning and selective impairment assessments of store assets and inventory write-downs triggered by reduced sales projections. These disclosures collectively illustrate the company’s ability to absorb strain, preserve integrity and maintain performance under disruptive internal and external conditions through adaptive processes, resource reconfiguration and risk mitigation strategies.

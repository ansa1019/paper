Lockheed Martin describes how it “took measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, work with our customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions and support our community” under the global covid-19 pandemic, including “equipping employees with personal protective equipment, establishing minimum staffing and social distancing policies, sanitizing workspaces more frequently, adopting alternate work schedules” and implementing “a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can meet our customer commitments remotely,” measures to “sustain production and related services” while minimizing transmission risks. The company “proactively monitor[s] our supply chain” and “implemented multiple actions to help mitigate the effects of covid-19, including accelerating payments to suppliers” after the Department of Defense increased progress payment rates, and “used the accelerated progress payments from the U.S. government plus cash on hand to accelerate $2.1 billion of payments to our suppliers” for future-due amounts. Lockheed Martin maintains “a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities,” preserves “access to credit markets for liquidity or general corporate purposes,” and employs payment mechanisms such as “performance-based payments, progress payments, and cost-reimbursable contracts” to align billing with incurred costs. The corporation emphasizes long-term contract structures that “generally allow for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin,” while maintaining overseas operations as a “critical infrastructure workforce” to deliver essential national security products. To manage market risks, Lockheed Martin uses foreign currency and interest rate derivatives and “contracts under federal acquisition regulations” to mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. These strategies and practices enable Lockheed Martin to maintain operations and performance under varying internal and external pressures, demonstrating “positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

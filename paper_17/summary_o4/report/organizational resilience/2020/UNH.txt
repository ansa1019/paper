UnitedHealth Group states that “we have mobilized the full strength of our resources to deliver the best care for patients, support for our members and care provider partners, keep our employees safe and deliver innovative solutions and support for the communities we serve and the entire health system,” noting that the “ongoing COVID-19 global health crisis continues to have major impacts on health systems, businesses, governments and customer and consumer activities” and that “although we cannot predict the pacing, intensity and duration of COVID-19, the pandemic’s disruption to business activities, employment and economic effects, and near and long-term impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system could continue to have material and adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.” The company explains it “manages medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs,” and that deviation from effective estimation, pricing and management “could decline and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.” UnitedHealth further emphasizes that “our business is highly dependent on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use … to operate our business,” that “our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences,” and that “failure to protect, consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy.” It warns that “further disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including supply chains providing medical supplies and pharmaceutical products, could adversely disrupt our business operations or increase our operating costs,” and that “the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations … and increase the risk of shortages of necessary items.” With respect to regulatory and market challenges, UnitedHealth notes that “the broad latitude given to the agencies administering, interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations … could force us to change how we do business, restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our … capital requirements, or expose us to increased liability,” while on financial and liquidity management the firm reports that “we continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility,” that “we believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs,” and that any “downgrades in our credit ratings could materially increase our costs of or ability to access funds.”

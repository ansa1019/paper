Accenture has implemented a comprehensive plan to enable approximately 95% of its global workforce to work remotely in response to governmental directives and recommended safety measures, thereby preserving operational continuity and the delivery of services to clients. The company proactively plans and manages workforce size and composition—through hiring, reskilling, compensation adjustments, targeted involuntary terminations and utilization monitoring—to align resource deployment with evolving client demand and sustain margins. Leveraging a global delivery model concentrated in India and the Philippines, Accenture seeks to deploy talent worldwide while maintaining alliances with key technology providers to drive continuous innovation in digital, cloud and security offerings. The firm maintains business continuity and disaster recovery plans, regularly assesses risks from pandemics, travel restrictions, natural disasters, cyberattacks and geopolitical instability, and recognizes the potential for disruptions in communications, travel and access to facilities. Accenture employs flexible contract structures with variable consideration and incentive fees, measures project progress using cost-to-completion estimates, and uses currency protection provisions and hedging programs to mitigate foreign exchange volatility. With sufficient cash reserves, borrowing capacity and disciplined cost-management strategies—including pricing and resource reconfiguration—the company continually assesses operating and financial risks through internal audits and scenario planning, enabling it to absorb strain, adapt to adverse and unpredictable conditions, and maintain positive adjustment and performance under pressure.

The company’s disclosures emphasize its structured business continuity and disaster recovery frameworks, warning that failures to recover from natural disasters, pandemics, regional shutdowns or cyberattacks could lead to material financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability. It describes pandemic-related adaptations—transitioning substantially all colleagues to a remote work environment, restricting travel, implementing social-distancing plans and cancelling physical events—as essential modifications to its operating model that have materially increased economic uncertainty and required ongoing adjustments to business continuity plans. The company notes its reliance on a large network of third-party vendors and IT providers, underscoring that disruptions in vendor performance, systems failures or supply-chain attacks could impair service delivery, and it highlights efforts to continually update and patch complex information and safety control systems. It discloses regular assessments and enhancements of business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession, while acknowledging increased cybersecurity risks—including phishing and advanced persistent threats—resulting from extended remote work accommodations. To support operational flexibility and resilience, the company details investments in technology infrastructure, strategic initiatives to respond to digital disruption, maintenance of credit facilities and access to capital markets to ensure financing, and pension funding strategies to preserve financial stability. It further outlines systematic risk mitigation through regulatory and legal compliance programs (including GDPR and CCPA), information systems resilience measures, and cultural initiatives aimed at fostering colleague integrity, adaptability and crisis preparedness. Together, these statements describe an organizational approach to absorb strain, maintain integrity and preserve or improve functioning under nominal, extreme or exceptional internal and external pressures.

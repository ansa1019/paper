Danaher’s risk disclosures recognize that its operations are exposed to “general risks and uncertainties … such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws, regulations or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns including epidemics, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions,” and acknowledge that “public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19 … have led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities.” In response, Danaher reports that “our businesses have activated their business continuity plans,” have “modified certain of their respective business practices (including in many cases with respect to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and will likely take such further actions as may be required by government authorities or as determined to be in the best interests of our employees, customers and other business partners,” including “work[ing] with our suppliers to understand the existing and potential future negative impacts to our supply chain and take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts.” The company underscores that its “geographic and industry diversity … help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results” and that it is “making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources … to be responsive to the company's customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company's operations.” Danaher further highlights “productivity improvement initiatives,” “return-to-work protocols designed to help ensure the health and safety of its employees, customers and business partners,” and robust liquidity management—stating it “continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions and investments, paying interest and servicing debt, funding restructuring activities and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis.” These disclosures reflect the organization’s capacity to assess and reconfigure resources, adapt operational practices, mitigate risks across its supply chains and maintain performance amid extreme and unexpected conditions.

In response to the broad range of internal and external pressures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, global economic volatility and evolving security threats, the Company has undertaken a series of organizational resilience measures designed to maintain continuity of operations and preserve performance under exceptional conditions. These include substantial investments in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans; indexed fuel surcharges and hedging transactions to mitigate the impact of volatile energy prices; deployment of an innovation-driven “customer first, people led” strategy that accelerated enhancements to the U.S. ground network—improving time-in-transit and digital access for e-commerce platforms—and scaled capacity surcharges and charter flights in response to reduced air cargo capacity; strategic reconfiguration of the portfolio, including the planned divestiture of UPS Freight, to focus resources on core, high-value businesses and improve return on invested capital; ongoing refinement of non-GAAP financial measures to support forward-looking decision making; dynamic management of liquidity through cash from operations, commercial paper programs and committed credit facilities; and proactive adaptation of employee‐benefit funding, collective bargaining strategies and self-insurance reserves to address labor, health and pension risks. Taken together, these initiatives reflect a systemic, multifaceted approach to absorbing strain, redeploying resources, reconfiguring operational trajectories and sustaining organizational integrity and functioning under turbulent and often unforeseen conditions.

Our disclosure describes multiple processes and investments that support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the preservation of our integrity and performance despite internal or external disturbances. We maintain a robust program of information security and controls, invest significant resources to enhance our security posture, and retain business continuity and disaster recovery plans, including frequent testing, to recover critical business functions, assets and data in the event of operational failures or disruptions caused by hardware or software defects, cyberattacks, natural disasters, pandemics, power losses or other unforeseen events. We require specific business continuity and disaster recovery measures for our payments solutions, engage in scenario planning and remote-work protocols, deploy personal protective equipment and facility safety protocols, disinfect workspaces, suspend non-essential travel and visitors, and adapt existing policies as government authorities recommend to ensure operational continuity and employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. We monitor and manage interdependencies with global financial system participants and third-party service providers, maintain contingency arrangements under receivables financing and vendor contracts to mitigate the impact of supplier failures or credit losses, and retain significant cash, revolving credit and securitization facilities to preserve financial flexibility, service debt obligations and fund capital expenditures. We anticipate and respond to technological and regulatory changes—such as evolving industry standards for tokenization, data privacy regulations, cybersecurity directives and capital requirements—through disciplined capital allocation, enhanced controls, contract term renegotiations and ongoing compliance efforts. These measures collectively reflect our ability to absorb strain, deploy resources, reconfigure trajectories in response to disruptive events and preserve or enhance functioning to sustain competitive advantage and organizational resilience.

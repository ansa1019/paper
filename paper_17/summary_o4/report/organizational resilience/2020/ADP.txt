We have established and maintain comprehensive disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures and other disruptions, and in March 2020 implemented our business continuity plan to shift over 98% of our workforce to work-from-home or off-site locations to ensure uninterrupted service to our clients. We continually upgrade, enhance and expand our technology, solutions and services and devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes, including programs and processes to prevent, detect and respond to data or cybersecurity incidents, even as threat techniques evolve and may be difficult to anticipate. We safeguard and protect personal and business information and client funds through investments in highly liquid, investment-grade securities, laddering maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds out to five and ten years and employing short-term financing arrangements, including a $9.7 billion commercial paper program, reverse repurchase agreements and committed credit facilities, to satisfy funding requirements under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. Our strong, cash-generative business model, low capital intensity, robust free cash flow and disciplined risk management—reflected in reinsurance arrangements under ADP Indemnity—enable us to absorb downturns, comply with changing laws and regulations, support client needs through legislative updates and unexpected events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, reconfigure our operations via broad-based transformation initiatives (including workforce optimization, procurement transformation and digital implementation), and remain steadfast in reinvestment, strategic agility and long-term commitments to associates, clients, shareholders and other stakeholders.

We disclose that our ability to sustain core operations and preserve performance under evolving pressures—from regulatory initiatives and tax changes to economic volatility, geopolitical unrest, natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic—depends on comprehensive risk mitigation and adaptive measures, including business continuity plans and backup systems designed to support our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution networks, although these safeguards may not fully mitigate all impacts. We continue transforming our organizational design and talent alignment to respond with operational flexibility to shifting consumer preferences and regulatory requirements and to drive our strategic agenda of replacing cigarettes with smoke-free products, leveraging multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation to innovate and meet rigorous standards. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers and service providers enhances efficiency but entails diminished direct control and may require resource reconfiguration should we need to replace these arrangements. We operate across multiple segments and geographies, apply rigorous control and compliance procedures to manage legal, financial and cyber-security risks, and advocate for science-based regulatory frameworks for our reduced-risk products, reflecting a systemic, future-oriented approach to maintaining organizational coherence, resilience and performance under challenging conditions.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the United States and international economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown; in response, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented, and may continue to implement, numerous measures to contain the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. A significant number of our global suppliers, vendors, distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic and those operations have been, and could continue to be, materially affected by restrictive government measures, which has at times rendered some of our distributors and indirect channels unable to distribute our products or provide required services. Any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or delay in delivering our products may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all, which could harm our reputation, future sales and profitability. To the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by the pandemic and are not available to perform their job duties, we could experience delays in, or the suspension of, our manufacturing operations, research and product development activities, regulatory work streams, clinical development programs and other important commercial functions; moreover, the actions we take to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on our workforce could reduce the efficiency of our operations or prove insufficient. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted and continues to shift or as may be mandated by governmental authorities. Unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand timely, which could adversely affect our customer relationships and result in negative publicity. In an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical and other supplies and products in response to the pandemic, governments may require us to allocate manufacturing capacity in a way that adversely affects our regular operations, results in differential treatment of customers and/or adversely affects our reputation and customer relationships, and it is also possible that certain of our operations are deemed non-essential and thus subject to suspension or other restrictions by government orders. We rely on indirect distribution channels to market, distribute and sell our products, and our ability to market, distribute and sell our products through indirect channels has been adversely affected as a result of precautionary responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions, suspension and shutdown orders and other measures intended to limit person-to-person contact. We develop, manufacture and distribute our products globally and our global operations are subject to risks and potential costs, including disruptions of transportation due to a global pandemic of contagious diseases like COVID-19, such as reduced availability of transportation, port closures, increased border controls or closures, increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain. We invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions; the risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses, diversion of management time that could adversely affect management’s ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel, litigation resulting from the acquisition and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies. We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business; numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and product offerings, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, and a security breach could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. We are in the process of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning system, and any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive workforce in our highly competitive industry, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives; in addition, if we are unable to maintain an inclusive culture that aligns our diverse workforce with our mission and values, this could adversely impact our ability to recruit, hire, develop and retain key talent. We and our suppliers have manufacturing sites all over the world; damage to our facilities, to our suppliers’ or service providers’ facilities, or to our central distribution centers as a result of natural disasters or otherwise, as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation, equipment breakdown or malfunction, environmental hazard incidents or changes to environmental regulations or other factors, could adversely affect the availability of our products, and in the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand, which could result in lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals, and we may experience loss of market share, additional expense and harm to our reputation. We use a variety of raw materials, components, devices and third-party services in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes; if sole-source suppliers or service providers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials or services, we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer. We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates despite the COVID-19 pandemic; we anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations, commercial paper, existing credit lines and capital expenditure and operating expense reductions, and we maintain a revolving credit facility with $1.5 billion of committed capital which expires in August 2023 and a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2021, and we continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.

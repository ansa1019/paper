Union Pacific’s annual report describes a broad array of measures reflecting its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, consistent with the definition of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company manages fluctuating demand for services and network capacity by continuously improving its transportation plan, adding capacity, enhancing yard and terminal processes, and reallocating resources to address surges in demand, while acknowledging that these measures may not fully mitigate service shortcomings. In response to significant volume swings during the COVID-19 pandemic, Union Pacific adjusted demand-driven resources to maintain minimal customer disruptions, and its operational transformation produced record velocity improvements and an all-time best operating ratio. To mitigate operational risks, the company employs a multi-faceted safety approach—including technology, risk assessments, training, data monitoring, and an operating practices command center—to identify and resolve mainline service interruptions; it invests in positive train control, hardens its infrastructure against severe weather and natural phenomena, and devotes significant resources to cybersecurity defenses through continuous evaluation of attacker techniques, monitoring, training, and prevention. Financial resilience is supported by diversified liquidity sources—cash, a receivables securitization facility, a revolving credit facility, and commercial paper—alongside strategic capital investments, share repurchases, and ongoing monitoring of asset service lives, depreciation rates, pension and postretirement benefit assumptions, and environmental liabilities to maintain fiscal integrity. The company prepares for supply-chain and regulatory disruptions—such as trade interruptions, labor disputes, climate-related policy changes, key supplier failures, and the transition away from LIBOR—by renegotiating contracts, adjusting pricing structures and fuel surcharge programs, converting truck traffic to rail to bolster competitive positioning, and maintaining flexible capital plans and contingency commitments, thereby enhancing its system resilience, operational flexibility, and ability to transform and emerge stronger under pressure.

Visa’s compliance programs and policies are designed to support our adherence to a wide array of regulations and laws, such as anti-money laundering, anti-corruption, competition, privacy and sanctions, and we continually enhance these programs as requirements evolve; however, if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings, services, fees and other aspects of our business. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we modified our business practices—restricting employee travel, closing offices, having employees work remotely, cancelling events, scaling back hiring, lowering marketing spend and reducing operating expenses—and we continue to take actions as required by authorities or in the best interests of our employees, clients and partners in order to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We maintain approximately $7.7 billion of available liquidity globally in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities, and our treasury policies are designed to provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures, liquidity contingency scenarios and timely settlement of payment obligations; we also have an unsecured revolving credit facility, commercial-paper program and, in fiscal 2020, issued $7.3 billion of senior notes to support capital needs. We indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses caused by counterparties’ failure to fund their obligations in accordance with Visa operating rules, with indemnification limited to unsettled transaction amounts and partially managed through collateral requirements, retrospective responsibility plans and an escrow account. To mitigate operational risk, we invest in the resilience of our processing network, engage with third parties to manage supplier and partner performance, monitor cyber-attack attempts and data security incidents, and enhance our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities. Our strategic initiatives, including client incentive programs, partnerships, co-branding efforts, acquisitions and investments, seek to drive acceptance growth, promote network routing preference and improve system capabilities, even as we recognize that such undertakings carry execution risks—such as cultural and technological integration, regulatory approvals, litigation exposure and geopolitical uncertainties. These collective measures reflect our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve our integrity and performance despite internal and external variations and disturbances, embodying the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and positioning us to respond effectively to regulatory, competitive, public health and market disruptions.

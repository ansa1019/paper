To maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we modified our business practices by restricting employee travel, shifting employees to remote work and cancelling in-person meetings and events, and stand ready to implement further measures as required by authorities or to preserve employee, customer, partner and supplier operations. Government-imposed quarantines, travel bans and shelter-in-place orders disrupted our global manufacturing operations and facilities, and increased transportation restrictions—including reduced air transport availability and port closures—diminished our capacity to meet customer demand. We support business continuity through diversified manufacturing across internal facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia, and by leveraging third-party wafer foundries, assembly and test services to absorb facility disruptions, capacity constraints and supply chain interruptions. Our liquidity management framework, encompassing significant cash and cash equivalents, a $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with covenant-based borrowing capacity, and forward currency exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures, ensures operational flexibility and risk mitigation. In response to long-term strategic objectives, we executed workforce repositioning initiatives and consolidated select wafer and test facilities acquired through business combinations, actions that reallocate resources, yield anticipated annual cost savings and enhance organizational agility. Matters related to the proposed Maxim acquisition and integration planning have required substantial commitments of management time and resources and imposed pre-closing operational restrictions, which could affect our ability to pursue alternative strategic transactions. We periodically assess and test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment upon triggering events or through annual quantitative analyses—incorporating discounted cash flow and market-multiples approaches—to determine recoverability and maintain the integrity of our asset base under varying economic conditions. Additionally, the adoption of new accounting standards, such as ASC 842 on leases, reflects our commitment to updating our operational and financial processes to preserve functioning and performance in the face of internal and external pressures.

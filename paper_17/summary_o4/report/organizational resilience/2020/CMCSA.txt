During 2020, despite unprecedented operational disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive governmental measures, Comcast’s businesses demonstrated the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by ensuring network continuity and scalability, with its distribution network performing under the stress of increased traffic from remote work and learning and the company’s ongoing investment in scalable infrastructure, cloud-based DVR technology, the X1 and Sky Q platforms and the launch of the Peacock streaming service to respond to shifting consumer behaviors and intensified competition. The company proactively allocated human, technical and financial resources—including additional compensation for frontline personnel, waived fees, extended payment options and a free-service Internet Essentials offer—to mitigate customer connectivity risks, support cash flow and preserve core operations while implementing cost-savings initiatives, deferring noncritical capital projects and conservatively managing liquidity through strong operating cash flows, available credit facilities and strategic debt issuances. In parallel, Comcast maintained a systemic perspective on enterprise risk, actively monitoring vendor health, conducting rigorous impairment testing of goodwill and franchise rights, hedging currency exposure and structuring guarantees to reinforce financial flexibility. The development, maintenance and continual enhancement of extensive security programs, security architecture and monitoring processes further protected critical network and information systems from evolving cyber threats, process breakdowns and other disruptions, thereby preserving system integrity and organizational functionality even under extreme conditions.

Vertex has adopted a formal business continuity plan to address potential crises, including information technology system failures and site disruptions, and maintains security measures and contingency protocols to minimize interruptions to critical corporate functions. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the company continues to monitor local government guidance for each site, employs a phased, site-specific approach to assess essential employee access, and has implemented enhanced safety measures—mandatory remote work for non-essential personnel, on-site testing, increased cleaning and sanitation, provision of personal protective equipment and social-distancing protocols—to ensure uninterrupted operations under challenging conditions. To mitigate supply-chain vulnerabilities and preserve manufacturing performance amid external pressures, Vertex collaborates with third-party manufacturers and partners such as Crispr to establish multiple sources of raw materials and production processes at or shortly after product approval, thereby reducing reliance on single suppliers and enabling prompt identification of alternative manufacturers in the event of disruptions. The company’s corporate compliance program, together with robust processes, controls and training, is designed to identify, prevent and mitigate regulatory and data-privacy risks under evolving laws (including the GDPR and HIPAA), safeguarding organizational health and enabling adaptation to shifting legal and operational landscapes. Through proactive risk assessment, foreign-exchange hedging strategies and continuous oversight of collaborative relationships, Vertex seeks to absorb strain, reconstitute its trajectories toward future objectives and maintain positive adjustment in the face of adversity.

The company’s disclosures recognize that its forward-looking statements about business outlook, objectives and expectations are inherently uncertain and may become outdated, and it assumes no obligation to update them, reflecting a formal risk assessment approach that acknowledges events could differ materially from its expectations. In its discussion of risk factors, the company identifies significant factors that may adversely affect its business, operations and financial condition, including foreign currency fluctuations, exchange or pricing controls, localized volatility, political instability, labor market disruptions, sovereign risk, broad economic instability, tightened credit markets, shifts in trade policy, discriminatory tariff and quota actions, and the deterioration of economic relations between countries, any of which could impair demand, constrain customer and supplier financial health or otherwise impede business continuity. It emphasizes that disruptions in its global supply chain—arising from labor disputes, loss or impairment of manufacturing sites, information systems discontinuity, inability to procure raw materials, natural disasters, extreme weather events, acts of war or terrorism, disease outbreaks or other external factors—have interrupted product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on its operations, financial performance and cash flows. The company notes that its ability to manage cost fluctuations in commodities, labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare through pricing actions, cost-saving initiatives and sourcing decisions is critical to preserving margins, and that failure to innovate in products, marketing and operations or to protect and enforce intellectual property rights could compromise competitive advantage and impede organizational adaptation to changing consumer habits and technological advances. It observes that success depends on its capacity to respond to competitive pressures, emerging retail trends and evolving sales channels, to manage and maintain key customer relationships, and to protect brand reputation against product quality, safety or environmental concerns or adverse social media commentary. The company further acknowledges reliance on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, financial institutions and joint venture partners for critical functions, and it maintains policies and procedures to manage the financial, legal, reputational and operational risks of these inter-organizational relationships, recognizing that failures or substantial disruptions could impair its operations. It underscores the risk of material information security or operational technology incidents—including cyber-attacks, system failures, network outages or data integrity breaches—and the importance of effective business continuity plans and incident response mechanisms to sustain manufacturing, distribution, order fulfillment and cash processing under internal or external disturbances. The disclosures also highlight the need to manage uncertainties related to changing political conditions such as Brexit, rapidly evolving laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions, and potential tax law changes, any of which may increase compliance costs, alter operating environments and require continuous adjustment of organizational practices. The company identifies the successful management of acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, productivity and cost-saving programs, ongoing organizational change processes, leadership transitions and talent attraction and retention—particularly in key growth markets with limited skilled resources—as essential to maintaining operational flexibility and organizational health. In discussing the COVID-19 pandemic, the company details the operational, demand and supply challenges posed by disease outbreaks, including significant volatility or shifts in consumer demand, constrained workforce capacity, disruptions in manufacturing and distribution, third-party partner failures, and government-imposed closures or travel restrictions, and it describes measures such as safety protocols, cooperation with health authorities and diversified sourcing to safeguard employee well-being and preserve the integrity of its global operations under extreme conditions.

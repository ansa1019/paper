In response to government mandates, health care advisories and employee and vendor concerns, the company altered certain aspects of its operations, including having its workforce spend a significant amount of time working from home and materially curtailing international travel, while resuming productions and related operations in many parts of the world even as the pandemic continued to affect content production, illustrating the company’s ability to adapt its processes, reconfigure its operations and maintain continuity under evolving external pressures. The company will continue to actively monitor issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter its business operations—in content production and otherwise—as required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities or as determined to be in the best interests of its employees, customers, partners and stockholders, thereby preserving or improving its functioning despite adversity. To sustain performance under environmental disruptions, the company has built its own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) and utilizes third-party cloud computing services to scale its streaming service reliably, while scaling original content production by building out expertise in creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other disciplines, and managing and adjusting its business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and differing legal and regulatory environments. The company also continues to broaden relationships with existing partners and increase its capability to stream to new platforms and devices, implement systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect data against evolving cybersecurity threats, and maintain flexibility in marketing, payment processing and technology platforms so as to mitigate operational risks, manage resource allocation and preserve its integrity and performance, at least partially, under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

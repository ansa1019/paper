NVIDIA’s disclosures emphasize the need to maintain operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by scaling and adapting its supply chain to meet customer demand, acknowledging that “business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs” and that “any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.” The company recognizes risks from earthquakes, pandemics, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and other catastrophic events that could disrupt critical functions, and it has undertaken proactive measures such as placing non-cancellable inventory orders, securing component supply in advance, and maintaining significant balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities “sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements.” NVIDIA continuously evaluates its liquidity and capital resources, including access to external capital, to ensure financing of capital requirements beyond twelve months, and it has implemented remote work policies, travel restrictions and cancellation of physical events in response to the COVID-19 pandemic—measures designed to mitigate risks even as it acknowledges there is no certainty that they will be sufficient. To preserve performance and recover from adversity, the company invests heavily in research and development, maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns, implements reserves for inventory provisions, and pursues strategic initiatives such as expanding market-specific technologies and ecosystems, integrating acquisitions like Mellanox and the planned Arm transaction, and adapting corporate processes—all reflecting a systemic approach to risk mitigation, resource allocation, and resilience engineering under varying internal and external perturbations.

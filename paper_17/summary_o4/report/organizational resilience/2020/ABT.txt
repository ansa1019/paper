Abbott’s organizational resilience is evidenced by its continuous investment in information technology systems, data protection and external monitoring to reduce the risk of significant disruptions, and by the implementation of comprehensive business continuity plans that enabled critical manufacturing and diagnostic operations to remain operational under government‐imposed restrictions, with office‐based work conducted remotely, strict travel limits imposed and, as conditions allowed, phased rotational returns and safety measures to maintain employee well‐being. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott rapidly reconfigured its resources and mobilized cross-functional teams to develop, obtain emergency use authorizations for and scale up multiple laboratory-based and rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, supported by increased capital expenditures to build manufacturing capacity. The company’s financial resilience is underpinned by substantial liquidity sources—including unused revolving credit facilities and commercial paper capacity—alongside hedging programs to mitigate foreign exchange volatility and disciplined working capital management to address supply chain and receivables risks. Concurrently, Abbott continues to allocate resources to research and development, pursue regulatory pathways for emergent needs and integrate strategic acquisitions, thereby enabling the maintenance and enhancement of its operational flexibility and the preservation of performance under challenging and rapidly evolving conditions.

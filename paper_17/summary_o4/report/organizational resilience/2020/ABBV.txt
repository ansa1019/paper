AbbVie discloses that public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19 have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on its operations and financial condition, prompting the company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie’s employees), partner with global authorities to support experimental use of multiple AbbVie assets for COVID-19 treatment, donate $35 million to bolster healthcare capacity and critical equipment supplies, and monitor clinical trial sites locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees.  AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines, uses business interruption insurance to provide a degree of protection in the case of single‐source supplier failure, and evaluates sourcing alternatives under regulatory constraints to maintain operational continuity.  In connection with the acquisition of Allergan, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization, reallocate resources and realize more than $2 billion of annual cost synergies over a three-year period, while preserving capacity to advance its pipeline and support on-market brands.  The company monitors economic conditions, customer creditworthiness and government regulations and funding, establishes allowances for potential receivable losses, maintains a $4 billion revolving credit facility and carefully manages liquidity to fund short‐term and long‐term obligations.  These strategic initiatives, productivity and efficiency programs, and risk management measures reflect AbbVie’s efforts to absorb strain, adapt to internal and external pressures and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.

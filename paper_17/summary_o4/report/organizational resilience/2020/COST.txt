The Company discloses that disruptions in merchandise distribution, processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events may result in delays in production and delivery of merchandise, adversely affecting sales and member satisfaction and potentially necessitating suspension of operations in some or all locations. It emphasizes that the availability and performance of its information technology systems are vital to efficient operations, and that failures or disruptions from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, employee errors or catastrophic events could impair its ability to buy products, produce goods, move products to warehouses and sell to members. The Company is undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects and is making significant investments in enhancing its digital resiliency for business-critical systems to prevent disruption from such events, while acknowledging that failure or delay in execution of these initiatives could impair day-to-day operations, delay its ability to be resilient to disruptive events and erode its competitive position and financial condition. It further notes that natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events could damage properties, limit store operating hours, reduce workforce availability, disrupt IT systems and supply chains, delay transport of goods and diminish product availability. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has introduced highly unpredictable and volatile impacts on business operations, demand patterns, supply chain functioning, inventory management and fulfillment, prompting measures such as remote work requirements, increased compensation and sanitation costs, precautionary safety measures, alternate sourcing strategies and temporary adjustments to member services to minimize risk and preserve operations under challenging conditions. The Company also acknowledges cybersecurity threats—ranging from random attempts to coordinated, sophisticated attacks—and the increased attack surface resulting from remote-work infrastructure, all of which pose risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its data and systems, potentially leading to reputational damage, litigation, regulatory actions, system disruptions, unauthorized data release, data corruption and increased remediation costs. To mitigate financial exposure to these and other risks, the Company employs risk-management mechanisms including a captive insurance subsidiary and reinsurance programs to fund employee health care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage, vehicle liability, inventory loss and other exposures, while noting that actual claims and costs are inherently unpredictable and may materially differ from recorded liabilities. These disclosures illustrate the Company’s focus on maintaining system integrity, preserving performance under pressure, allocating resources toward business continuity, crisis response and emergency management, and adapting its operations and supply-chain capabilities to ensure positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

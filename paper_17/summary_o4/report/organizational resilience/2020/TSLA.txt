We may be impacted by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic, as government regulations and shifting social behaviors have limited or closed non-essential transportation, business activities and person-to-person interactions, and we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of 2020, while some of our suppliers and partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable and motivated production workforce and ongoing government cooperation, including for travel and visa allowances. We continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. We have previously experienced and may in the future experience launch and production ramp delays for new products and features; for example, unanticipated supplier issues led to delays during the ramp of Model X and we experienced challenges with a supplier and ramping full automation for certain processes. In order to be successful, we will need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design tolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China and Germany. We also frequently adjust our retail operations and product offerings in order to optimize our reach, costs, product line-up and customer experience, although there is no guarantee that such steps will be accepted by consumers accustomed to traditional sales strategies. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy products and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets, maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products and hire additional personnel, including skilled electricians to support the ramp of Solar Roof. Our suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or we may be unable to manage these components effectively, exposing us to multiple potential sources of component shortages and requiring us to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements. We may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims, which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming; our insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks. We will need to maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects, and we may be unable to effectively manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to our various financing programs. We face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions over which we have little control, and we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs, legal prohibitions or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products. We must manage risks relating to our information technology systems and the threat of intellectual property theft, data breaches and cyber-attacks, which require significant management time, support and cost and may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory or certify our financial results. Any disruption caused by union activities, natural disasters, wars, health epidemics or other events outside our control could delay or suspend our operations. Our business and future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and although our cash flows from operating activities in 2020 exceeded capital expenditures, we may need or want to raise additional funds through equity or debt securities or credit facilities to fund current or future projects, even if not required by our existing indebtedness. Furthermore, we may choose to adjust our capital and operating expenditures across segments in response to global trends; if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, we may correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to diversify returns on our uncommitted cash, including investments in alternative reserve assets such as digital assets, which may be subject to volatile market prices, impairment and unique risks of loss. Finally, we must manage ongoing obligations under our agreement with the research foundation for the State University of New York relating to Gigafactory New York, and any failure to meet applicable future obligations may result in material penalties, adjustments to our operations or other adverse consequences that could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.

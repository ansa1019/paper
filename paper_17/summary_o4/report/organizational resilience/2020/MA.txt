The company has implemented an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies to address service disruptions arising from technology malfunctions, third-party vendor failures or catastrophic events, thereby supporting business continuity. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures, operations were reconfigured through restrictions on employee travel, the expansion of remote work environments and ongoing monitoring of government actions to evaluate their evolving effects on workforce, customer activity and cross-border transaction volumes. To preserve system integrity and performance under internal and external variations, the firm devotes substantial resources to defending its interchange-rate practices, deploys a privacy-by-design and data-by-design approach across product development, hedges transactional currency exposures through foreign exchange derivative contracts and safeguards information security via cybersecurity and intelligence products, analytics and consulting offerings. Operating a multi-rail payments network, the company continually diversifies its integrated value-added services, invests in technological innovation in partnership with fintechs and digital players and allocates resources to regulatory compliance, anti-money laundering and sanctions programs. It manages credit and liquidity risk as guarantor of settlement obligations, adapts to rapid technological and competitive changes and strives to deliver differentiated products while mitigating legal, regulatory and operational risks to ensure adaptability, operational flexibility and competitive advantage across a turbulent business environment.

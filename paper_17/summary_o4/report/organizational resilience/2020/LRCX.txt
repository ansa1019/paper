Lam Research’s disclosures describe a range of measures and capabilities that align with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including the implementation of business continuity plans to sustain operations amid quarantines, travel bans and “stay at home” orders that have caused facility closures, production delays, capacity limitations and supply chain disruptions, the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply, and teleworking by a large proportion of the workforce. The Company also required modifications to business processes and the implementation of social distancing measures which necessitated changes to existing manufacturing processes, and it continuously reassesses strategic resource allocation choices to respond to variability in semiconductor capital investments, avoid both under- and over-scaling of infrastructure, workforce and supply chain, and align expenditures with anticipated revenue streams. To mitigate risks to operational continuity, Lam Research maintains ISO 27001-compliant security procedures, virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access controls and emergency recovery processes for its critical information systems, while emphasizing the ability of its executive officers and senior management to identify and respond effectively to evolving external pressures. Business continuity planning for its primary manufacturing facilities, the establishment of alternative sourcing arrangements, ongoing investments in research and development, and pursuit of joint development relationships collectively support its resilience strategy by ensuring the firm’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning, and adapt to environmental perturbations and disruptive events.

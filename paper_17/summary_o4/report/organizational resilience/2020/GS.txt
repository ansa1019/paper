Despite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our operations and the communities where we are located. Since activating our business continuity planning (BCP) strategy in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on safeguarding our employees and ensuring continuity of business operations for our clients by establishing protocols for workplace safety, adapting to remote-work arrangements and maintaining robust systems and infrastructure that have operated without disruption. We maintain a pre-funded liquidity buffer of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash, coupled with a diversified, long-dated funding profile, to meet contractual and contingent obligations in both normal and stressed conditions, informed by scenario analysis and stress-testing under severely adverse events. Our firmwide risk management process continuously monitors and limits exposures across liquidity, market, credit and operational domains, dynamically reconfiguring resources and deploying capital to preserve system integrity and performance while under internal or external variations and disturbances. These measures reflect a systemic perspective that emphasizes risk mitigation, adaptability and the partial maintenance of integrity and functioning in both nominal and exceptional conditions.

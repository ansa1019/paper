Throughout 2020, the company concentrated on “emerging stronger from this crisis” by accelerating its business strategy—focusing investments on a defined growth portfolio, streamlining an innovation pipeline that is scalable regionally and globally, refreshing its marketing approach to improve investment effectiveness and efficiency, and investing in new capabilities to capture shifts in consumer behavior that may endure beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.  Its stated priorities have been ensuring “the health and safety of our employees,” supporting communities, maintaining brand supply and product quality, serving customers across all channels as they adapt to shifting consumer demands, and positioning the system to emerge stronger when the crisis ends.  To preserve business continuity and adapt under adverse conditions, global and regional teams were deployed to monitor the evolving situation, recommend risk-mitigation actions, implement travel restrictions and social-distancing practices, require temperature checks and protective gear, and develop “systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes” to manage supply-chain challenges.  In late 2020, the company took strategic steps to “transform our organizational structure and to reallocate certain resources aimed at emerging stronger from the pandemic,” building “a networked global organization designed to combine the power of scale with the deep knowledge required to win locally,” optimizing a reduced portfolio of master brands, establishing a disciplined innovation framework, strengthening data-driven revenue-growth management, enhancing system collaboration and capturing supply-chain efficiencies, and evolving the organization through targeted capability investments.  The company also maintains a formal water risk-management program, a carbon-footprint reduction commitment and rigorous product-safety and quality standards as resilience engineering measures against environmental perturbations and regulatory pressures.  Simultaneously, it is digitizing the Coca-Cola system—creating personalized consumer experiences, equipping retail customers with digital tools, and digitizing operations via data, artificial intelligence and automation—to bolster strategic agility, crisis-response capabilities and organizational health under challenging conditions.

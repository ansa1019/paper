The company’s annual report acknowledges that “our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service” could materially and adversely affect operations; it warns that “the covid-19 pandemic … has caused business slowdowns or shutdowns … which have significantly impacted our business and results of operations,” has “increased demands on our technical infrastructure” and raised the risk of “interruptions in the availability or performance of our products” from natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or supply chain disruptions; it emphasizes dependence on third-party providers—“we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide”—and notes that we “may not be able to procure sufficient equipment or services from third parties … or may be required to procure … on unfavorable terms,” potentially degrading reliability, user experience, or revenue; in response to the pandemic we have “implemented product changes to maintain accessibility of our services, such as reducing the quality of video to reduce bandwidth usage,” reallocated resources to “privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives” that “make … product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly,” and shifted to “personnel working remotely,” which “limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact productivity”; the report describes design, manufacturing, and inventory risks—“we may experience supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain”—and anticipates that “any significant disruption in our service, including as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results”; it also discloses exposure to “litigation, inquiries, or investigations” that may impose “structural or behavioral remedies” or “require us to modify or cease existing business practices.” Together, these disclosures articulate how the company seeks to preserve its integrity and performance under internal and external variations and disturbances, reconfigure resources, adapt its operations, and implement continuity measures in the face of adversity—effectively reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

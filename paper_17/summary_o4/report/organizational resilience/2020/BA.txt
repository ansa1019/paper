In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding, the company disclosed a series of operational adaptations designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite severe external pressures: it temporarily suspended and then resumed production at key sites under enhanced health and safety protocols, implemented social-distancing and expanded cleaning procedures, adjusted production rates across its commercial programs and reduced the 787 rate to five per month while consolidating 787 assembly in South Carolina, and reduced the 737 MAX accounting quantity by 400 units, expensing $2.6 billion of abnormal production costs incurred at abnormally low rates. It continues to monitor federal, state and municipal health guidance, impose additional operational restrictions or suspend operations if required, and work with suppliers—many of which have also suspended operations—to mitigate supply-chain instability that threatens its ability to meet delivery schedules and customer commitments. Recognizing the pandemic’s adverse cash-flow impact, the company used $18.4 billion of operating cash in 2020, increased its borrowings to $63.6 billion and suspended dividends to preserve liquidity, maintains $9.5 billion of unused credit-facility capacity, issued $29.9 billion of fixed-rate notes and a two-year delayed-draw term loan, and began funding retirement plan contributions with equity instead of cash to conserve approximately $1 billion over 12 months. The company also reassessed its liability for customer concessions under the 737 MAX grounding, maintaining a $5.5 billion provision, and noted potential further reach-forward losses related to the 777X program, for which a $6.5 billion loss was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. As part of a five-pillar business transformation strategy—focusing on Infrastructure, Overhead and Organization, Portfolio and Investments, Supply Chain Health and Operational Excellence—the company is rationalizing facilities (targeting a 30 percent reduction in office space), rightsizing its workforce (recording severance for 26,000 roles), prioritizing core product and service portfolios (reducing R&D and capital expenditures by $1.3 billion in 2020), strengthening supplier financial and operational resilience, and driving productivity and quality enhancements, all in order to maintain continuity, reinforce its capacity to adapt to unexpected disruptions and emerge stronger from exceptional conditions.

PepsiCo’s 10-K discloses an integrated risk management framework—overseen by the Board and its Audit and Compensation Committees, supported by a senior risk committee, divisional risk committees, a centralized risk management office, internal audit and compliance functions—designed to identify, assess, prioritize and address strategic, operational, financial, compliance, safety and reputational risks.  It details business continuity and crisis-response planning against “business disruptions” such as natural disasters, political instability, pandemics, cyberattacks, supply-chain interruptions, labor disputes and other unexpected events and stresses the importance of “taking adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events” and deploying “additional resources to restore our operations.”  It describes multi-year, multi-faceted productivity initiatives and global operating model changes to “reduce costs and improve efficiencies,” optimize manufacturing, expand shared services and re-engineer go-to-market systems in order to maintain operational flexibility and fund innovation.  It also outlines market-risk hedging programs for commodity, foreign-exchange and interest-rate volatility, the maintenance of tier 1 commercial-paper access and strong free-cash-flow generation to safeguard liquidity, and it underscores cybersecurity resilience, regulatory and environmental compliance, and sustainability efforts—such as water-conservation and greenhouse-gas reduction—as critical means of preserving performance and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

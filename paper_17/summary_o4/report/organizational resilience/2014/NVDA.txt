In our annual report, we acknowledge that business disruptions—ranging from earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change—could harm our operations, lead to declines in revenue, require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations, and adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders, interrupt other critical functions and damage our reputation. We also recognize that system security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses despite our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges. Our dependence on third-party foundries and subcontractors to manufacture, assemble, test and package our products—and on third-party software development tools to design, simulate and verify new products—reduces our control over product quantity, quality, development, enhancement and delivery schedules, exposes us to supply constraints, potential yield problems that require cooperative resolution with our suppliers, and risk of missed design cycles, each of which could impair our ability to meet customer demand and maintain or improve functioning under adverse conditions. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, recognize a liability for rebates and sales return allowances, and charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down excess or obsolete inventory based on forecasts of customer demand, while sales of previously written-down inventory are reversed to revenue; these measures reflect a systemic approach to resource management, risk assessment and business continuity under evolving market and competitive pressures. Our management continually evaluates current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, records liabilities for potential tax contingencies and litigation, performs annual goodwill impairment tests using qualitative and quantitative assessments, measures cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value with charges for other-than-temporary impairments, and recognizes losses when collection of receivables is not reasonably assured—practices designed to preserve system integrity and financial resilience. We believe that existing cash balances, anticipated cash flows from operations and access to external sources of financing will be sufficient to meet our operating, acquisition, capital expenditure, share repurchase and dividend requirements for at least the next twelve months, yet we acknowledge that substantial indebtedness could limit our financial flexibility, constrain resource deployment and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. We have established share repurchase authorizations, a formal dividend policy and anti-takeover provisions to support strategic resilience, and our stock-based compensation programs including performance stock units align employee incentives with long-term corporate objectives. Finally, we emphasize that fluctuations in demand and market acceptance, competitive pressures, evolving industry standards, customer order timing, manufacturing capacity and yields, legal and regulatory requirements, accounting standards, macroeconomic events and other external disturbances could prevent us from achieving expected financial results, thereby necessitating proactive adaptation strategies, risk mitigation mechanisms and robust organizational practices to ensure the maintenance of positive adjustment and organizational health under challenging conditions.

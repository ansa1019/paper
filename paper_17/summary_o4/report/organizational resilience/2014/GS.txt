Goldman Sachs has established a comprehensive and formalized framework of measures, controls and committees designed to enable the firm to maintain its integrity and performance under challenging internal and external conditions, including a multilayered governance structure with a global business resilience committee, a firm-wide operational risk committee and dedicated divisional risk committees, supported by independent control functions in credit, market, liquidity and operational risk, and under the oversight of senior management and the board. Liquidity resilience is ensured through a policy of pre-funding estimated crisis cash and collateral needs with a pool of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets, dynamic asset-liability management to match anticipated funding requirements, and a detailed contingency funding plan to address both firm-specific and market-wide stress scenarios. Capital resilience is maintained through forward-looking capital planning and stress testing processes—incorporating internally developed severely adverse scenarios, CCAR and DFAST requirements—and a contingency capital plan for potential capital shortfalls, while a comprehensive balance sheet management process and diversified funding sources across tenors, products and geographies guard against liquidity and funding concentration risks. The firm’s market risk management process combines daily full valuation of positions, value-at-risk, sensitivity analyses and scenario-based stress tests, with strict exposure limits and model validation, whereas credit risk management relies on granular credit reviews, exposure limits by counterparty, industry and region, collateral agreements, netting arrangements and targeted stress tests, and operational risk management deploys extensive policies, incident capture, scenario analysis and internal audits to mitigate process, systems and people-related failures. These elements, along with business continuity, resolution and recovery planning and regular testing of operational and technology infrastructure, contribute to the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity.

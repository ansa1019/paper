The Company acknowledges that the industries it serves are volatile and difficult to predict and that maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions requires accurately forecasting demand and effectively managing resources and production capacity across all segments, even incurring unexpected costs to align operations; it further recognizes that during periods of increasing demand it must ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory, manage its supply chain, attract and retain qualified employees and control costs, while during downturns it must reduce costs, realign its cost structure with prevailing market conditions and sustain key personnel motivation. Management notes exposure to uncertain global economic and industry conditions that can delay orders, reduce backlog conversion and strain cash flows, mandating continuous risk assessment, prioritization and mitigation actions, including cost‚Äêreduction and restructuring initiatives. Operational flexibility is fostered through a distributed manufacturing model and regular reassessment of the size, capability and location of global infrastructure, supported by a multi-year program to transform business processes via enhanced enterprise resource planning systems while retaining legacy systems to ensure continuity during transitions. To guard against disruptions from natural disasters, political instability, pandemics or acts of war, the Company underscores the need for an effective business continuity plan and robust organizational structure, procedures and controls to manage geographically diverse operations and third-party providers, including outsourcing and relocation strategies designed to realize productivity improvements, assure quality, continuity of supply and protect intellectual property. The report also highlights the importance of attracting, retaining and motivating key employees, training successors following workforce reductions, safeguarding cybersecurity assets, maintaining access to financial resources and credit facilities, and adapting supply chain and inventory strategies to unexpected shifts in demand in order to preserve integrity and performance under adverse conditions.

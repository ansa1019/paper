Our 2014 disclosures underscore the company’s ability to absorb internal and external strains and preserve operational continuity in the face of diverse economic, political and environmental perturbations across global markets.  We outline our global risk exposures—ranging from staffing and management challenges in varied jurisdictions, currency volatility, regulatory shifts, tax consequences and credit constraints—to illustrate the complex set of internal and external pressures that require continuous resource allocation, risk assessment and operational flexibility.  We describe our strategic mitigation mechanisms, including geographic diversification, proactive market research, comprehensive insurance and hedging arrangements, to maintain business continuity and reconfigure financial and operational structures under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.  Our liquidity management framework contemplates swift responses to cash shortfalls—such as asset divestitures, debt refinancing, lease renegotiation or lease rate adjustment—to preserve firm performance under unexpected events.  We highlight our development and acquisition programs, which leverage economies of scale, land-bank value creation and disciplined capital deployment to support ongoing growth and resilience in turbulent markets.  Insurance coverage for natural hazards and robust disaster recovery plans address emergency management and crisis response needs, while internal controls, regulatory compliance programs and cyber-security defenses reinforce organizational health and system integrity.  Our financing strategy relies on active interest-rate and currency-risk hedging, credit facility management and credit-rating oversight to safeguard our balance-sheet strength and future orientation.  Co-investment ventures and joint-venture contributions exemplify inter-organizational collaboration and dynamic resource reconfiguration aimed at sustaining performance and competitive advantage.  Management’s same-store operating metrics, including rising occupancy and rental rate growth, further demonstrate positive adjustment under challenging conditions, while our emphasis on talent retention and succession planning underpins organizational capabilities and adaptive strategies for maintaining core operations and fostering long-term evolution.

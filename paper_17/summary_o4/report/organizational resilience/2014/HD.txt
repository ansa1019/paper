The Company’s annual report describes a comprehensive resilience framework that emphasizes the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite internal or external variations and disturbances, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The Risk Factors section warns that intense competitive pressures, evolving consumer preferences and unexpected weather conditions could materially and adversely affect pricing, margins, inventory levels, customer service and market share if the Company is unable to timely identify and respond to these environmental perturbations through operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and strategic initiatives. To support business continuity and transform itself in the face of disruption, the Company invests in attracting, training and retaining highly qualified associates, implements supply chain and merchandising transformation tools to streamline operations and enhance its interconnected retail platform—including programs such as BOSS, BOPIS and pilot BODFS—routinely reviews and adapts its information systems and cybersecurity processes with enhanced encryption, EMV chip-and-pin technology and identity protection services, and maintains network security and privacy liability insurance to safeguard system integrity against evolving cyber threats, natural disasters and other hazards. In addition, disciplined capital allocation, diversified financing sources, backup credit facilities and strategic acquisitions are deployed to ensure adequate resource generation, reconfiguration and recovery capabilities, thereby reinforcing the Company’s systemic capacity to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change and maintain organizational performance under pressure.

The company’s disclosures emphasize its exposure to a wide range of internal and external pressures and its corresponding efforts to preserve continuity and performance under adverse conditions.  It acknowledges that “disruptions in the economies of such countries could cause, contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro-economic conditions” and that “this uncertainty, as well as concern over governmental austerity measures including higher taxes and reduced government spending, could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand.”  It also warns that “other unforeseen events beyond our control, such as oil prices, terrorist attacks, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods and volcanic eruptions, travel related health concerns including pandemics and epidemics … can disrupt travel or otherwise result in declines in travel demand,” and that because “these events or concerns are largely unpredictable, they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers.”  In response, the company reports that it “has taken and continue to take steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems,” including maintaining “redundant systems and hosting services,” but notes that “it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business, and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur,” and that “we do not have a completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business.”  The annual report further describes efforts to bolster operational flexibility and capacity—warning that “if our systems cannot be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, decreased customer satisfaction and delays in the introduction of new services, any of which could impair our reputation, damage our brands and materially and adversely affect our results of operations”—while acknowledging that such resilience measures “are expensive, may reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.”  It identifies human capital as a critical resource, stating that “our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees” and warning that “if we are unable to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage required personnel, which may limit our growth, damage our reputation, negatively affect our financial performance, and otherwise harm our business.”  Cybersecurity and data privacy are likewise framed as systemic risks, with the company noting that “it is possible that computer circumvention capabilities, new discoveries or advances or other developments … could result in a compromise or breach of consumer data” and that “security breaches could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure, … as well as loss of customer, financial or other data that could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business,” leading to “negative publicity, damage [to] our reputation, … litigation and possible liability, subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions, or cause consumers to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the services of our competitors.”  The report also stresses the company’s dependence on third-party digital channels and services for traffic generation and distribution, warning that “our reliance on third party websites, including online search engines, meta-search and travel research services, and affiliate marketing as means of generating traffic to our websites may be harmed by changes in search engine algorithms or traffic-generating arrangements” and that “competition is intense and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost.”  In light of rapid technological and market shifts, particularly in mobile platforms, the company warns that “if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated mobile offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if our mobile offerings are not used by consumers, we could lose market share to existing competitors or new entrants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.”  Finally, the company highlights the challenges of sustained international expansion—“continued rapid international expansion in regions throughout the world … places demands on our time and resources” and “increases the complexity of our business and places additional strain on our management, operations, technical performance, financial resources and internal … controls,” warning that “if we are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding in new and existing markets and effectively managing that expansion, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.”

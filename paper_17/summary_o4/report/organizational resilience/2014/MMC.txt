The company’s disclosures describe a range of risk management and business continuity practices that support its ability to absorb strain and maintain performance in the face of internal or external variations and disturbances, including the establishment of liabilities for errors-and-omissions claims through case-level reviews by inside and outside counsel, internal actuarial analyses and quarterly adjustments as developments warrant, the maintenance of varying levels of third-party insurance coverage with policy limits and terms that adapt year to year, and compliance programs that allocate resources to meet extensive legal and regulatory requirements across jurisdictions.  The firm’s information-security and privacy controls—periodic testing, policies, procedures and technical safeguards—are designed to protect confidential, personal and proprietary data against improper disclosure, vendor breakdowns or cyberattacks, yet the company acknowledges the risk that it may be unable to detect or remediate all system deficiencies in a timely manner, which could disrupt operations, damage reputation and impair service delivery.  The company further maintains business-continuity plans and key-management succession protocols intended to ensure operational flexibility and recovery in the event of natural or man-made disasters—earthquakes, cyber events, infrastructure failures or pandemics—but notes that a significant disaster or failure to recover could materially interrupt operations, lead to loss of human capital, regulatory actions and reputational harm.  Recognizing competitive and technological pressures, the company emphasizes the need to anticipate and integrate current technologies and methodologies, execute strategic initiatives and capture efficiencies in processes and infrastructure to preserve integrity and performance under changing market conditions, and notes that failures to respond effectively to consolidation, currency fluctuations, client mergers, or rapid technological change could adversely affect its ability to serve clients and sustain organizational health.  Global operations expose the company to economic, political, tax, legal and compliance risks—exchange-rate movements, withholding taxes, transfer-pricing issues, import/export restrictions and hostilities—that require ongoing adaptation of organizational practices and strategic resource allocation to preserve continuity, maintain performance, and emerge from disruptive events with competitive advantage.  Finally, the company acknowledges that the loss of key professionals, miscalculations in pension funding assumptions or market-driven volatility in investment assets could impose sudden constraints on operational resources, requiring rapid reconfiguration of strategic responses to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

Boeing’s disclosures emphasize its ability to maintain continuity and adapt to challenging conditions by employing pricing mechanisms that “account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date” through indexed price escalation formulas, increasing and ramping production rates for key programs such as the 737, 787, 787-10, 737 Max and 777X while engaging in ongoing development and productivity improvements, and optimizing inventory management in collaboration with suppliers. The company acknowledges that if “production rate ramp-up efforts … are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components … at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer,” and that “operational challenges impacting the production system … could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand,” which would harm revenues and margins. To mitigate such risks, Boeing relies on extensive coordination with subcontractors for raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, recognizes that “if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs,” and continues to “seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft … identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory.” The company’s program and contract accounting practices involve detailed judgment to estimate revenues and costs over long-term, multi-year programs, requiring “assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues,” and noting that “changes in customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements … can impact these estimates,” so that “materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions.” Boeing also highlights its ability to withstand macroeconomic and industry pressures—such as cyclical airline demand, fuel price volatility, terrorism, financing constraints, environmental regulations and intense global competition supported by government launch aid—through focused cost-competitiveness and efficiency initiatives, diversified financing solutions including its commercial paper program and Boeing Capital arrangements, and maintenance of substantial borrowing capacity. The company further identifies risks to business continuity from “threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises,” noting that “any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services.” Labor relations with union-represented workforces, pension and postretirement benefit obligations sensitive to discount rate and asset return assumptions, environmental remediation liabilities, extensive U.S. government procurement regulations, and concentration in certain customer financing portfolios are also disclosed as factors that require ongoing risk assessment, strategic flexibility and resource allocation to preserve or improve functioning under adverse or unpredictable conditions.

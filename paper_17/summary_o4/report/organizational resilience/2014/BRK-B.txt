Berkshire’s board of directors has established and continually monitors a detailed succession plan for key leadership, identifying capable subsidiary managers to succeed Mr. Buffett and retaining the flexibility to revise its replacement strategy to preserve continuity in major investment and capital allocation decisions.  Our operating businesses employ an unusually decentralized model, with qualified and competent local management directing day-to-day activities, while senior corporate management sets capital allocation priorities, establishes governance “tone at the top,” and oversees compliance and risk-mitigation efforts.  We maintain exceptional capital strength, including a large statutory surplus in our insurance subsidiaries, and insist on ample liquidity—favoring safety over yield in cash equivalents—so that we can absorb financial strain, fund ongoing capital investments and capacity expansions, and support improved service levels under changing conditions.  Cyber risks are addressed through business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, and our finance and energy businesses secure required funding through a mix of cash flows and debt issuances supported by redundant liquidity buffers.  We believe these combined governance, resource allocation and operational flexibility measures enable Berkshire to preserve or enhance its functioning and performance under adverse, unexpected or rapidly changing environments.

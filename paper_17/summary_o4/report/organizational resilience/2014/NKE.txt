Nike’s risk disclosures emphasize the company’s reliance on adaptive operational capabilities to maintain continuity under challenging conditions, noting that failure to timely anticipate and respond to competitive, consumer-preference, or market-environment shifts may increase costs or depress demand. The company identifies a broad range of internal and external pressures—including complex supply-chain dependencies on independent contract manufacturers exposed to transportation delays, port strikes, facility disruptions, labor-cost inflation, and variable input-cost baskets; inventory imbalances arising from forecast errors; interruptions in data and information technology systems; adverse weather events; natural disasters; geopolitical instability; terrorism; and product-security or regulatory developments—that could fragment its operations and erode performance. Nike underscores its investment in innovation, resource generation, and knowledge absorption through research and development, specialist networks, and endorsement partnerships to preserve brand strength and service innovation across global retail and direct-to-consumer channels, which themselves require significant fixed investment, operating flexibility, and digital transformation to withstand seasonal and regional volatility. To mitigate currency-driven variability in product costs, revenues, and translated earnings, the company has implemented a centrally managed foreign-exchange risk-management program—anchored by the Nike Trading Company purchasing hub, foreign-currency adjustment arrangements with factories, and targeted use of forward contracts and options as cash-flow hedges—as well as net-investment hedges for key subsidiaries. Finally, the company maintains business-interruption insurance, monitors lease and endorsement commitments, and continually realigns financial, tax, and insurance strategies to preserve organizational flexibility, reconfigure resources, and sustain performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

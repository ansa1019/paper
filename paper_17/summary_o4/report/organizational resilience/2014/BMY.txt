To maintain organizational resilience, we have established a formal governance framework under the SEC consent order that includes a business risk and disclosure group, engagement of external consultants to re‐engineer our accounting and reporting processes, strict inventory management agreements with wholesalers supplying weekly product‐level on‐hand and sell‐through data, and processes to escalate and resolve compliance concerns in real time. Recognizing our dependence on suppliers, vendors and alliance partners in markets exposed to political, social, infrastructure and natural disaster risks, we require third parties to implement business continuity plans in a crisis to mitigate operational disruption. We have invested in industry‐appropriate protections and continuous monitoring of our critical information technology systems to guard against breakdowns, intrusions and data breaches that could impede operations. We continue to monitor adverse economic conditions in certain European markets for impacts on prescription trends, pricing, receivable collections and customer creditworthiness, and maintain liquidity through cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, undrawn credit facilities and strong credit ratings to meet normal cash obligations including dividends, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. In a dynamic market and regulatory environment where events can swiftly alter expectations and asset values, we apply risk-adjusted cash-flow forecasts, actuarial valuations and periodic reviews to ensure adaptive resource deployment, preserve system integrity and support our ability to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

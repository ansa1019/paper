The corporation’s comprehensive enterprise risk management framework is designed to ensure organizational resilience by establishing a strong risk culture and risk governance structure with board and committee oversight, articulating a clear risk appetite, and integrating risk management processes that proactively identify, measure, monitor, and control risk. Management supports resilience through diversified funding strategies, maintaining global excess liquidity sources of high-quality unencumbered assets, and implementing liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio standards to safeguard business continuity under stressed conditions. Robust contingency funding plans and recovery planning, including stress testing under historical and hypothetical scenarios, provide the basis for operational flexibility and crisis response to ensure timely reconstitution of liquidity. The corporation’s system of global capital planning, capital buffers, and comprehensive capital analysis and review underpins resilience by aligning financial resources with strategic objectives and stress test outcomes. Operational risk management, encompassing business recovery planning, scenario analysis, risk and control self-assessments, and information security measures, supports continued functioning in the event of internal or external disruptions. In the mortgage segment, combined economic hedges of servicing rights, interest rate locks, and loans held-for-sale mitigate interest rate and prepayment risks, contributing to resilience in volatile markets. The corporation also maintains compliance risk monitoring and adherence programs to address evolving regulatory requirements, further underpinning its capacity to adapt and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

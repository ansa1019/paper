In line with the scholarly definition of organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions,” UPS conducts operations in over 220 countries and territories, acknowledges that macroeconomic cycles and local economic environments are beyond its control and may require the adjustment of its business model to mitigate adverse impacts, and continually adjusts its integrated air and ground network capacity and cost structure to match prevailing volume mix levels. The company has invested significantly in facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of its On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation system (“ORION”) to increase network capacity, operational flexibility, efficiency and reliability, while utilising new or expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit and maintain service continuity during periods of changing volume and market trends. UPS employs indexed fuel surcharges and hedging transactions to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates, and maintains a mix of self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs supported by actuarial assumptions to address workers’ compensation, liability and health and welfare claims, recognizing that increased claims frequency or severity could adversely affect its financial condition. The company monitors and manages exposures to stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security and cyber requirements, severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, privacy breaches and IT system disruptions, strikes or work stoppages, any of which could interrupt operations or damage its brand and reputation, and it makes significant capital investments while forecasting volume based on economic, regulatory and competitive factors and adjusting other elements of its operations and cost structure in response to adverse conditions. Strategic initiatives—including yield management, service innovation for e-commerce and omni-channel retail, inter-organizational collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances—are pursued to reconfigure resources, preserve or improve functioning under internal and external pressures, and sustain competitive advantage and performance under pressure; however, UPS acknowledges that its ability to absorb strain and maintain operational continuity could be compromised if these measures are insufficient to counteract economic, regulatory or competitive challenges.

The company discloses that “operational failures could harm our business and reputation” and that an “operational failure in our transaction processing businesses, including our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, could harm our business or cause us to lose clients,” with interruptions of service capable of causing data loss, revenue reduction and reputation damage. It cautions that “security breaches, computer malware or other ‘cyber attacks’ could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damaging our reputation” by “disrupt[ing] the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors,” forcing the organization to “invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.” The company acknowledges that it “may experience software defects, development delays or installation difficulties” that could result in interruption of business operations, “delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims.” It further recognizes that acquisitions present risks through the “difficulty in integrating operations” which “may disrupt our business and divert our resources.” The failure to “attract and retain key personnel” is noted as a risk to its sophisticated services and compliance requirements, as “if we cannot hire or retain the necessary skilled personnel, we could suffer delays in new product development, experience difficulty complying with applicable requirements or otherwise fail to satisfy our clients’ demands.” The company’s strategic response includes “implement[ing] a series of strategic initiatives” encompassing active portfolio management, enhancing client relationships, “improving operational effectiveness,” disciplined capital allocation, and “differentiating our products and services through innovation.” It emphasizes adaptability to “constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards” and warns that “if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace … we could lose clients.” The firm “expects that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment,” and it anticipates benefiting from the “trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions” and from “economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive.” It contends that its “sizable and diverse client base” and focus on “long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services” give it “a solid foundation for growth” and “have reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us.” The company further acknowledges exposure to “U.S. and global market and economic conditions,” noting that “a prolonged poor economic environment could result in significant decreases in demand” for its non-discretionary services. Towards mitigating these pressures, it continually invests in risk assessment and compliance, “modif[ies] the manner in which we provide products and services” in response to evolving regulations, and maintains diversified revenue streams to preserve operational integrity and performance under adverse conditions.

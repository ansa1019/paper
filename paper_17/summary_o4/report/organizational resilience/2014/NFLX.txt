Netflix’s 10-K discloses that “any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations … could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data … and could adversely impact our business,” and emphasizes that “our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties we utilize in our operations.” The report warns that “interruptions in these systems … could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver streaming content or fulfill DVD selections,” and that “service interruptions, errors in our software or the unavailability of computer systems used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our membership service to existing and potential members.” In response to cybersecurity risks—“including cyber attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions”—the company “has implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems,” although “this is no assurance that hackers may not be successful in the future.” Netflix maintains its own communications and computer hardware systems as well as third-party “cloud” computing services and proprietary and third-party content delivery networks “to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the Internet,” while noting that “problems faced by us or our third-party … providers … could adversely impact the experience of our members.” The 10-K further highlights that “in connection with obtaining streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments … given the multiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments … our margins may be adversely impacted,” illustrating resource commitment trade-offs, and that the company “is devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming … to help differentiate our service,” yet concedes that “to the extent our original programming does not meet our expectations … our business … may be adversely impacted.” Netflix also outlines that disruptions or changes in “payment processing systems,” “increases in payment processing fees and/or changes to rules or regulations concerning payment processing,” and “fraudulent use of payment methods” “could impact our revenue, operating expenses and results of operation.” Intellectual property disputes are described as potentially “costly and result in the loss of significant rights,” requiring the company to “develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust our merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims.” As Netflix “expands our operations internationally,” it notes “regulatory, economic and political risks” such as “adverse tax consequences,” “fluctuations in currency exchange rates,” “differing payment processing systems,” “new and different sources of competition,” and “availability of reliable broadband connectivity,” which “could negatively affect our business.” The company acknowledges its need to “manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices,” and warns that if it is “not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.” These disclosures collectively reflect Netflix’s strategies and commitments to maintain service continuity, adapt operational structures and allocate resources in the face of external perturbations, competitive and regulatory pressures, and technological challenges, consistent with maintaining organizational integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

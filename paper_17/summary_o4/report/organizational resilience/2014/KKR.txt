KKR states that it attempts to mitigate known risks to the extent it believes to be practicable and reasonable, yet acknowledges no assurance that such risk mitigation efforts will be successful. Its business continuity depends on managing exposures to challenging market conditions, economic uncertainty, and fluctuations in securities prices, and its ability to respond to adverse financial market events—including disruptions in debt financing and volatility in commodity and currency markets—remains subject to external pressures outside its control. The firm highlights the importance of its business continuation and disaster recovery programs for its principal offices and information systems, noting that disruptions to infrastructure or cyber-security breaches could materially impede its operations despite protective measures. KKR’s expansion into new business lines and acquisitions exposes it to integration risks where anticipated synergies may not materialize, requiring organizational flexibility to adjust operations and governance processes, and its strategic initiatives are monitored through specific investment, risk, and conflicts-management committees charged with assessing the ongoing viability of new ventures. In addition, KKR’s reliance on key personnel, extensive third-party relationships, information technology, and regulated infrastructure requires robust organizational capabilities to retain talent, ensure compliance with evolving regulations, and coordinate responses to legal, tax or regulatory changes that could divert senior management attention and increase operational costs. The firm also acknowledges that changing U.S. and foreign tax laws, especially those affecting publicly traded partnerships and carried-interest structures, introduce additional uncertainties that may impact its operational planning and resource allocation. Its capital markets activities, which support both managed portfolios and third-party transactions, require active risk management to maintain adequate liquidity, syndication capacity, and ongoing capital commitments while navigating complex financing arrangements. Finally, KKR emphasizes that its earnings, cash flows, and ability to distribute capital are highly variable, often driven by unpredictable realization events, and it maintains a framework to monitor its balance sheet investment portfolio, liquidity position, and funding obligations—such as revolving credit facilities, senior notes and capital commitments—to preserve operational continuity and positive adjustment under extreme or exceptional conditions.

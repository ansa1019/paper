Risks that could challenge our organizational resilience include the potential inability to acquire needed spectrum to continue customer growth, expand into new areas, maintain service quality and deploy new technologies, and the risk that burdensome conditions, capacity constraints or delayed deployment could materially affect our ability to attract and retain customers; the vulnerability of our information systems to cyber-attacks, unauthorized access, distribution of confidential information, errors by third-party suppliers and evolving security threats that require continual evaluation and adaptation of our systems and processes; the potential for system failures, business disruptions and supplier outages—stemming from human error, severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war, power surges, equipment failure or theft of proprietary information—to prevent reliable service delivery, cause customer losses, revenue declines, reputational damage and litigation; the risk that disruptions in our supply chain, including failures of key suppliers, service providers or third-party retailers, or difficulties during transitions to new vendors could severely disrupt operations and financial performance; the challenges and risks inherent in major operational changes such as transferring our customer billing systems to a new platform and decommissioning redundant cell sites, which if marked by unanticipated difficulties, delays or errors could negatively impact customer experience and internal controls; the necessity of ongoing capital expenditures and operating expenses to enhance products, services, network quality and coverage in response to rapidly changing customer demands and technological developments such as LTE deployment, which may be hindered by scheduling or permitting issues, supplier delays or increased costs; the constraints imposed by debt covenants that may limit our flexibility to react to economic or industry shifts; sensitivity to macro-economic conditions that may affect customer demand, terminations and suppliers’ viability; the imperative to maintain effective internal controls, fraud detection processes and regulatory compliance to avoid financial penalties, reputational harm and resource drains; the dependency on attracting, motivating and retaining key skilled personnel; and strategic initiatives including spectrum acquisitions, network modernization, decommissioning activities and a receivables factoring arrangement, all of which reflect our efforts to absorb internal and external pressures, reconfigure resources and maintain performance under uncertain and challenging conditions.

Mastercard maintains an information security program reviewed by its board of directors, a business-continuity program and insurance coverage and deploys multiple layers of technical and procedural safeguards, together with routine systems testing, to address and mitigate cyber-attacks, natural disasters, terrorism, workplace violence, technology malfunctions and other catastrophic events that could interrupt authorization, clearing or settlement services and materially reduce transaction processing capacity. The company depends on third-party service providers and varied infrastructure in diverse jurisdictions and acknowledges that failures in these networks or disruptions at primary or backup facilities could impair operational continuity, necessitating rapid adjustment of response trajectories and resource reconfiguration. To absorb strain and preserve system integrity under financial stress arising from issuer or acquirer technical failures, liquidity shortfalls or insolvency, Mastercard guarantees settlement obligations and maintains a $3â€‰billion revolving credit facility for general corporate and contingency-planning purposes, thereby ensuring liquidity and supporting uninterrupted operations. Through continuous enhancement of controls, processes and risk-mitigation measures, the firm sustains core performance and demonstrates its capacity to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

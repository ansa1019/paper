NEE and FPL’s 2014 Form 10-K discloses a comprehensive set of measures and exposures that collectively underpin organizational resilience by enabling the maintenance of service, absorption of shocks and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  These include extensive credit facilities, letters of credit, surety bonds and commercial paper programs “available for general corporate purposes and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies’ … operating facilities,” together with regulatory deferral mechanisms and storm-recovery securitizations designed to fund restoration costs and preserve system integrity following extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and droughts.  Regulatory planning and compliance processes address “the effects of regulation on their business” under “complex and comprehensive federal, state and other regulation,” while enterprise-wide productivity and cost-savings initiatives improve operational flexibility and resource allocation in the face of external pressures.  In their risk management framework, the companies employ derivatives programs, hedging strategies and metrics—including daily value at risk, stop-loss limits and liquidity guidelines—to mitigate commodity price volatility and credit exposures, and they maintain special use funds and insurance strategies to ensure funding for nuclear decommissioning and storm damage.  Business continuity plans also contemplate cyber-attack and terrorism threats that “could limit their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power, bill customers and collect and process payments, and could delay their development and construction of new generating facilities,” and they prescribe emergency response actions, replacement power arrangements and stakeholder collaboration to sustain critical operations.  By aligning long-term capital investments in power plant modernization, transmission and distribution infrastructure with predictable rate-base recovery and maintaining upstream dividend policies and funding covenants to safeguard liquidity, NEE and FPL establish a systemic capacity to adapt, recover and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

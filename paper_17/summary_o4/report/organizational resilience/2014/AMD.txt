The Company’s disclosures illustrate a multifaceted approach to preserving and improving functioning despite adversity, noting that the “interrelationship and compounding effects” of simultaneous risks—ranging from aggressive competitor practices and concentrated supplier dependencies to manufacturing yield shortfalls, supply chain disruptions, natural disasters and cyber-security hazards—could “materially adversely affect” its business, financial condition and results of operations. By negotiating successive amendments to its wafer supply agreement, maintaining flexible purchase commitments with GF and diversifying third-party foundry and manufacturing relationships, the Company seeks to “absorb strain” and preserve product supply under internal or external variations. It emphasizes business continuity through demand forecasting, inventory adjustments in light of short product lifecycles, and dynamic resource reconfiguration to address shifting form factors and expand into high-growth adjacent markets. Liquidity management via a secured revolving credit facility and interest rate swap agreements, together with operating and financial covenants, supports operational flexibility and financial risk mitigation. Concurrently, the Company has realigned its organizational structure and implemented a restructuring plan—reducing global headcount, consolidating real estate, simplifying information systems and realigning its real estate footprint—to improve operating efficiencies, reconstitute response trajectories following disruptive events and enhance strategic agility in turbulent markets.

In item 1a risk factors, the company acknowledges that it must manage fluctuating demand for its services and network capacity since significant demand exceeding the designed capacity may cause network difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity, that could compromise service levels and compound the impact of weather and weather-related events on operations. Although the company continues to improve its transportation plan, add capacity, enhance operations at its yards and other facilities, and improve its ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources, it cannot be sure that these measures will fully address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding planned capacity. Similarly, in the event of significant demand reductions, the company may incur increased costs associated with resizing operations, including higher unit operating costs, equipment storage, workforce adjustments, and other related activities. The risk factors further recognize the exposure of the vast rail network to severe weather conditions—earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides, extreme temperatures and precipitation—where line outages and network interruptions can adversely affect revenue, costs and liabilities, prompting targeted capital investments for infrastructure renewal and capacity expansion. The reliance on information technology in all aspects of the business is identified as critical, as insufficient capital for new technology such as positive train control or a cyber attack causing material disruption to IT systems could result in significant safety failures, security breaches or operational difficulties. In item 7 management’s discussion, the executive summary highlights a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, quality control, training and employee engagement through programs such as courage to care, total safety culture and UP Way to reduce risk and eliminate incidents, improve defect detection, close or enhance crossings, and implement best practices. The 2015 outlook reaffirms commitments to add resources to support growth, improve service, replenish surge capability and expand risk assessment strategies and capital investments. The capital plan for 2015 directs approximately 55–60% of investments toward renewing track infrastructure and upgrading equipment, including 218 locomotives, freight cars and containers, while simultaneously increasing network and terminal capacity in the southern region, constructing a major classification yard in Hearne, Texas, developing intermodal, automotive and chemicals facilities, and investing approximately $450 million in positive train control technology. Liquidity and capital resources are managed through cash flows from operations, receivables securitization, bank credit facilities and capital market financing, recognizing that access to these sources could be restricted by deterioration of operating results or financial condition. The company’s share repurchase programs, dividend increases and debt issuances illustrate strategic deployment of financial resources to maintain shareholder value and operational flexibility. Across its risk disclosures and financial discussion, the company describes ongoing efforts to allocate resources, mitigate risks, reconfigure operations and leverage dynamic capabilities to absorb strain, preserve integrity and performance, and maintain business continuity amid internal and external pressures, severe weather, regulatory changes, economic fluctuations, technological disruptions, labor relations challenges, environmental liabilities, fuel price volatility and security threats.

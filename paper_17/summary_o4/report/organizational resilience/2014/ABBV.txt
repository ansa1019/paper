AbbVie has established comprehensive transition services agreements with Abbott to assure operational continuity and business resilience following its separation, enabling a phased implementation of stand-alone back-office infrastructure across global markets. The company maintains liquidity and financial flexibility—through secured revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and board-authorized share repurchase authorizations—thereby mitigating risks to firm performance during environmental or market disruptions. AbbVie’s risk management policies, including designated hedging of foreign currency and interest rate exposures, preserve system resilience against external perturbations and safeguard earnings volatility. Continuous investment in a diversified development pipeline, strategic licensing and collaboration activities, and targeted R&D resource allocation—particularly in response to exclusivity losses in its lipid franchise—demonstrate adaptability and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, positioning the organization to respond effectively to disruptive events and sustain growth. Management’s systematic monitoring of rebate accruals, receivable allowances for governmental health systems, and inventory levels, together with ongoing assessments of macroeconomic trends in southern Europe, illustrate dynamic capabilities to absorb strain and preserve functioning under pressures. The successful launch of new therapies (such as VIEKIRA PAK and DUOPA/DUODOPA) and collaborations with third-party partners (including Calico, Infinity and Ablynx) exemplify the company’s operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration toward future trajectories. Underlying these practices, annual resilience assessments—through impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, actuarial evaluations of post-employment obligations, and stress testing of contractual commitments—ensure that AbbVie maintains organizational integrity, performance continuity, and strategic resilience across hierarchical levels.

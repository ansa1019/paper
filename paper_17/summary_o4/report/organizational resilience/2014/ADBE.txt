The company discloses that its continued viability depends on its ability to anticipate and respond to evolving customer requirements and technological trends, to extend its core technologies into new applications and platforms, and to maintain strategic third-party relationships, warning that any failure, delay or misjudgment in new product development or go-to-market strategies could weaken its competitive position and impair its operating results; it acknowledges that its transition to cloud-based subscription and hosted-service models demands ongoing investment in product development, network infrastructure and data center capacity and that security vulnerabilities, cyber-attacks, software bugs or defects, third-party data center outages, system failures, hardware malfunctions, natural disasters (including earthquakes, floods or fires), telecommunications disruptions or other catastrophic events could interrupt service delivery, cause data loss or corruption, expose it to liability, harm its reputation, and impede its ability to fulfill customer orders; the company further recognizes that it does not maintain full redundancy in all systems, that its disaster recovery planning may not cover every contingency, and that any unauthorized access to or disclosure of proprietary or customer data could result in customer attrition or regulatory enforcement; it also warns that long, complex sales and implementation cycles, risks inherent in acquisitions and integrations, dependencies on indirect sales and distribution channels, and rapidly changing regulatory, economic and geopolitical conditions may introduce uncertainty, require careful resource allocation and risk mitigation measures and test the organizationâ€™s operational flexibility and resilience in adverse or unexpected situations.

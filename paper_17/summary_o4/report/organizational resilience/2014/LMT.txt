Lockheed Martin seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to its business, but acknowledges that risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted, and accordingly maintains a diversified portfolio of defense, homeland security and information technology products and services, including a broad mix of contract types intended to address changing risk and reward profiles over a program’s life cycle. By carefully assessing and monitoring contract performance risk—including cost, schedule and technical challenges—and deploying strategies such as multi‐year supply agreements, performance‐based payments, cost‐reimbursable vehicles and advance funding mechanisms, the company aims to absorb funding interruptions, continuing resolutions and sequestration pressures while preserving operational continuity, cash flow and firm performance. In response to increased market fragmentation, heightened re‐competition on existing contracts, troop drawdowns and shifting funding priorities, Lockheed Martin has reorganized facilities, consolidated operations and reduced workforce levels to better align capacity with workload, improve affordability and maintain operational flexibility and agility. The company leverages its backlog of funded and unfunded orders as an indicator of resilience, and utilizes a robust procurement and compliance framework, outsourced logistics, insurance coverage and structured environmental remediation agreements to ensure continuity in the face of evolving laws, regulations and liability exposures. Anticipating cyber and other security threats, legal and regulatory shifts and a complex competitive landscape, Lockheed Martin invests in advanced threat detection and mitigation processes, enhanced internal controls, collaborative networks and targeted acquisitions to strengthen organizational capabilities and preserve system integrity under adverse conditions. Through disciplined capital deployment—encompassing strategic planning, ongoing R&D investment, share repurchases, dividend growth and careful debt management—the company sustains financial strength and liquidity to adapt its cost structure and resource allocation in response to operational disruptions or external disturbances. Moreover, Lockheed Martin continuously evaluates pension funding, environmental and legal contingencies, employs actuarial assumptions and judgment in estimating liabilities, and negotiates cost‐allowability under federal acquisition regulations to mitigate adverse cost impacts, thereby supporting the maintenance of performance, organizational health and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

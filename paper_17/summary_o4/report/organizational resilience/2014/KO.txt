Coca-Cola’s 10-K describes a broad set of capabilities and initiatives that together support the company’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The company has established a robust water stewardship and management program—assessing water-related risks, improving water-use efficiency, treating wastewater, replenishing water supplies and collaborating with governments and nongovernmental organizations—to address water scarcity and protect community prosperity.  It has built an information risk management program that is overseen by IT management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee, invests in personnel, technologies, cyber-insurance and training, and maintains business continuity plans designed to mitigate service interruptions, security breaches and cyber-attacks.  Through a multi-year productivity and reinvestment program launched in 2012 and expanded in 2014, the company has realigned resources via global supply-chain optimization, zero-based budgeting, operating-model simplification and enhanced marketing effectiveness to accelerate decision-making, improve operational flexibility and drive sustainable growth.  Strategic refranchising and integration of bottling operations, along with partnerships in key product categories, are reconfiguring its franchise system to strengthen local market focus, share best practices and preserve distribution capabilities under varied economic, regulatory and environmental pressures.  The company’s risk management framework extends to climate change adaptation, commodity cost hedging, foreign currency and tax exposure management, regulatory compliance, and sustainable agriculture investments, all intended to safeguard supply chains, financial performance and brand integrity.  By continually assessing emerging risks, reallocating resources, refining organizational structures and fostering innovation, Coca-Cola endeavors to absorb strain, reconfigure its system under internal and external variations, and preserve its operational and financial health in the face of adversity.

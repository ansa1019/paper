In its risk disclosures the company notes that “ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans,” and emphasizes the need to “adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants” such as mobility, cloud-based computing, digital, data analytics and SaaS solutions. It warns that failure to “keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand,” “deploy our employees globally on a timely basis” or “effectively assimilate and utilize new employees,” as well as insufficient “investment in new technology and industry developments,” could materially impair its operational flexibility, margins and competitive position. The report also highlights that it maintains business continuity and disaster recovery plans to mitigate risks from “acts of terrorism, civil unrest, natural disasters, pandemics or other acts of God” and from “extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services,” while its global delivery network and currency hedging programs are described as means of reconfiguring and mitigating financial exposures and performance variability under internal or external disturbances. Strategic initiatives including targeted acquisitions, joint ventures and cost-management actions are presented as mechanisms for preserving and enhancing the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning, maintain integrity under extreme or exceptional conditions and transform operations to emerge stronger from challenging situations, drawing attention to a systemic perspective on resilience.

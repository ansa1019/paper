Tesla discloses that “we may experience significant delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch and production ramp” of new models, a risk it seeks to mitigate by planning to “expand capacity in several areas” — including “installing a state of the art, highly automated casting and machining operation,” increasing drive unit line production, installing a “robotic body assembly shop” and commissioning a new paint facility — while focusing on “supplier capabilities and constraints,” negotiating cost reductions and redesigning parts to “make them cheaper to produce.” The company warns that “Model S production and deliveries will continue to require significant resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity,” underscoring the need to “carefully analyze each step of our production plan, improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and continue to train our employees.” To address quality and reliability challenges, Tesla “attempts to remedy … issues experienced by our customers in a rapid manner” through self-insurance, extended warranties and targeted recall initiatives. Seeking cost and supply security, it intends to “integrate the production of lithium-ion cells and finished battery packs” at its Gigafactory in partnership with Panasonic, while acknowledging the risk that “the cost of building and operating the Gigafactory could exceed our current expectations.” To bolster organizational flexibility and service continuity, Tesla is “continuing to deploy Tesla Superchargers,” opening stores and service centers globally, deploying mobile Tesla Rangers, and “expanding and improving upon” its information technology systems to manage higher volume production, logistics, sales and service. It has also introduced resale value guarantees and leasing programs, “applying lease accounting” to defer revenue and cost recognition while retaining residual value risk, and it continuously assesses “supplier compliance with quality control standards,” “supplier and commodity-related costs,” regulatory changes, “foreign currency movements,” and other internal or external pressures, thereby adapting resource deployment, reconfiguring processes and preserving performance under challenging conditions.

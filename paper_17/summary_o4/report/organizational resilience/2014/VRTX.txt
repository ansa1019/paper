We rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers to manufacture and distribute our drugs for commercial use and our drug candidates for clinical trials and, as a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control. Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor that requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. Although we attempt to manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations, and supply disruptions may result from shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. Any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials and may require us to modify our production methods, which could result in abrupt changes in our production methods and supplies. We also rely on third parties to conduct certain pre-clinical work and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements, which reduces our control over these activities and could delay the completion of clinical trials or our ability to obtain regulatory approvals. If our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed, as this could disrupt our operations and result in a significant disruption in our research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities, the loss of critical data and/or large expenses to repair or replace the facility. We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business, and a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to both private and governmental causes of action. We are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations, including health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal anti-kickback law and federal false claims statutes, laws prohibiting off-label product promotion and other similar laws, and if we are found not to be in full compliance, our business could be materially harmed. We have expanded and are continuing to expand our global operations and capabilities, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure. To effectively manage our business, we need to implement and clearly communicate our corporate-wide strategies; enhance our operational and financial infrastructure, including our controls over records and information; enhance our operational, financial and management processes; train and manage our global employee base; transition from a U.S.-centric company into an organization capable of developing and commercializing multiple drug candidates in international markets; and enhance our compliance and legal resources. Failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified scientists, professionals, sales personnel and senior management, or to effectively integrate new scientific and management personnel into our business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, particularly given intense competition for personnel and the high cost of living in our operating areas. Additionally, our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, and the terms of our credit agreement impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks.

The risk factors set forth in this report describe risks and uncertainties that could impede the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations, including disruptions in global credit and financial markets, economic uncertainties that may cause customers to postpone spending or cancel or delay orders, credit risk exposure from customer payment delays or defaults, product delays and inventory challenges arising from supplier or distributor financial difficulties, and additional charges relating to restructuring costs or asset impairments if economic conditions deteriorate.  Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income may materially fluctuate due to adverse economic conditions, changes in customer demand, our ability to manage cost structure over time, fluctuations in manufacturing yields and availability of wafers and raw materials, capacity constraints, the performance of third-party suppliers and subcontractors, and natural disasters, public health emergencies, security risks, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.  The cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, rapid technological changes and difficulties in forecasting operating expense levels further challenge our ability to preserve or improve functioning and adapt to environmental perturbations.  Our success depends upon our capacity to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate and invest in research and development despite resource constraints, satisfy evolving industry standards and high quality and reliability requirements imposed by customers, and identify and penetrate new markets where competition and credit risk may be intense.  We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to support financial reporting, order processing, inventory management, shipments, proprietary information security and technical activities, but these systems are susceptible to disruptions, security breaches, power outages, hardware or telecommunication failures and other unforeseen events, any of which could disrupt operational continuity, result in the loss of sales or customers and impose significant incremental costs.  We depend on third-party suppliers, subcontractors, manufacturers and freight carriers for wafers, assembly, test services and transportation, and reduced control over their availability, manufacturing yields, delivery schedules and costs can lead to supply chain instability, capacity constraints, production delays, the need to engage additional or replacement suppliers and the temporary or permanent loss of customers.  Our operations in geologically unstable locations expose us to hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding and other natural disasters that could disrupt manufacturing capacity, raw material availability, utilities and equipment services, and any prolonged inability to utilize our facilities or those of our subcontractors could result in lost sales and a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  We maintain confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and strategic partners and employ security measures to control access and distribution of proprietary information, yet breaches by third-party service providers or unauthorized parties could lead to misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, causing significant financial or reputational damage.  Our ability to recruit, retain and motivate qualified personnel, especially experienced engineers and key management, is critical to our adaptability and execution of strategic initiatives; loss of key personnel or increased turnover rates may strain our organizational health and hinder performance under pressure.  In order to sustain competitive advantage, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology or enter into strategic transactions to enhance our product portfolio, expand market coverage or increase engineering capacity; such transactions carry integration risks, potential unforeseen liabilities, diversion of management focus, and the possibility of not realizing anticipated synergies or growth prospects.  Litigation, including intellectual property claims, may require us to redesign products, pay significant royalties or indemnification obligations, divert technical resources from other product development efforts and damage our reputation, impairing our ability to respond effectively to disruptive events.  We are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations that may require costly compliance measures, changes to manufacturing processes or substitution of regulated materials, and violations or failures to control hazardous materials could lead to liability, penalties, operational discontinuity or reputational harm.  Our international operations expose us to political, legal, economic, regulatory, tax, currency and geopolitical risks that may constrain resource deployment, increase managerial complexity, limit repatriation of earnings and adversely affect our ability to maintain performance under variable environmental conditions.  Compliance with government contracting regulations, security clearances for personnel and the ability to service our indebtedness, including scheduled principal and interest payments under our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility covenants, are material to our financial resilience; failure to comply or generate sufficient cash flow may require refinancing, asset sales, repatriation of earnings at higher tax rates or reduction of capital and operating expenditures, each of which could impair our future strategic agility and organizational strength.  Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, including $2.9 billion in principal sources of liquidity at November 1, 2014, along with cash generated from operations, are expected to be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, dividend payments and stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months; however, foreign-held cash intended for indefinite reinvestment is not readily available for U.S. requirements, and repatriation would entail additional tax liabilities.  We completed the acquisition of Hittite Microwave Corporation on July 22, 2014, financed through existing cash and a 90-day term loan, recognizing $1.4 billion of goodwill, $666.4 million of intangible assets and incurring transaction-related costs, thereby reconfiguring our reporting lines and augmenting our capabilities to absorb strain and transform under challenging market conditions.  Our working capital management reflects a 22% year-over-year increase in accounts receivable and a 30% rise in inventory to support anticipated higher sales demand and acquisitions, with days in sales outstanding remaining at 44 days and days cost of sales in inventory temporarily reduced to 102 days due to acquisition-related inventory fair-value adjustments.  Deferred revenue from sales to distributors, which permits price-adjustment credits and product returns to manage slow-moving or obsolete inventory, increased to $278.4 million net, reflecting strategic mitigation of credit and inventory risks.  We maintain a share repurchase program authorizing up to $5.6 billion of repurchases, of which $4.8 billion has been executed to date, and a dividend policy currently at $0.37 per share per quarter, each subject to board determination and designed to optimize capital structure and return value to shareholders while preserving operational flexibility.  Our contractual obligations, including operating leases, long-term debt principal and interest payments, deferred compensation and pension funding commitments, amount to $1.1 billion in future cash outflows, underscoring the importance of sustained cash flow generation and strategic foresight to preserve system integrity and ensure the maintenance of organizational functioning under varying internal and external pressures.

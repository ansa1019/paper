The company discloses that its rapid growth and evolving market conditions place continuous and significant strain on its management, operational, and financial resources, requiring it to absorb that strain and preserve or improve functioning by improving and expanding its information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and its ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. It acknowledges that any deficiencies in these systems and processes could disrupt customer relationships, limit product deployments, or increase technical support costs, and that integrating and training new employees and acquired personnel quickly and effectively is essential to confront complexity and maintain organizational health. The firm recognizes that its reliance on third-party manufacturers, distributors, and resellers exposes it to potential supply shortages, manufacturing and logistics disruptions—whether due to natural disasters, regional instability, pandemics, or capacity constraints—and that without effective coordination and contingency planning, these external pressures could impair order fulfillment, delay revenue, and damage its reputation. It warns that its operating results and cash flows are likely to vary unpredictably under nominal, extreme, or exceptional conditions, driven by external disturbances such as macroeconomic shifts, competitive landscape changes, regulatory developments, or errors in forecasting demand, and that careful risk assessment, resource reallocation, and diversification of suppliers and partners are necessary to mitigate such risks. The company further emphasizes the importance of enhancing its corporate culture, preserving innovation and teamwork, and fostering organizational learning and strategic agility to adapt to sudden disruptive events, reconfigure its resource deployment, and maintain business continuity and competitive advantage in turbulent markets.

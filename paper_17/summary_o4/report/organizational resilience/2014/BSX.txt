The annual report describes the company’s resilience in maintaining business continuity and financial stability amid intense competition, rapid technological change, pricing pressures and industry consolidation by continuously monitoring global economic, political, regulatory and market dynamics to realign resources across research and development, capital investments and workforce levels while preserving the capacity to fund strategic growth initiatives; by implementing restructuring and plant network optimization programs to simplify manufacturing, reduce costs, improve margins and streamline reporting structures; by preserving investment-grade credit ratings and maintaining a $2 billion revolving credit facility, a $300 million receivables-based financing line and disciplined debt management to ensure liquidity and enable timely settlement of obligations; by planning for the integration of acquired businesses and the management of contingent consideration to safeguard performance; by diversifying supply-chain sources and establishing contingency arrangements for critical components and third-party sterilization to mitigate production disruptions; by upholding robust global regulatory and quality management systems to secure uninterrupted product approvals and manufacturing operations; by utilizing accounts-receivable factoring programs and establishing allowances for doubtful accounts to absorb emerging-market payment volatility; and by conducting proactive tax and legal risk assessments and maintaining contingency reserves for litigation and regulatory matters—each of which demonstrates the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning in adverse conditions and reconfigure its operating model as environmental pressures evolve.

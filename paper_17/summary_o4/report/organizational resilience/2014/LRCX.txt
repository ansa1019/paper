The company acknowledges that its industry’s cyclical nature, marked by frequent periods of rapid change in demand, “challenges our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities,” including timely sizing of supply chain infrastructure, workforce and other business components, and therefore “we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment”; failure to adapt adequately “could leave us without the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations” or could result in over‐expansion beyond actual demand. During periods of rapid growth or decline, the company faces significant challenges in “maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our work force,” and responds through cost management programs “aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams,” while recognizing that “even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in R&D and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive.” The risk of operational disruption is addressed through reviews of primary manufacturing facilities, contingency planning for natural disasters, terrorist acts, IT or utility interruptions, and dependencies on key suppliers and outsource providers, where “a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products and generate revenues.” To mitigate financial exposures, the company hedges certain foreign currency cash flows and maintains revolving credit arrangements subject to covenant restrictions. The company also conducts annual impairment reviews of goodwill and long‐lived assets, reevaluates uncertain tax positions, pursues strategic acquisitions or dispositions to strengthen its product portfolio and technology capabilities, and invests in compliance with evolving environmental and regulatory requirements, all of which support its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances.

The Company notes that its resilience hinges on the integrity and continuity of its data centers, long-term capacity investments in facilities and a skilled workforce that cannot be rapidly adjusted, exposing it to resource-allocation constraints and operational inflexibility under adverse or unexpected conditions. Cyber-security incidents such as unauthorized access, service interruptions or data loss could materially impair its ability to function, damage reputation and expose it to significant liabilities, while the absence of sufficient insurance coverage exacerbates its vulnerability to such hazards. Disruptions may result from internal errors, third-party software defects, configuration mistakes or external events beyond its control—including earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, vandalism and operator error—that can interrupt services, cause customer data loss and undermine business continuity because the Company cannot swiftly switch data centers or relocate customers without risking lengthy outages. Although the Company maintains crisis-management and disaster-response plans, its heavy concentration of operations near seismic faults could demand significant recovery time before operational continuity is restored. Broad market, economic and regulatory shifts—such as fluctuating demand, foreign currency volatility, evolving privacy and data-sovereignty laws or slower adoption of cloud-based solutions—may further impede its performance under pressure, slow growth and impair its ability to mitigate risk. The Company’s capacity to adapt its technology and scale its cloud infrastructure to meet escalating customer requirements remains subject to development lead times and third-party dependencies, and its reliance on key management and specialized personnel introduces further risk to organizational health and continuity of operations. These factors underscore the multifaceted nature of resilience as the Company seeks to preserve or enhance functioning and performance amid internal and external disturbances through strategic investment, risk assessment and operational flexibility.

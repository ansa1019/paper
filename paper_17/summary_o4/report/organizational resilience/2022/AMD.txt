The report emphasizes that interrelationships and compounding effects of simultaneous risks may materially adversely affect business operations, financial condition or operating results, and that global economic and market uncertainty—including inflation, interest rates or recession—may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending, cause customers to postpone purchases, constrain access to capital and impair cash flows and working capital. It recognizes the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has in the past produced severe downturns, supply-demand imbalances, price erosion and substantial losses, and acknowledges the firm’s reliance on third-party wafer foundries and assembly, test and packaging partners to fabricate, assemble and deliver products in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, any failure of which could force allocation of scarce products, delay shipments or damage customer relationships. In its discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic, AMD describes disruptions to the global supply chain, adjustments to supply-chain requirements, long-term purchase commitments, prepayments and flexibility measures designed to maintain a stable supply of materials, as well as the reassessment of product schedules and roadmaps to support remote working requirements and shifts in geographic and market demand while striving to avoid facility closures, transportation delays, labor mobility limitations and inventory shortages. The document further details operational continuity risks from IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks that could compromise intellectual property, sensitive data and internal controls; the challenges of upgrading its enterprise resource planning system without disrupting business continuity, internal controls or sales processes; and the uncertainties of forecasting, ordering and shipment due to short product lifecycles, rapidly changing customer inventory practices, distributor returns and price protection rights that can create excess or obsolete inventory. It also notes that reliance on third-party logistics providers for distribution, transportation management and IT support, as well as the inability to control gray-market sales, can materially disrupt operations and margins. Finally, the report acknowledges that export controls, tariffs, trade protection measures, environmental and data-privacy laws, conflict minerals provisions and forced-labor regulations require ongoing risk assessment, supply-chain diligence and strategic planning, and that its worldwide operations are exposed to natural disasters, political and legal changes, and macroeconomic perturbations that may threaten manufacturing, distribution and financial management, all of which must be managed to preserve organizational integrity, flexibility and performance under challenging conditions.

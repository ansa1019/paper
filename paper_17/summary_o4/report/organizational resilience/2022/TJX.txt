The company’s disclosures emphasize its maintenance of business continuity and operational flexibility under challenging conditions by “appropriately allocating and delivering merchandise to our stores, maintain[ing] an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store and be flexible in our allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories,” relying on an opportunistic buying strategy “with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns” to absorb market fluctuations. It further describes adaptations to external pressures—from “the COVID-19 pandemic” and “global supply chain disruptions, including an increase in competition for limited shipping capacity” to “transport availability, capacity, and costs” and “geopolitical events” such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict—by implementing new operational procedures (“enhanced cleaning protocols, occupancy limitations, and additional health and safety protocols”), effective information sharing and oversight of internal resources and third-party providers, and dynamic staffing and training of an expanding workforce. The risk factors note the necessity of “accurately anticipating our current and future IT needs” and maintaining “effective disaster recovery plans” for critical information technology systems, alongside “policies, procedures and controls designed to reduce the risks of data security compromises and IT failures or disruptions,” as well as ongoing investments across the IT security workforce, technologies, and processes to preserve system integrity. Organizational resilience is also reflected in the company’s flexibility to “expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes,” its forecasting processes that align inventory purchases with sales forecasts, and its disciplined capital and liquidity management—relying on strong cash flows, credit facilities, and targeted debt repayments—to sustain financial performance under internal or external variations. The disclosures acknowledge that “natural or other disasters, such as hurricanes, floods or cyber-attacks,” “unseasonable adverse weather,” and evolving regulatory requirements may “disrupt operations,” necessitating contingency measures such as temporary store or distribution center closures and compliance adaptations, all of which are designed to uphold the company’s functioning, preserve performance, and enhance its ability to respond effectively to adversity.

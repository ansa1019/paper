Analog Devices, Inc. acknowledges that its substantial global operations and manufacturing facilities—both internal and outsourced to third-party suppliers, wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, and freight carriers—are exposed to global political and economic uncertainty, trade disputes, sanctions, complex and evolving regulatory requirements, currency conversion and interest rate fluctuations, inflationary cost pressures, supply-chain constraints, public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, transportation disruptions, natural disasters and other external disturbances that could materially disrupt production, delay shipments, impair customer relationships and constrain access to external financing, and asserts that its long-term contingency planning and strategic initiatives—such as maintaining high levels of cash and cash equivalents diversified among high-credit-quality counterparties, continuously monitoring credit and foreign currency exposures and hedging through forward contracts, managing liquidity and compliance with revolving credit facility covenants, investing significantly in research and development to sustain product leadership and innovation, expanding internal manufacturing capacity, balancing production with demand forecasts and inventory levels, and modifying business practices (including restricting travel, adjusting work locations and canceling in-person meetings)—are intended to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning, and support operational continuity under challenging conditions while executing its business strategy, fostering a corporate culture of innovation and teamwork, recruiting and retaining critical personnel, maintaining stringent quality and reliability standards, and ensuring sufficient financial, technological and organizational resources to adapt to evolving market, regulatory and competitive pressures.

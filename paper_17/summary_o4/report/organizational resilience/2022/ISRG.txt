The company’s disclosures emphasize the maintenance of business continuity and adaptive capacity under challenging conditions, noting that “the global economic environment and additional or unforeseen effects from the covid-19 pandemic amplify many of these risks” and require adjustments to operations, including “increasing our communications with our suppliers and modifying our purchase order coverage and inventory levels” to mitigate supply disruptions arising from supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, inflationary pressures, and fluctuations in labor availability. Hospitals’ financial and operational pressures—stemming from staffing shortages, supply chain environment, and increased inflation—are recognized as threats to their ability to access capital and procure products, requiring the company to consider its ability “to adjust pricing, reduce costs, or implement countermeasures” under higher-inflation conditions. The company acknowledges that its resilience depends on securing human capital, stating that “we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff” and that its corporate culture “fosters innovation, teamwork, and a focus on execution, as well as facilitates critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing,” while it “explor[es] ways to improve the employee experience” in hybrid work models to enhance organizational flexibility. Management’s pandemic response priorities—focused on the “health and safety” of stakeholders, support of customer clinical, operational, and economic needs to “ensure continuity of supply,” the “secur[ing of] our workforce economically,” and continued investment in critical development programs while “eliminating avoidable spend”—illustrate strategic approaches to crisis management and resource allocation. The report further describes resilience strategies in information security, including “programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents” and “cyber insurance coverage,” to preserve system integrity and operational continuity amid cyberattacks and IT disruptions. External pressures from natural disasters, climate change–driven events, and geopolitical conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine crisis are identified as potential sources of operational disruption; the company discloses both its reliance on a diversified supply chain and its lack of multiple-site capacity for all operations, underscoring the need for dynamic risk mitigation and recovery mechanisms. Finally, the company highlights ongoing regulatory and quality system compliance across jurisdictions—through inspections, medical device reporting, and adherence to evolving good manufacturing practice requirements—to sustain product integrity and performance under internal and external variations and disturbances.

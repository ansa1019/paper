In its 2022 Form 10-K, the company describes a multifaceted approach to preserving operational integrity and performance under internal and external variations and disturbances by diversifying and continuously refining its supply chain, manufacturing processes, and financial resources. It maintains multiple sources of supply and long-term contracts for critical materials, invests in advanced manufacturing equipment and process technology across globally dispersed facilities, and implements contingency planning for disruptions arising from natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical tensions, and climate events. To absorb strain and sustain business continuity, the company holds robust cash and investment reserves, secures access to credit facilities, and pursues capital-deployment strategies—including discretionary share repurchases, capacity expansions supported by government incentives under the CHIPS Act, and ongoing evaluation of financing alternatives—to optimize long-range returns and manage liquidity through volatile industry cycles. Its resilience strategies extend to workforce management, with programs to attract, retain, and develop high-skill talent, succession planning, and agile R&D processes that enable timely qualification of new products, as well as governance controls over physical security, intellectual property, and regulatory compliance to ensure crisis preparedness, risk assessment, and recovery capabilities. These measures collectively illustrate the company’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to sudden disruptive change, and maintain or improve functioning despite uncertainty in selling prices, supply constraints, and other unexpected conditions.

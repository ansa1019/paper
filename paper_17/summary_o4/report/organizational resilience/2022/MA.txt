Mastercard’s disclosures describe a broad program of measures designed to preserve organizational resilience by ensuring operational continuity, managing unanticipated disruptions and enabling positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The company emphasizes its reliance on secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information across its global network and third-party providers, and notes that information security incidents, cyber-attacks or account data compromise events could disrupt its business, damage its reputation, increase costs and cause losses.  To mitigate these risks, Mastercard maintains an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies, while continually enhancing its controls, processes and practices to protect systems, software, data and networks from attack or failure.  It also recognizes that temporary unavailability of its transaction switching systems—caused by technology malfunctions, telecommunications outages, extreme weather, terrorism or workplace violence—or security breaches on its real-time account-based payments network could lead to service interruptions, loss of business and reputational harm, especially in jurisdictions where it is deemed critical national infrastructure.  The company further acknowledges that working with new customers and onboarding them onto complex multi-rail solutions carries operational challenges, cost overruns and performance risks that could impair its ability to adapt and flourish in evolving markets, and that inadequate infrastructure in lesser-developed regions may exacerbate service disruptions.  In addition, Mastercard highlights its dependence on a highly qualified and flexible workforce, noting that difficulties in attracting, retaining and deploying talent, as well as changes in work-permitting regulations and hybrid work arrangements, could undermine its capacity for swift response and sustained functioning.  Finally, Mastercard points to external pressures—such as geopolitical sanctions, the global COVID-19 pandemic, shifting regulatory regimes, currency fluctuations and intense competitive threats—which require continuous risk assessment, resource reallocation and strategic adaptation to preserve system integrity, maintain performance at least partially under internal and external disturbances, and emerge stronger from adversity.

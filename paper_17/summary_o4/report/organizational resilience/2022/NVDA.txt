Business disruptions could harm our operations and financial results, as our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, acts of war or other military actions, political and civil unrest, epidemics or pandemics, making our operations, those of third-party vendors and our supply chain vulnerable to catastrophic events that may lead to declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand, enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, place non-cancellable inventory orders, and pay premiums and deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so, and we may incur inventory provisions if our inventory or supply commitments are misaligned with demand for our products. We invest in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all, and if we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and delivery schedules and could harm our business. Modification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls, as we rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions and to comply with regulatory reporting requirements; implementation of new enterprise resource planning systems and subsequent identification or remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls could impose substantial demands on management time and incur significant expenses. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected, and could continue to have a material adverse impact on, our workforce, operations and those of our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers, and we have modified our business and workforce practices, including flexible work and social distancing measures, in response to pandemic-related restrictions, which have caused and may in the future cause us to incur incremental expenses and costs. To defend against cyber-attacks and data-protection breaches, which could disrupt our operations, reduce expected revenue and increase expenses, we must continuously engineer more secure products, enhance security and reliability features, develop our security measures, ensure suppliers have appropriate controls and address evolving threats, although we may not always detect vulnerabilities until after a security incident has occurred or may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures. Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and vendors, as water and energy availability and reliability, extreme weather events, and related insurance and regulatory changes may disrupt operations and increase costs. We are subject to complex and changing laws, rules and regulations worldwide affecting our operations—covering areas including environmental, health and safety requirements, data privacy, cybersecurity, export controls, anti-corruption, and climate change—which can be onerous and expensive to comply with, may negatively impact our competitive position and our ability to manufacture and ship products, and may require us to transition operations or offer alternative products, such as moving research, development, supply and distribution activities out of certain jurisdictions in response to export control restrictions and engaging with customers to provide alternative offerings not subject to new licensing requirements.

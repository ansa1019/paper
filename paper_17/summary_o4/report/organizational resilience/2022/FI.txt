Our operations depend on receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, our employees, our clients and their customers, and any unauthorized access, intrusion, infiltration, network disruption, ransom, denial of service or similar incident could disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or data; accordingly, we expect to continue to invest significant resources to maintain and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities, although we cannot be certain these measures will be successful or sufficient to counter all current and emerging risks and threats. Our business depends heavily on the reliability of our systems, and an operational failure that results in an interruption in the availability of our products and services could harm our business or cause us to lose clients; in such events, we may not be able to successfully or quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets and data through our business continuity program, which, as a provider of payments solutions and other financial services, clients, regulators and others may require us to enhance through disaster recovery plans and frequent testing, all of which may require a significant investment of time and money. The operations and systems of many participants in the global financial system are interconnected, and despite our efforts to work with other participants to avoid disruptions, there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective; similarly, we rely on third parties we do not control to provide us with products and services, including payment card networks, processors, issuers and automated clearing house networks, and if these third parties fail to perform adequately or refuse to provide services on terms acceptable to us, and we are not able to find timely suitable alternatives, we may no longer be able to provide certain services to customers, which could expose us to information security, financial, compliance and reputational risks. We may also be negatively impacted by disruptions to our supply chain or third-party delivery service providers—factories manufacturing our point-of-sale devices or payment cards may close or experience workforce shortages, shipping services may be interrupted or delayed, lead times may increase, shortages or higher costs for certain materials and components may occur, or our third-party support or hosting facilities may suffer workforce shortages—and if we are unable to renew our existing contracts with key vendors and service providers, we might not be able to replace the related product or service at all or at the same cost. To address these and other sources of external pressure, we frequently review our portfolio to ensure we have the necessary business assets to execute our strategy, acquire businesses when we identify a compelling strategic need or an opportunity to achieve business scale that enables competition and operational efficiency, and divest businesses that are not in line with our market, product or financial strategies. Underpinning these steps, our purpose is to deliver superior value for our clients through leading technology, targeted innovation and excellence in everything we do, with a focus on integrating our solutions, delivering operational excellence, allocating capital in a disciplined manner—including share repurchase and merger and acquisition activity—and delivering breakthrough innovation. Our emphasis on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented, non-discretionary products and services has reduced the impact of consolidation in the financial services industry on our business, and we anticipate that continued modernization of our technology, expansion of digital channels and real-time payments infrastructure will help us adapt to evolving market conditions, sustain performance under pressure and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

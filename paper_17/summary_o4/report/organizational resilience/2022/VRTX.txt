In its annual report, the Company acknowledges that its global manufacturing and distribution network, which combines internal capabilities and multiple third‐party relationships, is exposed to potential supply interruptions arising from pandemic‐related travel and work restrictions, regulatory inspection delays, performance failures by contract manufacturers, global health emergencies, geopolitical actions or natural disaster events, any of which could materially impair the Company’s ability to deliver products and sustain operations. To address these vulnerabilities and maintain operational continuity, the Company maintains a comprehensive business continuity plan, applies a site‐specific approach to monitor and adapt to local public health guidance, and invests in the expansion of its quality‐compliant infrastructure and diversified supply base. The report highlights the complex, less‐mature manufacturing processes required for novel cell and genetic therapies, noting significant investments in specialized systems, equipment, facilities and expertise to develop and maintain capacity, and describes the strategic allocation of financial and personnel resources to ensure resilience in the face of internal or external pressures. The Company further notes the intensifying threat of cyber‐attacks, including those targeting hardware or software supply chains, which could interrupt critical IT systems, compromise confidential data and trigger significant liability, and details its use of security measures, insurance coverages and contingency planning to mitigate such risks. Moreover, the Company’s headquarters and key facilities, some situated within designated flood zones, are protected by targeted insurance policies against unanticipated hazardous incidents, yet remain subject to environmental perturbations that could disrupt research, development, manufacturing or commercial activities. Finally, the report acknowledges that expanded global operations and evolving regulatory, environmental, data privacy and healthcare compliance requirements place significant demands on its managerial and operational infrastructure, requiring continual enhancement of corporate‐wide strategies, risk‐mitigation measures and governance processes to preserve organizational integrity and performance under challenging conditions.

The company’s annual report discloses that interruptions or delays in shipments, natural disasters, terrorism, pandemics such as COVID-19, geopolitical conflicts and trade wars pose significant risks to business continuity by placing “significant pressure on supply chain management, manufacturing, inventory and quality control management, shipping and trade compliance,” hindering its ability to forecast component supply, manufacturing capacity and timing of inventory receipts. It acknowledges that reliance on sole or limited sources for critical components increases vulnerability to supply shortages, extended lead times, price fluctuations and decommitments, which have led to “increased component prices, fewer sourcing options, unpredictability of supply, prolonged manufacturing disruptions and increased product lead times,” and that, although it has “increased purchase commitments and extended its demand planning horizon” and deployed additional working capital to support long-term customer demand, it may still face delayed or canceled orders, excess or obsolete inventory write-downs, or the need to redesign products. The report further describes the company’s dependence on third-party contract manufacturers and key merchant silicon vendors—leveraging their investments and expertise to focus its research and development resources on software core competencies—while warning of the “operational risks” arising from manufacturers’ capacity constraints, potential termination for convenience, intellectual property misappropriation, and the complexity, time and cost of qualifying alternate suppliers or facilities. It highlights the long and unpredictable sales cycles of large end customers, acceptance delays and variability in purchase timing and volume, which complicate demand forecasting, budgeting and revenue recognition, and notes how fluctuations in deferred product revenue and renewals of post-contract support services impact reported results. In addition, the company identifies cybersecurity threats, litigation exposures, export and import control requirements, and evolving regulatory obligations as sources of external pressure requiring robust risk mitigation, crisis management and contingency planning. Taken together, these disclosures outline the firm’s multifaceted resilience strategies—including demand planning, supplier diversification, purchase commitments, product redesign capability, collaborative resource allocation and close partner engagement—aimed at absorbing strain, maintaining system integrity and preserving or improving performance under challenging conditions.

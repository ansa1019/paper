In the face of a difficult market or economic environment, we may need to reduce fixed costs and other expenses in order to maintain profitability, including cutting back or eliminating the use of certain services or service providers, or terminating the employment of a significant number of our personnel that, in each case, could be important to our business and without which our operating results could be adversely affected, and a failure to manage or reduce our costs and other expenses within a time frame sufficient to match any decrease in profitability would adversely affect our operating performance.  Another pandemic or global health crisis like the covid-19 pandemic may adversely impact our performance and results of operations by causing labor shortages and disrupted global supply chains that contribute to prolonged disruption of the global economy and increase the possibility of periods of increased restrictions on business operations, which may adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition, and prospects materially and exacerbate other risks discussed.  In the event of another pandemic or global health crisis, our funds’ portfolio companies may experience decreased revenues and earnings, limited access to financing and constrained operations, which may in turn reduce our performance and cash flow, and our employees may become sick or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended period, with extended public health restrictions and remote working arrangements potentially impacting employee morale, integration of new employees and preservation of our culture, while remote environments may also be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks and our third-party service providers could be similarly impacted by pandemic-related restrictions or system failures.  Our operations are highly dependent on our technology platforms and analytical, financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems, and cyberattacks or other security threats could compromise our systems, resulting in business interruptions, financial loss, regulatory intervention, reputational damage and liability to our investment funds and investors.  A disaster or disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business, including electronic communications or cloud services provided by third parties, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate without interruption, and our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result.  More broadly, escalating energy prices and input costs have contributed to margin pressures on certain portfolio companies while rising interest rates and high inflation could impair their cash flows and financial condition, and significant chronic or acute physical effects of climate change, including extreme weather events such as hurricanes or floods, can also have an adverse impact on our funds’ real assets investments and on certain portfolio companies that rely on physical facilities, leading in some cases to increased capital expenditures, supply-chain changes and product or service redesigns to meet changing customer expectations.  In addition, non-governmental and governmental stakeholders have placed increasing emphasis on environmental, social and governance matters, and competing demands from different stakeholders with divergent esg views may impair our access to capital, constrain deployment opportunities or impact our reputation.  Our dependence on third-party service providers for administration, technology platforms and outsourced functions, over which we have limited control, exposes us to the risk of business interruptions, system failures and data compromises, and our reliance on complex licenses, concessions or contracts in certain jurisdictions increases the risk that regulatory changes or noncompliance may limit our ability to operate in those markets.  Finally, extreme market volatility, credit market dislocations and contracting liquidity could make it more difficult for our funds to sell assets at attractive prices or in a timely manner, which could lead to drawdowns for liquidity requests that may adversely affect the fees we earn and the returns we deliver to investors.

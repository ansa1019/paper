NEE and FPL face numerous internal and external pressures requiring the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions through comprehensive risk mitigation, resource reallocation and continuity measures. Specifically, the utilities implement storm funds, regulatory assets and cost recovery clauses to restore service and repair damaged facilities following hurricanes, winter storms and other extreme weather, including petitions to the Florida PSC for interim surcharges to replenish storm reserves. They invest in additional winterizing of critical equipment, modifications to plant operations and expansion of load-shedding options to preserve operational flexibility under severe conditions. A robust hedging program employing energy, interest-rate and foreign currency derivatives, combined with credit enhancements such as letters of credit and collateral management, is used to absorb market volatility, manage supply-chain disruptions and stabilize fuel procurement and power generation. NEE and FPL also continually add, modify and replace information technology systems to maintain transaction processing and safeguard against cyber and physical threats, while maintaining extensive insurance coverage and transmission or gas transportation arrangements to support rapid recovery and supply continuity. These strategic initiatives reflect the companiesâ€™ ability to adapt their capital deployment, operational management and inter-organizational collaboration to absorb strain, reconstitute functional trajectories and sustain performance and financial health amid regulatory, environmental, market and security disturbances.

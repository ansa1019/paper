AbbVie maintains operational continuity and adaptability by closely managing manufacturing and supply chain resources, monitoring distribution channel inventory, establishing allowances for credit losses and rebates, and adjusting its commercial and clinical trial operations in response to public health outbreaks, geopolitical events, regulatory changes and market disruptions. The company modified business practices during the COVID-19 pandemic—implementing preventive measures, safeguarding employee and partner well-being and ensuring uninterrupted patient access to essential medicines—and similarly adapted to the Russia-Ukraine conflict by suspending non-critical aesthetic operations while continuing to supply vital therapies under evolving sanctions. Following its Allergan acquisition, AbbVie executed an integration plan to reconfigure organizational structures, realize cost synergies and optimize resource allocation, incurring necessary severance and integration expenses to preserve long-term performance. The company fortifies resilience through diversified revenue streams, ongoing investment in research and development, strategic partnerships and licensing collaborations, proactive defense of intellectual property, compliance with complex global regulations, maintenance of liquidity via revolving credit facilities and debt refinancing, prudent share repurchase and dividend policies, rigorous risk mitigation protocols—including litigation reserve formation, business interruption insurance and cybersecurity measures—and continual reassessment of operational parameters to manage capacity constraints, raw material sourcing, third-party provider dependencies and pricing pressures.

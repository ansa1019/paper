The report emphasizes the company’s focus on business continuity and disaster recovery planning as essential components of its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, noting that “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.” It discloses that if the company “experiences a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, war or other geopolitical tensions, protests or riots, security breach, cyberattack … our ability to operate will depend, in part, on the continued availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations,” and acknowledges that vulnerabilities in third-party infrastructure, information systems and control systems—whether from natural disasters, cyberattacks, internal misconduct or supply-chain compromises—could interrupt services, compromise sensitive data and require significant expense to remediate. To mitigate these risks and maintain operational flexibility, the company states that “we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession,” and that it invests in technology infrastructure, strategic partnerships and security enhancements—such as access controls, patch management and encryption—to support digital operations, manage cyber threats and respond effectively to technological change. The disclosure further highlights the importance of integrating acquired systems, maintaining corporate culture in a hybrid work environment, and securing business disruption insurance, all of which the company regards as critical to sustaining organizational health, preserving system integrity under internal or external variations, and enabling the firm to emerge stronger and more resilient from challenging situations.

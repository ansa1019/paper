Goldman Sachs maintains a comprehensive, firmwide resilience framework, overseen by its operational risk and resilience committee and embedded in policies for liquidity, funding, business continuity and crisis management, with the specific objective “to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances.”  The firm pre-funds potential cash and collateral needs in a liquidity crisis by holding “unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash” as global core liquid assets (gcla), diversified across Group Inc., Funding IHC and its major broker–dealer and bank subsidiaries, and supplements these with cash balances in entities where liquidity transfer is restricted.  A detailed contingency funding plan identifies drivers of potential capital deficiencies and assigns mitigation actions, including coordination of information flow, liquidity maintenance activities and internal and external communication in a stressed environment.  Ongoing firmwide stress tests and intraday and 30-day liquidity models quantify exposures under combined market-wide and firm-specific shocks so that resilience strategies and risk mitigants can be adjusted in real time.  In parallel, the firm operates a firmwide control framework—refreshed through annual self-assessments and independent model reviews—designed “to minimize operational risks,” including technology, cyber-security and third-party dependencies, and a robust business continuity program “consistent on a firmwide basis” that incorporates regular testing of response and recovery strategies “with the objective of minimizing and preventing significant operational disruptions.”  This integrated approach to risk identification, scenario analysis, limit monitoring, and crisis response supports Goldman Sachs’s ability to adapt, reconfigure and preserve core functions under challenging conditions, in keeping with scholars’ definition of “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

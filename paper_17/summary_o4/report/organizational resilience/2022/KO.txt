The report describes how the Company contends with a wide range of operational shocks and external pressures—unfavorable economic and geopolitical conditions, civil unrest, acts of war and terrorism, trade sanctions and currency controls—that could lead to volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased input costs, labor shortages, temporary plant closures, production slowdowns and delays in sourcing key ingredients and packaging. It discloses contingency plans and productivity initiatives, including commodity hedging and vendor payment-term extensions, designed to preserve business continuity, manage resource allocation and mitigate risk. The suspension of operations in Russia and the disruption in Ukraine have heightened risks to employee safety, reputational risk and cyber incidents affecting information systems, requiring reconfiguration of operating models and crisis response measures. The COVID-19 pandemic has similarly tested the Coca-Cola System’s ability to absorb strain, prompting adaptations in channel mix, digital and e-commerce strategies, remote-work models and workforce planning to maintain performance under pressure and sustain customer engagement. Climate change, extreme weather, water scarcity, agricultural uncertainties and packaging-related regulations pose additional threats to system integrity and capacity; in response, the Company has set sustainability targets for water stewardship, recycled-content packaging and greenhouse gas reduction and applies environmental risk assessment and quality management standards to ensure operational flexibility and product safety. The report further explains how acquisitions, refranchising and integration of bottling partners are governed through transition support, aligned controls and performance management to absorb variability and drive positive adjustment. Finally, diversified financing sources, supply chain finance programs, receivables factoring, working-capital efficiency measures and strategic capital expenditures underpin liquidity resilience, enabling the Company to sustain its operating objectives and shareholder distributions in the face of adversity.

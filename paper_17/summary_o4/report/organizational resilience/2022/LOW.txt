The Company’s annual report describes numerous organizational capabilities, processes, and initiatives that support its ability to adjust positively under challenging conditions and preserve functioning despite internal and external disturbances. It emphasizes the need to adapt its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment by identifying and responding to shifts in customer habits, demographics, and sustainability expectations; deploying localized merchandise assortments; undertaking store maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives; and executing large-scale, integrated strategic programs—particularly those enabling an omnichannel sales and marketing presence. The report underscores reliance on associates, management, and contractors to develop new competencies and agility, as well as the importance of attracting and retaining skilled technology and retail professionals to realize transformational change. Supply chain transformation efforts, including a market-based delivery model and expanded fulfillment network, are presented as mechanisms to mitigate disruptions from pandemics, trade policy changes, weather-related events, and other hazards, while acknowledging that such investments may temporarily disrupt operations and may not deliver anticipated benefits. Technology and cybersecurity risks associated with a multi-year modernization of information systems are highlighted, with emphasis on maintaining, upgrading, and swiftly recovering systems to prevent data loss, operational interruption, or erosion of customer confidence. In addition, the Company outlines its self-insurance programs, vendor and third-party service provider management, and governance practices as elements of its risk management framework designed to maintain business continuity, operational flexibility, and performance under both nominal and extreme conditions.

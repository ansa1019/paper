The report discloses that the company has implemented and continually refines a range of measures to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, including near real‐time replication of production environments and customer data in separate facilities and “disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements” designed to reconstitute operations following equipment failures, natural disasters or public health emergencies. It notes the establishment of “enhanced processes and internal security controls,” regular briefings of the board’s cybersecurity and privacy committee and executive management on evolving cyber threats, and the ability to “escalate and respond to known and potential risks” as key mechanisms for mitigating the impact of security breaches, service interruptions or defects. To address capacity constraints and unexpected demand, the company emphasizes ongoing investments in data center and cloud-platform capacity, the scaling of personnel resources, continuous upgrades to internal systems and improvements in operational, financial and management controls, all intended to increase flexibility, support rapid reconfiguration of infrastructure and adapt to unanticipated service disruptions. The risks of interruptions or delays—whether from third-party providers, supply chain disruptions, natural disasters, geopolitical events, climate change‐related power outages or pandemic-related restrictions—are acknowledged as threats to service delivery and business continuity, and the firm highlights its ability to maintain and improve governance policies, disaster response plans and alternate service arrangements to preserve performance under pressure. The company further describes its January 2023 restructuring plan, which anticipates workforce and real estate adjustments to reduce operating costs and improve margins, as part of its broader strategy to enhance organizational flexibility and resilience in the face of macroeconomic volatility, customer buying delays, fluctuating foreign exchange rates and evolving regulatory and competitive pressures.

The Company’s disclosures underscore its ongoing efforts to preserve positive adjustment under challenging conditions by identifying and managing an extensive spectrum of internal and external pressures—ranging from macroeconomic volatility, currency and trade‐policy fluctuations, regional political instability, labor disruptions, natural disasters, extreme weather and acts of war to pandemics, cyber‐security incidents and supply‐chain interruptions—and by maintaining business continuity plans, diversified on‐the‐ground operations in some 70 countries, sole‐supplier and sole‐manufacturing arrangements, inventory safety stocks and rapid response protocols to reconstitute production and distribution in the face of unexpected events. The Company centralizes risk assessment and treasury functions to hedge interest rate, currency and commodity exposures, negotiates extended payment terms and operates a supply‐chain financing program to optimize working capital resilience, and maintains strong liquidity through cash generation, undrawn credit facilities and a commercial paper program. It deploys cross‐functional teams, leverages outsourcers under managed contracts, pursues focused productivity and organizational change initiatives—including strategic investments in environmental sustainability, digital capabilities, next‐level supply‐chain infrastructure and employee value—to enhance agility, operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration, and continuously refines governance, system redundancies, IT/OT security measures and crisis management protocols to safeguard system integrity, support rapid recovery and sustain performance under pressure.

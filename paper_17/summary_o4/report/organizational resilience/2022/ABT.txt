Abbott’s operational resilience is evidenced by its ability to manage a large and complex global supply chain—offsetting inflationary pressures and pandemic and geopolitical disruptions to maintain continuity of raw materials, services and manufacturing—while acknowledging uncertainty regarding future impacts. The Company invests in sophisticated information technology systems and data protection measures, monitors for current or potential threats and adapts to regulatory and technological changes to mitigate cyber risk and other operational disruptions. Significant resources are committed to research, development, strategic acquisitions, alliances, product innovation and business restructurings—such as the realignment of manufacturing networks in response to COVID-19 test demand and infant formula recall events—to reconstitute trajectories of supply and preserve performance under adverse conditions. Abbott’s dynamic approach to risk assessment and resource allocation aims to sustain effectiveness amid regulatory changes, cost containment initiatives and volatile demand, including the transition of COVID-19 to an endemic state, by applying gross margin improvement, pricing, and dividend and share repurchase policies. Financial and system resilience is further supported by prudent liquidity management, access to credit markets, working capital optimization and customer credit monitoring, although indebtedness and external pressures may constrain flexibility, underscoring the organization’s ongoing focus on strategic adaptation to maintain operational and financial health in challenging environments.

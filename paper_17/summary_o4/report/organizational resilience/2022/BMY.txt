Bristol Myers Squibb’s annual report acknowledges that a wide range of internal and external pressures, from regulatory changes and pricing constraints to supply-chain disruptions and cybersecurity threats, “could significantly and negatively affect our business operations, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, prospects, reputation or credit ratings,” underlining the need for the “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.” The company expressly anticipates and seeks to mitigate strain by relying on suppliers, vendors and alliance partners to “research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, co-promote and sell our products” while recognizing that the “failure of any critical third party to satisfactorily meet its obligations, including for future royalty and milestone payments; to adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis; and/or to satisfactorily resolve significant disagreements with us…could have a material adverse impact on our operations.” Cybersecurity is managed as a systemic risk, with the business noting that a “significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure” could undermine operations and explaining that it “has invested in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices of our data and IT … and continue[s] to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats,” albeit with limits to available insurance coverage. Liquidity and capital resources are addressed through forward-looking assessments in which management “regularly assess our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage ratio levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions in order to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions,” and by maintaining cash, marketable securities and backup facilities sufficient “to satisfy our anticipated cash needs … including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, income taxes, restructuring initiatives, business development and acquisitions, repurchase of common stock, debt maturities of approximately $10.6 billion through 2026.” Compliance with an SEC consent order further enforces operational continuity by limiting sales to direct customers to “expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand,” establishing a “formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports,” creating a business risk and disclosure group, and retaining outside consultants to “comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes.” The strategic framework combines “the resources, scale and capability of a large pharmaceutical company with the speed, agility and focus on innovation typically found in the biotech industry,” leverages post-acquisition synergies to streamline G&A, R&D, manufacturing and procurement, and embeds an ESG strategy “to drive resiliency and manage nonfinancial risks” by minimizing environmental footprint, advancing health equity and supporting community sustainability. Capital expenditure plans, expansion of manufacturing capabilities, a diversified R&D pipeline and disciplined portfolio management illustrate the company’s efforts to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve or improve functioning, even under extreme or exceptional conditions.

In our 2022 Form 10-K, we describe how organizational resilience is underpinned by our comprehensive operational and risk management practices designed to absorb internal or external pressures and maintain continuity of critical functions under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. We acknowledge that our computer systems, data management, internal processes and third-party dependencies are integral to performance and may be disrupted by natural disasters, cyberattacks, pandemics, civil unrest or infrastructure failures, and we mitigate these risks through regular system updates, backup systems, training, contingency funding plans, capital contingency and financial recovery routines, and disaster-recovery arrangements. A board-approved enterprise risk framework, supported by senior-management governance and an identify-measure-monitor-control process, integrates strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks, with defined risk appetite limits, model validation standards and independent audit and compliance oversight. We conduct daily value-at-risk and scenario analyses for trading and banking activities, stress-testing interest rate, liquidity and market shocks, and employ hedging strategies in derivatives and securities to manage interest rate, foreign exchange and credit exposures. Our liquidity management relies on high-quality, liquid assets, diversified secured and unsecured funding sources, and a centralized funding approach that supports business continuity and capital planning under CCAR, liquidity coverage and net stable funding requirements. A multilayered global information security program, combined with robust business continuity governance, ensures the security, reliability and adequacy of our systems, while contingency funding and recovery plans outline monitoring, escalation and resource-reconfiguration procedures—ranging from asset sales to capital issuances and internal capital transfers—to preserve system integrity, protect customer services and sustain organizational strength and flexibility.

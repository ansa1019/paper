Several disclosures in Nike’s 2022 Form 10-K describe practices and risks closely aligned with organizational resilience, emphasizing the maintenance of performance and integrity under adverse conditions. Management asserts that the diversity of operating locations, scale, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and robust information technology systems and networks position the company to withstand disruptions, while acknowledging that simultaneous or extensive events may still cause operational challenges. The report notes that extreme weather, natural disasters and governmental or public health measures in response to COVID-19 have in the past and could in the future temporarily disrupt operations, logistics and demand, prompting the company to balance inventory across geographies, employ seasonless product strategies and make assumptions about pandemic duration, severity and macroeconomic impacts for operational, financial and tax planning. Supply chain constraints arising from factory shutdowns, container shortages, labor shortages and inflationary input costs are identified as hazards requiring continual adjustment of sourcing, transportation methods and inventory levels to avoid write-downs or shortages that could impair margins and cash flows. To mitigate financial volatility, Nike details a foreign exchange risk management program that leverages natural portfolio offsets, derivative hedges of transactional exposures and translation hedges of net investments, together with maintenance of substantial cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and committed credit facilities to meet foreseeable domestic and foreign capital needs. The company also warns that any failure, inadequacy or interruption of critical information technology systems used across product design, forecasting, manufacturing, distribution, digital commerce and financial reporting could impede product fulfillment, customer service and new infrastructure deployment, underlining the necessity of resilient digital and supply chain architectures. Additionally, forward ordering practices, endorsement contracts subject to performance contingencies and high fixed-cost retail and digital investments are monitored continuously to sustain the company’s ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences, competitive pressures and legal or reputational risks, thereby preserving core capabilities, stakeholder trust and overall business continuity in the face of environmental, market and regulatory perturbations.

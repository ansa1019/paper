Lockheed Martin states that it seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to its business, acknowledging that risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted, and believes that its diverse range of products and services generally makes it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will affect the business on a long-term basis. The company seeks to manage raw materials supply risk through long-term contracts, identifying domestic or allied alternative sources, increasing visibility into its multi-tiered supply chain and maintaining an acceptable level of key materials in inventory, and may enter into long-term supply agreements to ensure availability at known unit prices. To remain competitive and agile, Lockheed Martin must maintain consistently strong customer relationships, seek to understand customer priorities and provide advanced technology solutions and services at an affordable cost with the agility required to satisfy mission objectives in an increasingly price-competitive environment. Its future success in delivering innovative and affordable solutions relies in part on a multi-year business transformation initiative to significantly enhance digital infrastructure, increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout the business while reducing costs, as well as on strategic investments in emerging technologies and collaboration with commercial entities. Recognizing the impact of COVID-19, the company has accelerated payments of $1.5 billion to its suppliers—prioritizing small and at-risk businesses—to mitigate supply chain disruptions and will continue to monitor supply chain risks and utilize accelerated payments on an as-needed basis. An extensive global security organization, including a computer incident response team and a corporate-wide counterintelligence and insider threat detection program, is in place to defend against cyber and other security threats, and threat intelligence is shared with defense industrial base peers, government agencies and cyber associations. The company’s ability to perform under contracts and execute new or growing programs depends on its success in identifying, attracting and retaining a highly skilled workforce with requisite technical skills and clearances, on processes for management transition and knowledge transfer, and on its ongoing evaluation of portfolio shaping through strategic acquisitions, divestitures, partnerships and equity investments. Financially, Lockheed Martin maintains a balanced cash deployment strategy, actively manages debt maturities and interest rates, and believes that its cash and cash equivalents, expected cash flow from operations and access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet cash requirements and support organizational continuity and resilience.

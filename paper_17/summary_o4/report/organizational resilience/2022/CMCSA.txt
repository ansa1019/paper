The Company’s disclosures illustrate multiple dimensions of organizational resilience—defined as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions”—through strategies to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity, whether competitive, technological, economic or environmental. In response to “highly competitive, consumer-driven, rapidly changing environments” and “changes in consumer behavior,” it “attempted to adapt our video service offerings, enhance our broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, and offer new programming, such as Peacock,” and is executing technology initiatives such as leveraging DOCSIS 4.0 to increase network capacity, while monitoring and mitigating supply-chain risks when “any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties” that “may adversely affect” service continuity. Cyber resilience is addressed by recognizing that “network and information systems … are critical to our business activities,” that “cyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving,” and that despite “extensive programs that seek to prevent security incidents” the Company “will continue to experience such incidents,” potentially causing degradation or disruption of network, products or services. The Company also acknowledges that “natural disasters, severe weather events … and … infectious disease outbreaks” have “in the past caused, and could in the future cause, a variety of adverse business impacts” requiring emergency repair and continuity planning. Its risk disclosures further cover intellectual property challenges, labor disputes, regulatory and economic volatility, foreign currency fluctuations and the need for liquidity and capital allocation to fund operations and strategic initiatives, reflecting a systemic perspective on adaptability, resource reallocation and performance maintenance under nominal, extreme or exceptional pressures in a multifaceted approach to resilience engineering and organizational transformation.

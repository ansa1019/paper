TIâ€™s global operations subject us to domestic and international political, social, economic and other conditions, including macroeconomic weakness, inflation, geopolitical tensions, acts of war, terrorism, health conditions and epidemics, climate change risks and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks, which may impact our ability to deliver products, support customers, receive manufacturing equipment or cause customers to seek alternate suppliers. We undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures, capital investments and restructuring actions, to support our objectives and strengthen our competitive advantages, while investing significantly in research and development and manufacturing capacity to improve production processes and diversify our product portfolio. We manage our operating plan and expenses with a steady hand, balancing inventory and production based on customer demand forecasts, and rely on cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable-rate, revolving credit facility to maintain liquidity and fund long-term resilience-enhancing initiatives, including investment tax credits under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. We also maintain comprehensive risk management processes for cybersecurity events, tax provisions, inventory valuation allowances, supplier performance and intellectual property rights to mitigate potential disruptions and preserve operational continuity. Despite demand volatility, market corrections and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including constrained supply and shifts in customer demand, we continue to monitor evolving risks, adapt our strategies and deploy resources to preserve performance and system integrity under both nominal and extreme conditions.

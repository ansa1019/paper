Since 2020, the life sciences solutions and specialty diagnostics segments as well as the laboratory products business have supported COVID-19 diagnostic testing, scaling and evolving their molecular diagnostics solutions and plastic consumables businesses to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; the biosciences and bioproduction businesses have expanded their capacity to meet the needs of pharma and biotech customers as they have expanded their own production volumes to meet global vaccine manufacturing requirements; and our pharma services business has provided our pharma and biotech customers with the services they needed to develop and produce vaccines and therapies globally. To address market slowdowns and uneven demand, we are pursuing strategies to improve internal growth, including strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets; allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects; developing new applications for our technologies; expanding our service offerings; continuing key customer initiatives; combining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets; finding new markets for our products; and continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to support cross-selling opportunities and take advantage of our depth in product offerings. Our proven growth strategy consists of three pillars: developing high-impact, innovative new products, leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging markets, and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. Productivity improvements from our Practical Process Improvement business system, including continuous improvement methodologies, global sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations, have been deployed to address inflationary pressures and enhance operational flexibility. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with projected operating cash flows and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of our businesses for at least the next 24 months. Nonetheless, our reliance on sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies if suppliers encounter financial or operating difficulties, and because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, work stoppages or price increases by those providers could disrupt product shipments and increase costs. Any significant disruption in, or breach of, our information technology systems or a violation of data privacy laws could interrupt our ability to quote, take orders and otherwise operate our business; our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for every eventuality, and despite any precautions, such failures could harm our reputation and financial results. Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events or events outside our control may disrupt our facilities or those of third parties on which we depend, impair critical systems or negatively impact customer spending, and evolving environmental, social and governance requirements require continuous monitoring of laws, regulations and stakeholder expectations to avoid noncompliance, loss of business, reputational harm, increased costs and potential attrition of top talent.

The company emphasizes that its available cash and cash equivalents, together with its capacity to generate operating cash flow and access to committed bank credit facilities and short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividends, debt repayments, milestone and royalty payments, and potential business development activities, and management continuously evaluates liquidity and capital resources to ensure adequate and efficient financing of its strategic initiatives; it has proactively invested more than $2 billion in new manufacturing facilities in Indiana, North Carolina, and Ireland and over $450 million in expanded capacity in Durham, North Carolina, to address tight supplies and strong demand for its incretin products, and it engages in various forms of collaborations, licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments to enhance its product pipeline and strengthen its business. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company undertook risk-at-risk investments in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibody therapies to ensure rapid global patient access, recognized net inventory impairment charges when demand and governmental agreements shifted, and continues to invest in research and development while managing its portfolio to absorb individual project delays without materially altering total R&D spending; it also maintains a controlled risk management program that employs derivative financial instruments to limit the impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings, undertakes compensatory actions to improve employee retention and address wage inflation, and retains discretion to terminate or adjust contingent milestone and royalty payment arrangements, viewing such obligations as positive indicators of successful progress. Actions to manage intermittent supply disruptions—such as measures to minimize patient impact in international markets—and the operationalization of additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity, coupled with hedging strategies to offset adverse currency and interest rate movements, demonstrate operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration, proactive planning and strategic foresight intended to preserve organizational functioning and performance under challenging internal and external conditions.

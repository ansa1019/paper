The company discloses that “the covid-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations,” reflecting the pressures of a prolonged crisis and the need to absorb strain and preserve functioning under exceptional conditions; it warns that “a breakdown of our information technology systems, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation,” noting that “we continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems”; the risk factors emphasize that “significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials” and that reliance on “third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components” creates vulnerabilities as “manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales”; natural disasters and climate change are noted when stating that “the effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations,” citing past hurricanes and earthquakes in Puerto Rico and resulting utility outages; the report further acknowledges that “global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business,” and that failure to comply with evolving regulatory requirements or to achieve environmental, social and governance objectives “may negatively affect our business and operations,” all of which underscore the company’s focus on risk mitigation, operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation necessary for positive adjustment under challenging, variable conditions.

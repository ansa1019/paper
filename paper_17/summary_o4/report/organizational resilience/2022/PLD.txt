The report discloses that the Company’s global operations are subject to myriad social, political, economic and environmental risks—ranging from regulatory and labor complexities to currency volatility, regional business cycles and civil unrest—and that it has established procedures and controls to monitor compliance with laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. It describes a natural hedging strategy of matching borrowings to the currency of foreign investments, supplemented by derivative financial instruments—including net investment hedges, foreign‐currency forwards and options, and interest rate swaps—to mitigate exchange rate and interest rate exposures, while acknowledging that these arrangements may not always be successful. Liquidity and capital resources are managed through diversification of real estate assets, co‐investment ventures, secured mortgage debt, credit facilities and strategic asset dispositions or contributions to ventures, enabling the Company to reallocate resources, adjust development and acquisition activities, and pursue alternative financing or liquidity measures—such as property sales, equity issuance or modified lease arrangements—when cash flow is constrained. The Company outlines its real estate development and redevelopment strategy, with disciplined build-to-suit programs and ongoing evaluation of construction costs, zoning and permitting risks, customer demand, market conditions and stabilization yields to maintain and enhance portfolio performance under varied scenarios. Comprehensive insurance programs covering property damage, rental loss, environmental liabilities, earthquake, hurricane and flood risks—subject to customary coverage limitations—and periodic self-insurance decisions are intended to preserve operational continuity under nominal and extreme conditions. Business continuity planning and crisis management protocols address global pandemics, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, cyber-security threats and system failures through redundancy, disaster recovery plans, security measures, third-party risk assessments and response procedures designed to protect critical systems and data. The report further identifies integration risks associated with property and entity acquisitions, liability exposures from environmental contamination, challenges in co-investment venture governance and financing, and the necessity of retaining key talent and robust disclosure controls to ensure compliance, preserve REIT qualifications and maintain organizational health. Finally, the Company acknowledges the prospective physical and transition risks of climate change—including evolving energy and emissions regulations and increased frequency of extreme weather events—and integrates these considerations into site selection, portfolio diversification, sustainable building practices and adaptive strategies to support the preservation of integrity, performance and long-term resilience in volatile markets.

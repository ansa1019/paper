The Companyâ€™s disclosure underscores its focus on maintaining integrity and performance under adverse conditions through a range of resilience-related strategies and structures.  These include ongoing supply-chain and manufacturing continuity planning in the face of natural disasters, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), geopolitical tensions and inflationary or currency pressures; the 2019 and 2023 global restructuring programs designed to simplify and optimize its manufacturing and distribution network, reallocate resources, build functional capabilities, achieve cost synergies and support strategic imperatives; dynamic monitoring of economic, regulatory and market dynamics to align expenses with revenues while preserving investments in research, development, capital and talent; stringent risk assessment and escalation frameworks for cybersecurity, legal, tax and product liability risks; and prudent liquidity and credit facility management to sustain cash flows, service debt obligations and fund acquisitions or reinvestments.  Together, these measures reflect an integrated approach to risk mitigation, operational flexibility and adaptive resource deployment intended to ensure business continuity, support strategic growth initiatives and enable the Company to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite external variations and disturbances.

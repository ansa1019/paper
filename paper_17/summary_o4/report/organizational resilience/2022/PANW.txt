In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19 and other global economic and geopolitical disruptions, we have taken measures intended to mitigate risk to our workforce and business partners, including Flexwork programs allowing employees to work remotely or on-site and ongoing monitoring of public health guidance that may necessitate policy adjustments. However, supply chain challenges such as semiconductor shortages and logistics delays have at times extended delivery times, increased costs, strained our manufacturing and operational resources, and complicated our ability to forecast results, prompting us to reprioritize engineering and R&D investments, reconfigure our original offering roadmap, and expand our IT and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and controls to manage future growth effectively. To sustain business continuity, adaptability, and service innovation, we rely on a global channel partner network, outsourced manufacturing relationships, cloud hosting services, and forward foreign-currency contracts, each of which introduces risks to quality assurance, product availability, support, and financial performance and requires us to maintain robust forecasting, inventory management, and credit-risk monitoring processes. We continue to invest in our technical support capabilities, monitor credit exposure of partners and end-customers, and, where necessary, expedite or reallocate components to preserve our performance under pressure and maintain integrity in the face of internal and external variations and disturbances. Additionally, in connection with our debt obligations, contractual commitments, and corporate governance provisions, we continually assess our capital structure, contingent liabilities, and contractual obligations to ensure we retain the operational flexibility, strategic agility, and resourcefulness needed to adapt, recover, and emerge stronger from adversity or exceptional conditions.

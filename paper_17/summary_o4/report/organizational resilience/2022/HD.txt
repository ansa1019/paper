The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize its ability to maintain performance under pressure by leveraging strategic investments in its supply chain and interconnected retail capabilities to enhance customer experience and competitive advantage, managing inventory levels and vendor payment timing to mitigate global supply chain disruptions and promote higher in-stock availability, and adapting fulfillment, delivery and pickup options in response to evolving consumer needs, economic conditions, and unexpected weather or public health events. Executing the interconnected retail strategy entails continual investment in operations and information technology systems, development of new processes and support systems, and maintenance and reallocation of its store network to preserve operational continuity and address facility aging, shrink and safety risks. The Company also relies on expanded commercial paper and credit facilities, disciplined capital allocation—prioritizing business reinvestment, dividends and share repurchases—and access to the long-term debt markets to preserve liquidity and flexibility, while managing lease, purchase and tax obligations. To guard against disruptions, it implements redundancies and security measures in its IT infrastructure, regularly reviews cybersecurity controls, and maintains contingency plans for system failures, natural disasters, labor shortages, supplier challenges, regulatory changes and other external pressures. Strategic transactions, supplier alliances and proprietary product development are managed through structured integration processes, responsible sourcing audits and contract negotiations to sustain product quality, availability and margin performance. Through these mechanisms—ranging from risk assessment and mitigation, crisis response protocols and operational flexibility to capital management and organizational change processes—the Company seeks to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

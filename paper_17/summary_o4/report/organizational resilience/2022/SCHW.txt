Schwab’s annual report describes a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework designed to preserve the firm’s integrity and performance under both nominal and stressed conditions, including clearly defined governance bodies such as a global risk committee and functional sub-committees, periodic risk‐control self-assessments, internal audit reviews, and detailed reporting and escalation protocols. The company maintains systems and procedures—back-up and recovery infrastructure, geographically dispersed workforces, business continuity and disaster-recovery plans, incident management processes, and third-party risk oversight—to ensure operational continuity in the face of cyber threats, system outages, natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical events, and other disruptive events. Schwab actively manages credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, and conduct risks through policies, controls, stress testing, early-warning indicators, contingency funding plans, capital contingency plans, capital and liquidity coverage ratio monitoring, secured credit facilities, and diversified funding sources, all within approved risk appetites. The firm also describes strategic responses to rising interest rates via balance sheet and derivative instruments, careful integration and resource planning for acquisitions, ongoing investments in technology and staffing to support client service, and incentive‐compensation oversight, reflecting its ability to adapt, reconfigure resources, and maintain functionality and client engagement through external pressures, environmental perturbations, and extreme market conditions.

S&P Global’s Annual Report on Form 10-K describes a range of risks and mitigation efforts that speak directly to the company’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. It highlights cybersecurity and technology risks—from common attacks to sophisticated, state-sponsored intrusions—that could interrupt secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential data, compromise system integrity and cause material interruptions in websites, applications or data processing; it notes that vulnerabilities in third-party software and vendor systems require ongoing remediation yet may nonetheless result in breaches that damage reputation, disrupt operations and increase regulatory or litigation exposure. The report further acknowledges exposure to physical and technological infrastructure failures—due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications outages, sabotage, terrorism, civil unrest or war—that could impair critical databases, applications and electronic delivery systems; it confirms the existence of disaster recovery plans and backup facilities for primary data centers but admits that incomplete redundancy and the lack of restoration plans for non-essential services could leave certain locations or systems unable to service clients if a disruption occurs. Transition to cloud-based infrastructure is characterized as complex, time-consuming and potentially disruptive—any deficiencies in design, implementation or outsourced services could adversely affect normal operations—while outsourcing functions to third-party providers adds risks of non-performance, unauthorized access and compliance failures. The report also details the operational and managerial challenges of integrating IHS Markit post-merger—including significant costs, resource diversion and potential cybersecurity exposures—which may exceed anticipated cost and revenue synergies and strain the company’s capacity to adapt. Moreover, the company recognizes that pandemics, epidemics or public health crises such as COVID-19 may introduce volatility, restrict human mobility, limit its ability to interact with customers, delay renewals and new sales, and exacerbate economic uncertainty. In response, S&P Global states that it maintains policies, processes and internal controls to secure its IT environment, assess and mitigate risks, and preserve business continuity; however, it concedes that rapid threat evolution, changing regulatory landscapes across multiple jurisdictions and unforeseen disruptions may render such measures insufficient, thereby exposing the firm to material adverse effects on its operational flexibility, service delivery, system resilience, organizational health and long-term performance.

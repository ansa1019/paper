The report describes a range of external disturbances—volatile economic and political conditions, global health emergencies, cyberattacks, natural disasters, geopolitical tensions and supply‐chain disruptions—that can undermine client demand, disrupt communications and travel, impede access to remote and on-site delivery centers and threaten both the integrity of IT networks and the continuity of key processes. It emphasizes that our global delivery capability, concentrated in certain regions, along with our reliance on ecosystem partners and mobile, cloud-based infrastructures, must be supported by robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans and currency-hedging programs to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under both nominal and extreme conditions. The document further details the challenges of matching people and skills with changing client demand, managing workforce attrition and compensation inflation, and rebalancing or reconfiguring resources—including redeployment and subcontractor use—to maintain operational flexibility and profitability. It highlights the importance of institutionalizing knowledge, maintaining effective internal controls and corporate culture, implementing strategic foresight and change-management processes, and forging and managing alliances, acquisitions and joint ventures to enable rapid adaptation, mitigate risk, protect organizational health and sustain competitive advantage in an increasingly turbulent, interconnected business environment.

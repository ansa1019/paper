Merck is subject to a broad array of risks that could materially impair its ability to preserve or improve functioning under adversity, including dependence on key patent rights, sustained pricing and reimbursement pressures, exposure to global economic and geopolitical volatility, climate change, natural disasters, pandemics and cyber-attacks, each of which demands a systemic perspective, adaptive strategies and robust risk mitigation mechanisms to sustain operational continuity and firm performance.  The company monitors and seeks to mitigate interruptions to business continuity arising from the war in Ukraine, related sanctions, and pandemic-related disruptions by deploying cross-functional response teams to reconstitute supply chains, reconfigure clinical trial operations and ensure the continued delivery of essential medicines in crisis-affected regions.  Merck continues to adapt to macroeconomic headwinds and cost-containment measures by governments, which have introduced supply chain fragmentation, raw-material shortages and transportation delays, prompting investments in emergency management, resource reallocation and strategic resilience tools.  Recognizing that climate change presents both acute physical risks (extreme weather events, sea-level rise) and transition risks (new regulations, increased compliance costs), the company is upgrading facilities, improving site resilience and working with suppliers to maintain system integrity and resource availability.  With growing reliance on sophisticated software applications, cloud services and digital platforms, Merck has instituted continuous monitoring and reinforcement of its IT infrastructure and personnel practices to guard against disruptions from cyber-attacks, information breaches and evolving social media and mobile threats while leveraging innovation to enhance process efficiency.  The company also confronts evolving legal, tax and ESG requirements that impose additional constraints and stakeholder expectations, compelling organizational flexibility, future planning, dynamic capabilities and collaborative networks to sustain positive adjustment, competitive advantage and long-term viability in turbulent markets.

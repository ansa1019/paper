Stryker’s disclosures illustrate organizational resilience through risk mitigation and adaptation measures designed to preserve operational integrity and performance under adverse conditions, including global supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, geopolitical conflicts and pandemics. The Company recognizes that reliance on sole‐source suppliers for critical raw materials, components and services may expose it to shortages, price volatility and unanticipated cost increases that could impair manufacturing continuity and competitive positioning, and accordingly invests in alternative sourcing strategies, monitors and adjusts inventory and validates supplier processes under regulatory constraints. Stryker also deploys business continuity plans, incident response protocols and cybersecurity investments—including network and system monitoring, employee training and security policies—to safeguard critical information technology infrastructure and maintain data confidentiality, availability and integrity; it is currently implementing a new global ERP system to enhance order processing, product shipment, services and contractual fulfillment, with contingency planning to address potential implementation disruptions. The Company emphasizes talent management and workforce flexibility to support its innovation and service offerings, yet acknowledges the risk that failure to recruit, develop and retain key personnel or sustain inclusive culture in a remote/hybrid environment could impede strategic objectives. Concentrated manufacturing footprints are mitigated by contingency plans for facility damage or supplier unavailability, enabling rapid alternative production methods, though regulatory approvals may delay recovery and impact market share and reputation. Stryker continues to monitor the Russia–Ukraine war, China’s volume‐based procurement programs and the evolving macroeconomic environment shaped by COVID-19, acknowledging that ongoing volatility obliges continuous adjustment of operations, capital deployment and strategic market positioning to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and maintain growth and service delivery under challenging conditions.

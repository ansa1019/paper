The risk factors disclose that the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on us and the operations of many of our customers, including contributing to a curtailment of business activities, significant ongoing supply chain disruptions, economic uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets, the future impact of which will depend on evolving factors outside our control and to which we may not be able to effectively respond. To mitigate such disruptions and preserve continuity of operations under both nominal and extreme conditions, we have invested and expect to continue to invest in IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery plans, and we seek to mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our pricing strategy and periodic hedging transactions. We likewise monitor and manage foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures using derivative instruments to reduce market volatility, and we deploy a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation—maintaining significant cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and access to liquidity programs and capital markets—to support planned capital expenditures, pension contributions, transformation strategy costs, debt obligations and shareowner returns. We continuously adjust our network, workforce and production capacity through facility automation, strategic initiatives, productivity programs and the expansion of our digital access platform in order to preserve or improve functioning despite macroeconomic pressures, while our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy—which includes combining our integrated global network with digital capabilities and completing acquisitions such as Delivery Solutions and Bomi Group—demonstrates our ability to reconfigure resources, adapt to volatile markets, sustain performance under challenging conditions and emerge stronger from adverse events.

The Annual Report on Form 10-K details a range of practices and disclosures that reflect organizational resilience, including demand forecasting and production alignment to avoid “product shortages or build excess inventory that may need to be written off,” and the ability to “scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development efforts” in response to shifting market conditions. It describes operating new automated CAR T-cell therapy and retroviral vector manufacturing facilities where the Company “may require additional time and resources in order to effectively increase manufacturing capacity” and acknowledges that reliance on third-party sites and vendors “may delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts” or “result in product loss and regulatory action.” The report further addresses supply chain and logistics disruptions arising from epidemic or pandemic outbreaks, global currency fluctuations, regulatory inspections, anti-bribery compliance, natural or man-made disasters and political instability, all of which demand operational flexibility, risk mitigation strategies and contingency planning. It underscores the importance of maintaining robust supplier qualifications to ensure continuity of clinical trials and commercial supply, securing capital resources and liquidity—asserting that existing cash, marketable securities and credit facilities “will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future”—and sustaining third-party collaborations, cybersecurity protocols and skilled personnel to absorb strain, reconfigure operations and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external pressures.

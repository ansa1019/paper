The Company discloses that “our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues,” and acknowledges that it “devotes significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data” in response to “systems shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents.” It states that it manages commodity price risk “through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures,” and operates an integrated risk management framework—under the Board’s oversight and supported by an enterprise-level risk committee, divisional and market risk committees, a risk management office, internal audit, compliance & ethics and a disclosure committee—to “identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks” and coordinate mitigation efforts. Management further reports that it “continues to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations,” “continues to monitor the economic, operating and political environment,” and “continues to monitor changes in the retail landscape” in order “to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.” Finally, the Company has embarked on a strategic end-to-end transformation called pep+ (pepsico positive), which embeds sustainability and human capital at the center of its operations, advances productivity initiatives, capital investments in regenerative agriculture and circular packaging, and the build-out of e-commerce and digital capabilities, all aimed at absorbing strain, reconfiguring response trajectories and preserving or improving performance under challenging conditions.

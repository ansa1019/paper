Berkshire and its subsidiaries maintain business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate operational difficulties arising from cyber‐attacks, terrorist acts or other extreme events that could threaten human resources, production facilities and information systems. The company’s unusually decentralized business model and board‐approved succession plan, together with its diversified operating units and leadership by senior management in capital allocation, foster operational flexibility and positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Ample liquidity—reflected in substantial cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills—supports the organization’s ability to absorb external perturbations and preserve system integrity. In its insurance businesses, disciplined underwriting practices, including assessment of loss correlations, aggregation limits and catastrophe exposures, along with retained “float” for investment, exemplify resource deployment and resilience strategies designed to maintain performance despite adverse loss developments. The BNSF railroad and BHE utilities and energy businesses make significant ongoing capital investments to ensure continuity of critical transportation and energy infrastructure under extreme weather events, regulatory constraints and market volatility. Across manufacturing, service and retail operations, proactive responses to supply chain disruptions, input cost inflation and labor constraints—via production adjustments, pricing actions and cost control—demonstrate adaptive strategies and competitive advantage in turbulent markets. Equally, the maintenance of regulatory compliance, capacity for rapid risk assessment and the leveraging of financial resources underpin Berkshire’s multifaceted ability to withstand internal and external variations and sustain positive functioning.

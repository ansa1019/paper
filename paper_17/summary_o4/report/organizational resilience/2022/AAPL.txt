The company’s resilience framework encompasses proactive monitoring of evolving external pressures—from the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical and trade disputes to natural disasters and cybersecurity threats—and the deployment of adaptive operational measures, including system redundancy, business continuity and disaster recovery planning, even as it recognizes these measures may be insufficient for all eventualities. It continues to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with authorities’ recommendations, acknowledging that public safety measures, shifts in consumer demand and supplier disruptions have resulted in supply shortages, delays and inefficiencies. Following any interruption, the company may require substantial recovery time and incur significant expenditures to resume operations. To mitigate supply chain and pricing risks arising from single or limited sourcing and noncancelable manufacturing purchase obligations, it invests in manufacturing process equipment, makes prepayments under long-term supply agreements, builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments, and employs hedging strategies to address foreign currency and commodity exposures. The company secures its information technology systems and sensitive data through encryption, authentication technologies and multifactor authentication, continuously monitors for unusual activity and maintains insurance coverage, while noting such continuity measures and coverage may not address all potential disruptions. It also upholds comprehensive policies, procedures and controls for legal, regulatory and data protection compliance and positions substantial cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to satisfy its capital requirements and preserve operational flexibility and strategic agility in the maintenance of performance under challenging conditions.

The company’s annual report acknowledges that its operations “routinely encounter and address risks” that “could cause our future results to be materially different,” with these risks “amplified by the effects of global developments, conditions or events like inflationary pressures, the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic,” which have created “significant economic instability and uncertainty” of an extent that is “uncertain and difficult to predict.” It highlights the potential “disruption of services on which we rely to deliver our services to our customers,” the complexity of “resuming operations in our offices under a hybrid workplace model” that may “exacerbate security and execution risks,” and a disaster recovery framework that “may not account for all eventualities,” all of which threaten operational continuity and organizational health. The report emphasizes ongoing investments of “significant resources to develop our skills, tools and capabilities,” particularly in rapidly changing technologies such as AI and blockchain, and details strategic initiatives—acquisitions, divestitures and new business models—that carry risks of “inability to successfully integrate,” “disruption of our ongoing business,” and “distraction of management.” Further attention is given to vulnerabilities from natural disasters, climate change, cybersecurity incidents, third-party failures, evolving regulatory and data-privacy landscapes, and talent shortages. To mitigate these pressures and preserve performance under strain, the company points to measures including ISO 27001 certification of key systems, enhanced security controls and training, third-party oversight, disaster-recovery planning, hybrid-workplace strategies, and participation in programs like the Paycheck Protection Program—all designed to absorb adversity, maintain service delivery, and enable adaptive response and recovery under challenging conditions.

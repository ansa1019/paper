Operational risks, including those relating to third parties who provide services to us, may disrupt our businesses, result in losses or limit our growth. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems and on the systems of third parties who provide services to us, and a disaster, disruption, error or inability to operate or provide any of these services could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. Our business continuation and disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption, and most of our administrative personnel and our information system and technology infrastructure for the asset management business are located in our New York City office, so any disruption in the operation of, or inability to access, that office could have a significant impact on our business. We face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions and reliance on manual processes in certain circumstances; if any of these systems do not operate properly, are disabled or not appropriately updated, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our various investment vehicles, regulatory intervention, fines, sanctions or reputational damage. Cyber-security failures and data security breaches may disrupt or have a material adverse impact on our businesses, operations and investments. Our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact, including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Breaches in security could potentially jeopardize our, our employees’, our fund investors’, Global Atlantic policyholders’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our employees’, our clients’ or third parties’ operations, which could result in significant losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to our various investment vehicles, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Misconduct of our employees, consultants or sub-contractors or by senior management of portfolio companies in which we invest, even though we may be unable to control or mitigate such misconduct, could impair our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm. Public health crises, such as COVID-19, may continue to occur from time to time, which could directly and indirectly impact us and our portfolio companies by threatening our and their employees’ well-being and morale, interrupting business activities, supply chains and transactional activities, disrupting travel and negatively impacting the economies of the affected countries or regions; governmental measures instituted to slow transmission—including business closures, crowd-size limitations, stay-at-home orders, quarantines, heightened border controls and vaccination or testing mandates—could be reinstated in the future and adversely affect our and our clients’ operations. Global Atlantic depends on the performance of its third-party service providers, including distribution partners and agents, and their failure to perform in a satisfactory manner could negatively affect Global Atlantic’s reputation and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

Throughout 2022, we continued to use our Total Safety Culture, Courage to Care, Commit (coaching, observing, mentoring, and motivating with integrity and trust), and peer-to-peer programs to enhance employee safety and engagement, refining safety procedures and policies based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, and we further refined our proprietary software to evaluate train and route characteristics, enabling proactive intervention by our Operating Practices Command Center to prevent derailments and increasing the replacement of freight car wheels and steps to address human-factor yard derailments. To address network congestion, we aggressively hired and graduated 1,302 new train, engine, and yard employees; temporarily relocated employees to areas with the greatest need; added locomotives to the fleet in select locations; and reduced freight car inventory relative to carloads, although we recognize that, despite efforts to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, and enhance operations at yards and other facilities, surges in demand may exceed our planned capacity and give rise to service shortcomings. We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business and devote significant resources to protect our technology systems and proprietary data, yet acknowledge that despite designing systems to identify, prevent, or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks, there can be no assurance that such measures will fully prevent material adverse impacts or service interruptions. As a railroad with a vast network, we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena—potentially intensified by climate change—and although we undertake efforts to plan for these events, line outages and interruptions can still adversely affect our network. We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios to evaluate our ability to generate cash, inform our liquidity plans and activities, and maintain access to committed credit under our revolving credit facility and receivables facility, indicating sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes. Looking ahead to 2023, we strive to increase the reliability of our service product, reduce variability in network operations, improve resource availability by actively hiring additional train, engine, and yard employees and pursuing train-length initiatives to efficiently add incremental volume growth, and continue capital investments targeted to improve operational performance, handle more volume, and increase efficiency with fewer resources. We will continue employing a comprehensive safety management system approach—utilizing technology, hazard identification and risk assessments, employee engagement, training, quality control, and targeted capital investments—and will continually evaluate and adjust deployment of safety and operational resources to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. Our Operating Practices Command Center will further implement predictive technology to reduce variability by identifying causes of mainline service interruptions and developing solutions while assisting employees in understanding best practices for handling trains. Regardless of external factors, we will focus on providing our customers consistent and reliable service, efficiently managing operations, seeking new business opportunities, and protecting our employees, customers, and communities.

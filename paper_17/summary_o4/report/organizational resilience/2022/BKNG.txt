Our filings disclose that “our business and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties … which could adversely affect our business,” including “other events beyond our control such as terrorist attacks, extreme weather or natural disasters, wars and regional hostilities, travel-related accidents, or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel” whose impacts are “largely unpredictable” and “can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumers … any of which can adversely affect our business.” We warn that “if we are unable to successfully adapt to changes in how the travel industry operates or to changes in the ways in which consumers purchase travel services, our ability to compete … would be adversely affected,” and we emphasize the allocation of financial and human resources to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions through measures such as “redundant systems and hosting services,” “business continuity and disaster recovery practices,” and “the reliability and redundancy of our systems.” We describe ongoing investments in cyber-security to “protect against security breaches,” in mobile and connected-trip technology to support “operational flexibility” and rapid innovation, and in workforce capabilities to address intense “competition for well-qualified employees” and evolving consumer preferences. We recognize that resilience strategies must encompass inter-organizational collaboration, risk mitigation across third-party suppliers and payment processors, integration of acquisitions, adaptation to new regulatory regimes and digital services taxes, and the fulfillment of environmental, social, and governance commitments—factors essential to preserving system integrity, sustaining performance under pressure, and emerging stronger from both nominal and exceptional disturbances.

The company’s risk disclosures emphasize its need and ability to “adapt to technological changes and global trends” and to “continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers,” reflecting deliberate resource allocation toward ongoing enhancements and the shift to connected services to preserve operational continuity. It acknowledges reliance on third-party intellectual property and partnerships, identifying risks such as the “inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology, data assets and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures,” and the potential for “disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management.” Significant investments in information technology infrastructure, “network security and business controls,” and “disaster recovery planning” are described as measures intended to mitigate the effects of “business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems” and “major breach of our security measures,” which “could materially disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, significantly damage our reputation, subject us to costly litigation and cause material losses.” The firm further details an iterative risk assessment process—sharing information with federal and state agencies to counter fraud, enhancing security measures, and acknowledging that “such measures cannot provide absolute security”—while maintaining scalable systems to manage “extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods” in its tax business. In addition, compliance with evolving “privacy, data protection, data localization, and other laws” is highlighted as requiring adaptive operational changes and increased oversight, and the company recognizes that acquisitions and divestitures involve risks to organizational health—such as difficulty in transferring liabilities, retaining key employees, and transferring intellectual property. Collectively, these disclosures illustrate a systemic perspective on sustaining integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances by employing strategic foresight, operational flexibility, and resource reconfiguration to uphold organizational resilience.

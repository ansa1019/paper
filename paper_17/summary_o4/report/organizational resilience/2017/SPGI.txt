The annual report emphasizes the company’s reliance on robust business continuity plans and management succession to enable “the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations” under adverse conditions, while acknowledging that “a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas … could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.” It discloses that it “regularly assess[s] and take[s] steps to improve our existing business continuity plans,” maintains backup facilities and invests in “strengthening our digital infrastructure capabilities … with emphasis on workplace services and cybersecurity” to guard against system failures, data corruption and unauthorized access. The company further describes the risks of outsourcing, noting that performance failures by third-party service providers “could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm,” and underscores its maintenance of cash reserves and a $1.2 billion credit facility—with a covenant limiting its debt-to-cash-flow ratio—to ensure sufficient funding for operations, capital expenditures, debt service and strategic investments. It also details its approach to pension and postretirement benefit planning, stressing that assumptions are revisited as future events unfold, and explains its practice of recording liabilities for contingencies when it is “probable that a liability had been incurred … and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated,” including possible loss ranges. Taken together, these disclosures reflect the organization’s capacity to absorb strain, reallocate resources, mitigate risks, adapt to disruptions and preserve or restore performance under challenging or exceptional conditions.

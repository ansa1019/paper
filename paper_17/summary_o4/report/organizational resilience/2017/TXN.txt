The company identifies substantial competition that requires it to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures and to match inventory and production with customer demand in order to meet revenue forecasts, acknowledging that inaccurate forecasts may lead to inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory. It notes susceptibility to macroeconomic downturns, natural events, geopolitical and regulatory risks, cybersecurity threats that are frequent and constantly evolving, and transportation, communications and information technology disruptions, as well as fluctuating currency rates, all of which could disrupt operations or impair financial condition. In response, the company invests in manufacturing technologies and maintains in-house control of production to ensure consistent supply, achieve cost advantages through increased factory loadings and use of mature assets acquired ahead of demand, and allocate resources flexibly between manufacturing support, SG&A and R&D to drive innovation and product development. It relies on a diversified global footprint, multiple end markets, a broad product portfolio and a large sales force and web presence to reduce dependence on any single customer or region, and maintains relationships with multiple suppliers while monitoring quality, liquidity and supplier stability to mitigate supply chain risks. The company also emphasizes liquidity management through cash flow from operations, short-term investments, an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility, and disciplined capital allocation—evidenced by capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, dividend increases and share repurchases—supporting its assessment that it has the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and debt-related payments for at least the next 12 months. It undertakes acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring to support strategic objectives, applies due diligence and integration efforts to realize expected benefits, and manages tax, legal, compliance and warranty contingencies, all to preserve or improve functioning and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

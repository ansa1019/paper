The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize the importance of maintaining continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, noting that “risk factors … are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements,” and that “our operating results may fluctuate in future periods … as a result of numerous factors” such as demand volatility, sales-cycle shifts, inventory misalignment, rapid technological innovation and competitive pressures. To mitigate disruption, the Company describes “efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance” and expanded purchase commitments to secure constrained components, while balancing “the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence.” It highlights that operating expenses “are relatively fixed in the short term,” requiring “targeted cost reductions,” and outlines a strategic plan to “realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas” such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center, cloud and software, including a multi-year restructuring initiative intended to preserve or enhance functioning under adverse macroeconomic, geopolitical or operational disturbances. The report further details financing and credit programs for customers and channel partners, multi-year service and subscription offerings, and evolving business models—shifting to software and subscriptions and integrated solutions—that together reflect a systemic perspective on resource deployment, risk mitigation and adaptation to ensure business continuity and performance amid internal and external perturbations.

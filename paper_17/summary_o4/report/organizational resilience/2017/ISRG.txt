“Uncertainty about global economic conditions, including credit and sovereign debt concerns in certain European countries and concerns about slowed economic growth in China and other OUS markets, have caused and may continue to cause disruptions in the financial credit markets, volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs, concerns about inflation, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions, and liquidity concerns, and customers and distributors may choose to postpone or reduce spending due to financial difficulties or may be unable to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products, all of which could materially adversely affect our operations and underscore the need for effective risk mitigation and business continuity planning.  Economic and regulatory pressures—including healthcare reform initiatives in the U.S., changes to trade, fiscal, and tax policies (including tariffs and protectionist measures), and modifications to existing trade agreements such as NAFTA—could require us to adapt our product and distribution strategies and reallocate resources in multiple jurisdictions.  Because our markets are highly competitive and technological advances could make alternative treatments more effective or less expensive, rendering our products obsolete or unmarketable, we must continue to invest in innovation, research and development, and strategic response mechanisms to preserve or enhance our competitive position under pressure.  Reliance on sole and single‐source suppliers for critical components exposes us to supply disruptions, production delays, and cost increases, highlighting the importance of supply‐chain resilience and contingency planning.  Business continuity is further challenged by external hazards such as natural disasters, terrorist activities, cyber‐security threats, and epidemic diseases, which could divert medical resources, disrupt hospital admissions, or damage our own facilities and those of our suppliers, demonstrating the need for robust crisis management, operational flexibility, and coordinated support systems.  In addition, our operations are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements and inspections by agencies such as the FDA, the state of California, notified bodies in the EU, and other foreign authorities; failure to comply with quality system regulations, labeling standards, medical device reporting, field corrections, or import/export requirements can lead to enforcement actions, product recalls, import holds, or suspension of marketing authorizations, necessitating ongoing compliance programs, corrective and preventive actions, and continuous training of sophisticated personnel.  We have implemented programs to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents—employing encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data—and we maintain a hedging program designed to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Our global expansion and inter-organizational collaborations, such as the joint venture with Fosun Pharma to develop robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices, require careful coordination of strategic initiatives, resources, and governance structures to manage alliance risks and pursue future growth.  To sustain our integrity and performance under challenging conditions, we invest substantially in a broad set of research and development projects, maintain service contract commitments to ensure uninterrupted system support, and prioritize the attraction and retention of qualified management and scientific staff, reflecting our systemic perspective and dynamic capability to anticipate, confront, and benefit from unexpected disruptions.

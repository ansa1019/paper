UPS acknowledges that its operations are subject to a wide array of internal and external pressures—ranging from general economic cycles in over 220 countries and territories, changes in laws and regulations, fuel price volatility, labor disputes, cyber-security threats and data-protection requirements to severe weather events, natural or manmade disasters—and has implemented a broad set of measures to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions. The company continuously adjusts its domestic and international air and ground networks to match higher volume levels, deploying technology such as the ORION route-optimization system, automating and expanding facilities, and adding Saturday operations to sustain continuity. It manages currency and interest rate exposures through derivative instruments, hedges fuel price risk and implements dynamic fuel surcharges, and it forecasts capital needs—aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and equipment—while reallocating resources and cost structures in response to adverse economic conditions. UPS invests in technology security initiatives, information-technology risk management and disaster recovery plans to address evolving cyber threats and regulatory requirements, regularly moves data across borders in compliance with changing privacy laws and maintains self-insurance and high-deductible programs to mitigate liability. In confronting multiemployer pension uncertainties, Brexit-related instability, collective bargaining negotiations and potential regulatory shifts, the company evaluates contingent obligations, refines its funding strategies and secures operating flexibility, all with the aim of preserving organizational health, operational flexibility and strategic agility across its global logistics platform.

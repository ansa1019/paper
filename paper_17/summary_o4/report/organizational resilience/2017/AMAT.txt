Applied’s disclosures emphasize its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions by accurately forecasting demand and effectively managing resources, production capacity and costs across its businesses, “incurring unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations” where necessary; by maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory, “effectively managing its supply chain” and utilities, and attracting, retaining and motivating qualified employees during periods of increasing demand; by reducing costs, aligning its cost structure with prevailing market conditions and motivating and retaining key employees during periods of decreasing demand; by adapting to “uncertain global economic and business conditions” and related financial market uncertainties that may prompt customers or suppliers to delay or cancel orders, impair suppliers’ ability to deliver parts or scale back operations, and thereby require Applied to transfer business to alternative sources or absorb higher costs; by addressing natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest and other “events beyond Applied’s control” that may interrupt manufacturing or services and necessitate business continuity measures; by implementing new enterprise resource planning and related information systems to better manage operations while acknowledging the risk of “interruptions in service and operational difficulties” that could affect order tracking, supply-chain management, inventory forecasting and financial reporting; by maintaining credit facilities, managing debt obligations and preserving access to liquidity to mitigate changes in credit ratings or interest rate environments; by instituting an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and customer‐specific issues and adjusting it as necessary to reflect changing collectability risks; and by employing risk management, regulatory compliance, cybersecurity protections and strategic investments to sustain integrity, adaptability and performance under internal and external pressures.

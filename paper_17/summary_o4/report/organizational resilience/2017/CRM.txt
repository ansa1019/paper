The Company describes a range of measures and resources intended to enable the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including its ability to “maintain and improve business and data governance policies and processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks,” and a suite of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements under which “our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere,” with “certain offerings … served through alternate facilities or arrangements.”  It acknowledges that despite these precautions its services remain “vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events,” as well as “break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism,” or “an act of terrorism,” and that “significant recovery time could be required to resume operations.”  To reduce the risk of “performance degradation or service outages,” it commits additional infrastructure capacity, “upgrades or replaces various software systems” to scale operations, invests in security measures to mitigate evolving breach techniques, and defers—and amortizes—commission and data center costs over multi-year subscription terms to align resource deployment with contractual service periods.  It further emphasizes crisis management and disaster response plans for “natural disasters or other catastrophic events,” recognizes environmental perturbations such as climate change as a potential source of “losses and additional costs to resume operations,” and has implemented sustainability and resilience initiatives—ranging from a carbon-neutral cloud to on-site water recycling—to preserve system integrity, ensure operational continuity and support its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning in the face of adversity.

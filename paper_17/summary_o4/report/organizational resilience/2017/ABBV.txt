Abbvie’s annual report describes how the company identifies and responds to risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect its operations, financial condition or cash flows and thus require robust business continuity and risk mitigation measures; it relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection and normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents through litigation; it acknowledges that its highly exacting and complex manufacturing processes may face disruptions from equipment malfunctions, protocol deviations, raw material issues, facility constraints, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors and recognizes that failures to detect such issues before product release could lead to recalls, liability costs, product shortages, increased costs and damage to customer relations; to mitigate supply chain vulnerability associated with single-source suppliers, Abbvie carries business interruption insurance and monitors these relationships to ensure timely delivery; it monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government funding, establishes allowances for doubtful accounts, and utilizes factoring arrangements to manage credit risk; the company relies on sophisticated information technology systems, invests in data protection, and conducts ongoing monitoring to guard against malicious intrusion, data breaches or breakdowns; Abbvie’s operations are subject to rigorous international regulatory requirements, and it incurs substantial expense and management attention to ensure compliance, navigate possible governmental actions that could necessitate business modifications or production interruptions, and fulfill obligations under government settlements through enhanced controls, reporting and monitoring; the company manages financial resilience by maintaining sufficient flexibility to issue debt, negotiate financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms, assessing non-cancelable operating lease and purchase commitment obligations, and remeasuring contingent consideration liabilities—reflecting updated probabilities of milestone achievement, discount rates and market assumptions—to align its strategic acquisitions with evolving priorities; Abbvie further emphasizes ongoing investment in its research and development pipeline, strategic collaborations, and market launches, as well as voluntary contributions exceeding $750 million to pension and post-employment benefit plans, expansion of operating margins, dividends, and time-unconstrained stock repurchase programs, all as integral to sustaining operational continuity, adaptive capacity and long-term organizational resilience in a dynamic and uncertain business environment.

The report describes the company’s efforts to “absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity” through comprehensive business continuity and disaster-recovery planning, warning that “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.”  It identifies a broad array of “business continuity events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber-attack, power loss or telecommunications failure” and stresses that operational resilience depends on “the continued availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations.”  The company acknowledges that a “cyber-attack or other business continuity event affecting us or a key vendor or other third party could result in a significant and extended disruption in the functioning of our information technology systems or operations,” requiring “significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues,” and that “the inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our business.”  To mitigate these risks, “we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession,” provide “employee training (including phishing prevention training), procedures and technical safeguards,” and maintain service-level agreements with a large network of vendors.  The company also employs “case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group, and other methods to estimate potential losses” for errors and omissions claims, establishing and adjusting liabilities quarterly.  It highlights the importance of strategic agility and investment—“we must continue to invest in new technologies and new ways to deliver our products and services”—and of cultural resilience, noting that “failure to maintain our corporate culture or damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect” on the ability to attract, retain and mobilize key colleagues, safeguard critical knowledge and sustain performance under pressure.

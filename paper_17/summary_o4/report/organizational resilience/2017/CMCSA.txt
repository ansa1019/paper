Comcast’s businesses operate in “intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments” and face “a wide range of competition,” which has driven the company to seek ways “to enhance the value of our cable services network,” including growing high-speed Internet and business services and launching security and automation services, thereby flexibly allocating resources to preserve and improve functioning under competitive and technological pressures. In response to “changes in consumer behavior driven by online distribution platforms,” Comcast is “attempting to adapt its video service offerings” by deploying its X1 platform and cloud DVR technology, adding apps, customizing programming packages and introducing virtual multichannel offerings to reconstitute its service trajectories toward the evolving market. Recognizing that “network and information systems and other technologies … are critical to our business activities,” the company “develops and maintains systems, and operates an extensive security program” to mitigate “cyber threats and attacks” and other disruptive events such as power outages and natural disasters, thereby supporting recovery, ensuring operational continuity and maintaining performance under adverse conditions. Through proactive regulatory compliance, strategic spectrum acquisitions, diversified service offerings, significant capital expenditures in scalable infrastructure and line extensions, and periodic business initiatives including the launch of a wireless phone service, Comcast exemplifies the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions by absorbing strain, deploying resources toward innovation and preserving system integrity and performance amid internal and external disturbances.

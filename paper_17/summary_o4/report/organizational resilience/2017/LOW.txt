We have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business and administer risk mitigation controls and procedures under the oversight of our chief financial officer to preserve continuity and performance under internal or external disturbances.  We acknowledge that adapting our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address changing shopping habits, demands and demographics is critical to sustaining functioning and competitive advantage, and that the success of our omni-channel, change, growth and productivity initiatives requires integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing, new competencies, talent development and resource reallocation.  Our customer-facing technology systems and fulfillment networks, supported by disaster recovery plans, are designed to absorb strain, maintain integrity and provide a consistent experience despite cyber-attacks, system failures, power outages, supply chain disruptions, trade policy shifts, natural disasters, pandemics and other unexpected events.  We regularly consider strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures, and recognize that delivering the expected benefits depends on successfully integrating personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems, managing complexity in our financial controls and avoiding fragmentation of operations.  We employ self-insurance programs for workersâ€™ compensation, general and product liability and extended protection plan risks, maintain internal controls for reliable and accurate financial reporting, and manage third-party vendors and installers to mitigate legal, operational and reputational hazards.  We also maintain credit facilities, liquidity planning and compliance programs to ensure adaptive capacity, regulatory adherence and operational continuity, thereby enabling us to survive, grow and flourish under challenging conditions.

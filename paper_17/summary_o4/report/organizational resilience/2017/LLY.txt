The Company emphasizes maintaining a continuous flow of successful new products and indications sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies, and it manages research and development spending across its portfolio of molecules so that a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in total R&D spending. In the normal course of business, operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, and the Company addresses a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments; in particular, it strives to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to maintain that balance, and it may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating exchange rates. A great deal of confidential information is stored in its information systems and those of third parties, and maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its IT systems is vital to the business, so the Company has implemented measures to prevent, detect, respond to, and minimize vulnerabilities, security breaches, and operational failures, while recognizing that these measures may not be entirely successful. The Company also believes that cash provided by operating activities, along with available cash and cash equivalents and unused committed bank credit facilities, should be sufficient to fund normal operating needs—including capital expenditures, installment payments of the U.S. transition tax, dividends, share repurchases, and debt reduction—and it continues to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment, the creditworthiness of its customers and suppliers, and various legislative and regulatory developments. Voluntary early retirement programs and other cost-structure reduction initiatives, together with ongoing integration and asset‐rationalization efforts, further serve to preserve financial flexibility and operational continuity under adverse conditions.

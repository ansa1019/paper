The Company acknowledges that certain factors may have a material adverse effect on its business continuity and its ability to maintain functioning and performance under challenging or extreme conditions, including the failure to retain or add active users, technical or other problems that prevent rapid and reliable delivery of its products, security breaches, cyber-attacks, system failures or outages, interruptions in network infrastructure, and unexpected changes in third-party mobile operating systems, networks, or standards. In order to absorb strain and preserve performance despite such internal or external disturbances, the Company allocates significant resources to expand and scale its technical infrastructure and data center capacity, invest in robust security measures and content review processes, and enhance its operational flexibility. It also frequently makes product and investment decisions that do not prioritize short-term financial results if they are expected to improve the aggregate user experience and thereby strengthen long-term financial performance, such as changes to news feed ranking algorithms, ad formats, and the balance of ad prominence versus user engagement. The Company pursues strategic acquisitions to add specialized talent, complementary technologies, and intellectual property, and devotes resources to integrating these acquisitions to avoid operational fragmentation and support business continuity. To manage the multifaceted risks of litigation, regulatory inquiries, and evolving privacy, data protection, and content requirements, the Company maintains compliance programs, vigorously defends its intellectual property, and adapts its policies and practices in response to legal developments and stakeholder expectations. The Company continually monitors its key performance metrics, refines its risk assessment processes, and develops crisis response mechanisms to reconstitute its operational trajectories in the immediate aftermath of disruptive events and to reconfigure its resources and strategic initiatives toward a stronger future state.

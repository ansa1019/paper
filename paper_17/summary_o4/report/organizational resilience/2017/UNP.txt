The report describes a broad range of strategies, processes and investments that underpin the company’s capacity to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.  In its risk‐factor disclosures, the company highlights its ongoing efforts to manage fluctuating demand and network capacity—resizing operations, adjusting work‐force levels and allocating adequate resources to address surges in demand, weather‐related events and other internal or external variations that could compromise service continuity.  It emphasizes continual enhancements to its transportation plan, yard and facility operations, capacity expansion projects and technology systems (including positive train control and transportation control systems) to ensure operational flexibility, network fluidity and surge capability of its assets.  The company’s multi‐faceted safety initiatives—inclusive of risk assessment strategies, targeted capital investments, defect detection, crossing improvements, training programs and employee engagement through “total safety culture” and “courage to care”—reflect a systemic perspective on risk mitigation, recovery and organizational health.  Liquidity and capital resource disclosures underscore the maintenance of diversified funding sources and a revolving credit facility to support business continuity under economic perturbations, while the 2018 capital plan prioritizes renewals of critical infrastructure, capacity investments and technology improvements to strengthen resilience against future disruptions.  The company further identifies risk‐management practices in hazardous‐materials transport, cyber‐security, environmental remediation and regulatory compliance as essential mechanisms for preserving integrity and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

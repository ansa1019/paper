The company routinely addresses a wide array of disruptions to its organizational integrity and performance, noting that its businesses “routinely encounter and address risks,” including regulatory changes that may “require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business,” and maintains “disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events,” while acknowledging that such plans “may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.”  To preserve functioning under evolving threats, the company “devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes,” and has “programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents,” recognizing that “techniques used to obtain unauthorized access … may be difficult to detect,” and that hardware and software defects “could compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems.”  It “relies heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems” and hosts critical applications in both company‐operated and third-party data centers, with contingency plans to address “bank failures” or “systemic shutdown of the banking industry” that could impede “our ability to process funds.”  Financial continuity is supported by a diversified investment strategy that “seeks to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income” through laddered maturities of investment‐grade securities and money market holdings, and by short-term financing arrangements—such as a $9.5 billion commercial paper program, reverse repurchase agreements and committed credit facilities—to ensure liquidity for both corporate needs and funds held for clients; credit quality, maturity and exposure limits are applied to mitigate interest‐rate and credit risk.  The company also implements and continually enhances risk-based compliance programs addressing anti-corruption, anti-money-laundering and trade sanctions, recognizing the potential for heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement.  Through these investments in operational flexibility, resource allocation and risk mitigation mechanisms, the company seeks to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of internal or external disturbances.

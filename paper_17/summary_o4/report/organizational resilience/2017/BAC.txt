Bank of America’s disclosures emphasize its commitment to preserving core operations and “business continuity” under adverse conditions by maintaining robust contingency plans, stress‐testing its balance sheet and liquidity sources, and upholding capital and liquidity buffers sufficient to absorb shocks and fund commitments for extended periods.  The firm “continuously update[s] the systems on which we rely to support our operations and growth” and has established enterprise‐wide policies and procedures—including contingency funding plans, recovery and resolution planning under a single point of entry strategy, and a diversified funding and liquidity framework—to ensure it can meet contractual and contingent obligations even under severe market stress or credit‐rating downgrades.  It employs a systemic risk‐management framework with clear risk appetites and limits, backed by active monitoring, hedging and risk mitigation techniques, to reconfigure resources and respond adaptively to evolving economic, regulatory, operational or cyber threats.  In addition, dedicated operational and compliance risk programs, regular model validations and independent testing, and ongoing “stress forecasting” of income and capital serve to safeguard critical functions, allocate resources dynamically, and support the organization’s ability to “absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.”

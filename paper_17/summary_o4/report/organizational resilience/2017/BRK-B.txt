Berkshire and its subsidiaries are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations, and we are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions, such that if the services of our key personnel were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations; however, Berkshire’s board of directors has identified capable subsidiary managers and established a succession plan that the board continually monitors and could alter, which, together with the outstanding managers running our highly diversified operating units, helps to mitigate this risk and preserve operational continuity. We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis with minimal involvement by our corporate headquarters in day-to-day activities, and we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future operations due to changing business or regulatory environments, reflecting an adaptive organizational structure. We believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and insist on safety over yield, continuing to hold significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills, and we strive to protect our large statutory surplus as a competitive advantage while acknowledging that concentrated investments may produce significant fair-value volatility and potential declines in surplus, thus addressing the balance between resource concentration and risk mitigation. In our information technology operations, we have implemented business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate cyber security risks, recognizing that significant disruptions or failures could result in service interruptions, safety or security failures, and other operational difficulties. Competitive pressures, technology changes, normal economic cycles, restricted access to debt capital, regulatory changes, terrorist acts and other external pressures are identified as factors that may erode business franchises, reduce earnings or impair capital access, and accordingly we develop and strengthen competitive advantages, decline business when prices are inadequate, and conduct risk assessment and resource allocation to adapt and protect our operations under varying conditions. Our insurance businesses view underwriting operations as distinct from investing, seek to generate underwriting profits in most product lines, re-estimate liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, and amortize deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts over expected settlement periods, reflecting dynamic reserving and reconfiguration of financial resources to maintain integrity and performance under catastrophic and long-tail casualty events. Our railroad and utilities and energy businesses monitor general economic conditions, plan significant ongoing capital investments to ensure safe and timely service, maintain access to borrowed funds at reasonable rates, and adapt to prepayment and debt market disruptions to preserve reliable operations. Manufacturing, service and retailing subsidiaries respond to shifting demand, raw-material price changes, acquisition integrations and competitive landscapes through cost containment, organizational flexibility, and development of sustainable competitive advantages, while our finance and financial products businesses balance growth in home sales, financing activities and leasing operations with the tolerance for risk and maintenance of credit strength to absorb pressures and preserve firm performance under evolving market conditions. Berkshire’s policy of decentralized management, diversified operations, robust cash holdings and risk-aware governance constitutes an overarching resilience strategy designed to absorb strain, preserve functioning and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

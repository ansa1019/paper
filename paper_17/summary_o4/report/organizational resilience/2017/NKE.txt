Nike’s annual report discloses a comprehensive risk management framework designed to preserve operational integrity under internal and external pressures, including forward-looking assessments of international, national and local economic and market conditions, the impact of extreme weather events, political and economic instability, terrorism, climate change and disease outbreaks, as well as the financial health of counterparties and customers. The company details its complex information systems and controls for demand and supply planning, inventory control and digital commerce, acknowledges interruptions in data and information technology systems and transportation delays as business continuity risks, and describes its futures ordering program, which minimizes inventory holdings, purchasing costs, order-fulfillment time and the risk of non-delivery. Nike emphasizes strategic initiatives such as the “consumer direct offense,” significant investment in digital commerce and new store openings, and the continued development of innovative, premium products supported by research and development and high-quality endorsement contracts as mechanisms to maintain competitive advantage, adapt to shifting consumer preferences and allocate resources efficiently. The report also highlights the use of hedging programs to defer the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on product cost and financial results, the maintenance of committed credit and commercial paper facilities to ensure liquidity, the rigorous governance of contractors through codes of conduct and environmental, health and safety standards, and the continuous pursuit of manufacturing efficiency, supply-chain automation and working capital optimization—all reflecting a systemic, multifaceted approach to absorbing strain, reconfiguring operations and sustaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

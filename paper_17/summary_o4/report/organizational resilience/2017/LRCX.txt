The company’s 2017 Form 10-K repeatedly underscores its focus on sustaining positive performance under challenging conditions by continuously reassessing and reallocating resources in response to rapid growth or decline in customer demand, maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, workforce training, and supply-chain infrastructure to preserve operational continuity, and warning that failure to do so may negatively affect margins and earnings. It emphasizes that success depends on senior management’s capacity to identify and respond effectively to external pressures, that cost-management programs and continued investment in research and development and global customer support—even during periods of reduced revenues—are necessary to remain competitive, and that strategic resource alignment is critical both to scaling infrastructure appropriately and avoiding excess fixed costs. The company also highlights its reliance on critical internal and outsourced information systems secured by ISO 27001-compliant procedures, intrusion prevention, access controls and emergency recovery processes to mitigate cybersecurity and other disruptions; acknowledges that any failure or breach could impair its operations and reputation; and notes that diversified manufacturing locations, ongoing product and process innovation, and prudent management of long-lived and intangible assets are essential to absorb strain, preserve system integrity and performance, and emerge stronger from adverse market or industry disturbances.

Booking Holdings’ 10-K discloses that the company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows are exposed to a wide array of internal and external disturbances—ranging from macro-economic downturns, political uncertainty (such as Brexit and sovereign debt crises), oil price swings, currency volatility and fluctuating travel transaction taxes, to pandemics, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, extreme weather events and cyber-security breaches—that are largely unpredictable and can dramatically and suddenly impair consumer demand, interrupt travel behavior and undermine its ability to facilitate travel and restaurant reservations. In response to this spectrum of disruptive events, the company has invested heavily in risk mitigation and business-continuity measures—including the maintenance of redundant systems and hosting services, data-center capacity planning, disaster recovery processes (albeit acknowledging that formalized regional recovery plans may not be complete), and cyber-defenses against phishing, denial-of-service and other attacks—while also allocating resources to diversified business models (agency and merchant), geographic expansion across multiple jurisdictions and evolving technology platforms (desktop, mobile apps and optimized websites) to absorb strain, preserve or improve performance and maintain system integrity under challenging conditions. Booking Holdings further adapts its operational flexibility and strategic response through targeted performance and brand advertising, flexible pricing and payment capabilities, inter-organizational distribution relationships and continuous system enhancements aimed at sustaining consumer confidence, reconstituting service delivery during disruptions and emerging stronger from adverse, exceptional or extreme circumstances.

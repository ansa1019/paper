Management emphasizes monitoring the dynamics of the global economy, healthcare industry and markets in which we compete, assessing opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and better aligning expenses with revenues while preserving our capacity to invest in research and development, capital and our people—an approach that enables positive adjustment under challenging conditions and supports business continuity.  In pursuit of enhanced resilience, we have undertaken distinct restructuring and optimization initiatives, approved by our board of directors, to realign our business portfolio and strengthen our growth potential, including strengthening global infrastructure, evolving real estate assets and workplaces, developing global commercial and technical competencies, enhancing manufacturing and distribution capabilities in key regions and continuing implementation of our plant network optimization strategy, which simplifies our manufacturing plant structure through the movement of business activities, facility consolidations, closures and product‐line transfers.  These measures, while requiring significant investment, management time and coordination across information technology, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance, are intended to expand operational efficiencies in support of our operating income margin goals and to reinvest a substantial portion of the savings into strategic growth initiatives, thereby enabling the organization to absorb strain, preserve and improve functioning and emerge stronger from disruptive events.  Complementing these internal adaptations, we pursue strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances to diversify into new markets and technologies, manage our debt levels through disciplined use of financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital, maintain investment‐grade credit ratings, access commercial paper and revolving credit facilities for liquidity management, and proactively identify and mitigate risks arising from competitive activity, industry consolidation, regulatory reforms, economic volatility and other external pressures—all of which reflect our systemic perspective and dynamic capability to allocate resources, reconfigure operations, assess and respond to risk, and sustain organizational health and performance under unpredictable conditions.

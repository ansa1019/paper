Home Depot’s disclosures describe a comprehensive set of capabilities and initiatives intended to preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions and external pressures, including extensive investments in information technology and supply chain infrastructure to enable operational flexibility, maintain interconnected retail and delivery options, and streamline order fulfillment; rigorous risk mitigation processes encompassing self-insurance programs for general liability, workers’ compensation and medical claims, back-up credit facilities and commercial paper programs for liquidity, and the use of derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency and interest-rate exposures; contingency planning and rapid response mechanisms for catastrophic events—such as the third-quarter 2017 hurricanes that generated approximately $662 million of incremental sales yet incurred $170 million of related expenses—designed to support business continuity; regular review and updating of systems, processes and procedures to protect data integrity and guard against cybersecurity threats, following the 2014 data breach; strategies to adapt to shifting competitive and consumer environments—including the continual evolution of multichannel delivery services, “one Home Depot” supply chain investments, and localized merchandising assortments—to sustain performance under dynamic market conditions; and a disciplined approach to strategic transactions, capital expenditures, leasing and vendor collaborations that reinforces organizational agility, resource deployment, crisis preparedness and the capacity to absorb strain while preserving financial and operational health.

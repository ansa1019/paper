Schwab’s disclosures describe a comprehensive risk management framework and operational infrastructure intended to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including detailed policies, procedures and systems to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate operational, compliance, credit, market and liquidity risks; a Global Risk Committee and functional risk sub‐committees establish risk appetite, tolerance levels and early warning indicators, while management conducts periodic risk and control self‐assessments, control testing and internal audit reviews to oversee the effectiveness of internal controls. The firm maintains geographically dispersed backup and recovery sites, routinely tests business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of critical business functions and technology systems to reduce the impact of system interruptions, errors or downtime from events such as natural disasters, cyber attacks, hardware or software failures and capacity constraints. Information security is governed by an integrated program of tools, controls, technologies and employee training designed to prevent unauthorized access, misuse or loss of data, and dedicated fraud and cybersecurity teams monitor and respond to emerging threats. Schwab manages third-party and fiduciary risks through contractual provisions, control standards and oversight committees, and controls model risk by registering and classifying all valuation and risk models in a centralized database with governance appropriate to each model’s risk rating. To ensure ongoing liquidity and capital strength, Schwab conducts regular stress testing—both liquidity coverage and net interest income simulations under rising and falling rate scenarios—and maintains committed and uncommitted credit facilities, diversified funding sources and a capital contingency plan to support operational flexibility, compliance with regulatory capital requirements and sustained client confidence under adverse conditions.

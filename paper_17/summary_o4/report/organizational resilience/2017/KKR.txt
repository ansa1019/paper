Kkr discloses that, while the firm attempts to mitigate known risks—for example through business continuity and disaster-recovery plans, investment accounting controls, compliance programs and selective use of risk-mitigation instruments—there can be no assurance these efforts will succeed in enabling the firm to preserve or enhance its capacity to absorb shocks such as severe market or economic downturns, data-security breaches or disruptions in third-party service providers. Kkr’s reliance on complex information systems, on a limited number of key personnel, and on internal knowledge, processes and controls to manage increasingly diverse funds, vehicles and global operations exposes the firm to operational failures and continuity risks that may degrade performance and impair its ability to reconfigure resources and respond quickly to unexpected situations. The firm also emphasizes its need to maintain robust processes and tools to support a collaborative culture and to manage change across business segments, to withstand environmental perturbations and regulatory pressures, and to achieve a systemic response in investing, capital allocation, crisis management and recovery. These disclosures implicitly stress Kkr’s organizational resilience as the preservation of positive adjustment—through resource allocation, adaptation strategies and information and financial instruments—under nominal, extreme or exceptional internal and external stresses.

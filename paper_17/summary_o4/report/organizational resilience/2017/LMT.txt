Lockheed Martin’s 2017 annual report describes a comprehensive framework of practices and structures designed to maintain performance under pressures and uncertainties, including systematic risk identification, management and mitigation processes that support business continuity—such as multi‐year contracting, performance-based or progress payment arrangements and advance agreements to allocate environmental and pension costs—and the ongoing recalibration of contract estimates and reserves to address technical, schedule and cost variances. The company emphasizes continual program execution improvements and cost-recovery mechanisms under U.S. government and international contracts, diversification of its government, commercial and international portfolio to reduce dependency on any single program, and the retention of liquidity through revolving credit facilities, commercial paper and cash reserves to absorb funding interruptions. Lockheed Martin also highlights its layered cybersecurity and physical security incident response plans, regular training to counter evolving threats, and reliance on performance metrics and oversight structures to detect and correct deviations in supplier and partner performance. Investments in facilities infrastructure, information technology and workforce development further strengthen operational flexibility, while the management of pension funding, insurance coverage and contingency financing supports the company’s ability to sustain organizational integrity, resource reconfiguration and program performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

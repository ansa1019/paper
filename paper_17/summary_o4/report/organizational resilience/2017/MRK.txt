Following a June 27, 2017 network cyber-attack that disrupted its worldwide operations—including manufacturing, research and sales—the company continued to fulfill orders by leveraging unaffected external manufacturing, recorded remediation expenses partly offset by insurance recoveries, borrowed and later replenished Gardasil 9 doses from the U.S. CDC pediatric vaccine stockpile, and has implemented an enterprise-wide effort to enhance resiliency against future attacks by hardening its systems, monitoring IT and personnel usage, and improving its speed of recovery and continuity of operations during remediation periods. Similarly, in September 2017, Hurricane Maria’s impact on Puerto Rico’s infrastructure did not substantially damage the company’s lone plant, which resumed production via alternative power and water sources, restored supply chains and realized only immaterial sales effects. To mitigate rapid post-exclusivity sales declines and intensified competition, the company commits substantial effort, funds and resources to research and development, external collaborations and continuous product launches sufficient to cover R&D costs, replace lost volumes and sustain performance under adverse conditions. Recognizing dependencies on third-party suppliers and service providers, evolving regulatory and legal requirements, global economic and currency fluctuations, pricing pressures, credit risk and product liability exposures, the company employs financial hedging, insurance programs, alternative sourcing, contractual risk allocation and contingency planning to preserve operational flexibility and maintain business continuity across its global enterprise.

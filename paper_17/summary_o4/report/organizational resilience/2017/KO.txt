The company’s MD&A describes a systematic approach to preserving or improving organizational functioning under adverse conditions by leveraging its internal knowledge, core capabilities, resource allocation and systemic perspective to achieve long-term sustainable growth.  It defines strategic resilience in terms of five priorities—accelerating growth of a consumer-centric brand portfolio, driving a revenue growth algorithm, strengthening the Coca-Cola system, digitizing the enterprise and unlocking the power of its people—and embeds these in a productivity and reinvestment program focused on global supply chain optimization, data and information-technology standardization, resource and cost reallocation, and operating expense leverage.  A formal water risk management program assesses local watershed hazards and implements water-use efficiency, wastewater treatment, shared watershed protection and community engagement to mitigate water-related risks, while a sustainable sourcing commitment addresses food-security pressures by protecting the environment, upholding workplace rights and promoting female-farmer economic opportunity.  Franchise leadership practices—shared values, aligned incentives, best-practice sharing and a supply-chain network that leverages system scale—support inter-organizational collaboration, agility and continuity across bottling partners.  The company’s integrated quality management program continuously measures product-safety and ingredient-quality risks across regulatory environments, identifies and mitigates hazards and drives improvement, thereby sustaining performance under pressure.  Risk-mitigation frameworks encompass obesity, evolving consumer preferences, competitive threats, water scarcity, agricultural commodity variability and political or currency volatility, with ongoing recoverability and impairment tests of assets and goodwill, scenario-based impairment analyses and dynamic capital and liquidity planning to ensure operational flexibility, strategic adaptation and system integrity in the face of disruptive change.

The Company’s 2017 Form 10-K describes a comprehensive set of policies, processes and investments designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances, including forward-looking risk assessment, maintenance of business continuity plans and monitoring of evolving cybersecurity threats through network and system surveillance, expert hiring, employee training and security policies. It details its ability to respond to disruptive events such as voluntary product recalls—discontinuing third-party suppliers, reconstituting production in-house, imposing temporary ship-holds and returning to full supply capacity—and to manage interruptions of manufacturing operations caused by natural disasters or equipment failures by leveraging alternate production sites, qualifiable suppliers and rapid reconfiguration of manufacturing and distribution. The report underscores efforts to mitigate the risks of implementing a new global ERP system through detailed design, implementation and governance measures, and to manage supply chain vulnerabilities by qualifying sole-source suppliers and maintaining inventory reserves. Financial resilience is addressed via a capital allocation strategy prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases, supplemented by operating cash flow, strategic use of debt, commercial paper programs and committed credit facilities to ensure liquidity and flexibility; it also discusses maintaining strong investment-grade credit ratings and managing foreign currency exposures. The Company records reserves for legal, regulatory and tax contingencies, performs annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and conducts periodic reviews of other long-lived assets to maintain system integrity, all reflecting an integrated, systemic perspective on risk mitigation, resource allocation and adaptive capacity to sustain performance under pressure, confront unexpected situations and emerge stronger from adversity.

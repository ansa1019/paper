The Company’s Annual Report discloses that its global operations and structure face a variety of external pressures that, if unmitigated, could undermine its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including social, political and economic risks in numerous jurisdictions, currency volatility and conversion restrictions that may impede the transfer of capital and cash flows, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tax and tariffs, conflicting law-compliance obligations, regional business-cycle instability, political unrest, civil disorder, terrorism, foreign ownership limits and capital-access constraints. In addition, disruptions in global capital and credit markets are noted as potential triggers for adverse effects on property valuations, the availability and terms of financing, debt service and refinancing capacity, and customers’ ability to enter new or satisfy existing leases, thereby threatening operational continuity and performance maintenance. Information-technology risks are addressed through system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan; however, the Company acknowledges vulnerability to energy blackouts, natural disasters, cyber-security attacks, telecommunications failures, terrorism and war, any of which could materially disrupt operations, incur remediation costs and expose it to legal, financial and reputational harm. The report further recognizes the dependency on key personnel with specialized industry knowledge as a critical organizational capability, whereby the loss or reassignment of executives could impair competitive positioning and adaptive strategies. The inherent illiquidity of real estate investments is identified as a constraint on the firm’s ability to reconstitute or reallocate resources promptly in response to market perturbations, often necessitating divestitures, financing arrangements or lease renegotiations under suboptimal terms. To mitigate physical and financial hazards, the Company routinely evaluates and maintains property insurance—including earthquake, hurricane, flood, fire, windstorm and terrorism coverage—subject to commercially reasonable limits, while electing self-insurance in certain jurisdictions based on external consultant analyses; it acknowledges that some perils cannot be economically insured and may result in significant capital loss and future revenue impairment. The Annual Report also details the strategic complexity of forming and managing co-investment ventures—involving divergent partner approval rights, capital contribution obligations, transfer restrictions, potential conflicts and dispute-resolution risks—that impact the Company’s capacity to sustain integrity and performance across its consolidated and unconsolidated platforms. Finally, climate-related exposures, including the prospect of more frequent extreme weather events and evolving energy-efficiency standards, are recognized as factors requiring ongoing risk assessment and resilience strategies to preserve system integrity, reconfigure development trajectories and emerge stronger from adverse events.

The Company’s Form 10-K describes an organizational model designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by allocating significant resources to diversify its pipeline—including substantial investments in next-generation CFTR correctors and strategic collaborations with third parties—and by continuously reassessing commercial and development priorities in light of evolving clinical data, competitor actions and regulatory feedback. It underscores the importance of operational flexibility and business continuity planning in managing a global supply chain that relies on third-party manufacturers, noting single-source supplier risks for key product components and the implementation of disaster recovery and continuity measures to safeguard critical research, manufacturing and information technology systems. The report details how the Company adapts to external pressures—such as changes in government reimbursement policies, economic and geopolitical uncertainties like Brexit, data privacy and health care fraud and abuse laws—through a robust compliance infrastructure, dynamic resource allocation and contingency funding arrangements, including a revolving credit facility and equity issuances. It further highlights continuous risk assessment and mitigation efforts—addressing market concentration in cystic fibrosis therapies, the potential for supply disruptions, regulatory and clinical trial uncertainties, product liability exposures and competitive challenges—in order to preserve organizational health, system integrity and performance maintenance under both expected and exceptional conditions.

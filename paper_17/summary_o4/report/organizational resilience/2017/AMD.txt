AMD’s risk disclosures emphasize continuity and adaptation across its supply chain, notably through the wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GlobalFoundries, which requires AMD to purchase all microprocessor and APU wafer requirements through 2024, with amendments providing limited waivers, annual purchase targets and frameworks for technology collaboration on 7 nm, reflecting collaborative networks and resource allocation to maintain functioning under potential capacity constraints. Reliance on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate silicon wafers and on third-party manufacturers for assembly, testing, marking and packing means that any damage to facilities, power outages or disruptions in manufacturing yields could cause supply delays, shortages or higher costs, compelling AMD to allocate products among customers and maintain contingency sourcing to preserve business continuity. The equity interest purchase agreement with TFME for ATMP joint ventures and the licensed-IP arrangement with the THATIC JV illustrate asset reconfiguration, inter-organizational collaboration and reconstituting of organizational structures to support expansion into new markets while safeguarding IP integrity and supporting project development. AMD’s secured revolving credit facility and strategic repurchases of higher-rate debt demonstrate financial resilience and proactive liquidity management to fund research and development under market volatility, while multiple restructuring initiatives and flexible lease arrangements reflect systematic organizational change processes that align resources with strategic priorities. Detailed disclosures on competitive pressures, geopolitical and economic uncertainty, foreign currency fluctuations, environmental regulations, cybersecurity vulnerabilities and natural disasters underscore broad risk assessment, crisis management mechanisms and compliance processes aimed at enabling positive adjustment under challenging conditions, sustaining system integrity and competitive advantage.

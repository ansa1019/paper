The report acknowledges that numerous factors could adversely affect the company’s operations, performance and financial condition, including the inability to continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services that meet customer requirements, failure “to anticipate customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends,” and the need to make “long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources” before knowing customer demand. It describes the complexity, cost and uncertainty of adapting products to new devices and operating systems and warns that “we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities.” The disclosure further notes that “if a transition among data centers or to third-party service providers encounters unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity, or unplanned disruptions despite precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our delivery of products and services,” and that “if we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base … service outages could occur and our customers could suffer impaired performance of our services.” It recognizes reliance on third-party hosting and includes the potential for “unauthorized access to or disclosure of data” and that “security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated” despite devoting “significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates … and improving our incident response time.” The firm also describes efforts to mitigate financial risks, stating that “we follow an established investment policy … to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk,” and that “we attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense.” Finally, the report highlights environmental and geopolitical threats by acknowledging that “catastrophic events may disrupt our business” and listing “major earthquake faults” near critical facilities and climate-related vulnerabilities, including “prolonged droughts due to climate change” affecting access to clean water and energy, with potential for “losses to our business, and added costs to resume operations.”

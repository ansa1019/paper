The Company’s disclosure of business and operating risks underscores its focus on preserving operational integrity and performance under challenging conditions, including its “dependence on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots,” and the potential for “unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems,” as well as its reliance on “primary and back-up systems” and the need to “make significant investments to fix or replace them” to mitigate system failures. The report further details risk mitigation measures such as “significant technology investments to improve or replace critical information systems and processing capabilities,” change management processes to reduce the “risk of system disruption” when undertaking “significant system changes,” and extensive information-security controls to guard against “internal or external security breaches” and “unauthorized access to our data systems.” In addressing financial continuity, the Company describes maintaining “bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes” and self-insurance programs covering “certain catastrophic risks” to absorb strain from property, casualty, health care, workers’ compensation and other liabilities. Supply-chain resilience is reflected in discussions of vendor relationships and the risks that “vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices” or that “one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal, regulatory, labor, environmental or animal welfare standards,” requiring adjustments in sourcing and inventory management. The Company’s strategic adaptation to external pressures is evidenced by its emphasis on “expanding our business in existing markets and new markets,” “adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items,” and the recognition that “general economic factors” such as “energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, foreign-currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence” can “adversely affect demand” and necessitate operational flexibility. Human capital resilience is supported by a compensation philosophy that favors “maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average” to “reduce turnover and enhance employee satisfaction,” while risk planning for public health disruptions, climate-related extreme weather, regulatory changes and geopolitical events underpins the Company’s commitment to “maintain its integrity and its performance” in both nominal and “extreme” conditions. Finally, liquidity management and capital resources are aligned with resilience objectives through a funding model based on “cash flows generated from warehouse operations,” targeted capital expenditure plans for new and remodeled warehouses and information systems, and a disciplined approach to debt issuance and repayment to ensure the organization can absorb strain and preserve or improve its functioning despite adversity.

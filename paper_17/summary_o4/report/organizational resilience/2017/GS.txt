Goldman Sachs’ annual report discloses a comprehensive resilience‐oriented framework in which governance committees, independent control and support functions, and scenario‐based policies ensure the firm’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity. Liquidity risk management maintains a pre‐funded pool of global core liquid assets and a contingency funding plan with defined escalation protocols, while balance‐sheet planning, limits and scenario analyses—including modeled and intraday liquidity outflows—support operational continuity in extreme conditions. Capital planning and stress testing procedures, including CCAR, DFAST, recovery and resolution planning (RCAP and RLAP) and triggers‐and‐alerts frameworks, reconfigure capital and liquidity trajectories toward the future and align with the preferred single‐point‐of‐entry strategy. An enterprise risk management structure led by the firmwide risk, enterprise risk, reputational risk, suitability and global business resilience committees drives a systemic perspective on market, credit, operational and model risks, applying VAR, sensitivity and historical and hypothetical stress tests to measure exposures, establish risk appetite thresholds and guide mitigation. Credit risk management employs independent counterparty reviews, exposure limits, collateral and netting agreements to mitigate default risk, while operational risk management uses self‐assessments, loss‐event data, internal controls and business continuity and technology‐resilience programs to reduce process, system and fraud failures. Model risk management institutes rigorous development, validation and usage standards to ensure that the firm’s pricing models and risk measures remain robust under evolving market disturbances. Together these practices embody the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, ensuring adaptability, performance maintenance and business continuity when confronted with unexpected disruptions.

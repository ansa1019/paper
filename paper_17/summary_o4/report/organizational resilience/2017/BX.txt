Our business is materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic events outside our control, including changes in interest rates, credit availability, inflation, economic uncertainty, trade barriers, currency exchange controls and national and international political circumstances, and we may not be able to manage our exposure to these market conditions or other events, which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow. In the event of a market downturn each of our businesses could be affected in different ways, and turmoil in the global financial markets can provoke significant volatility of securities prices and have a material and rapid impact on our valuations, which may hinder our ability to realize investments in a timely manner and limit our flexibility to deploy capital. During periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns, our portfolio companies may suffer adverse operating performance, difficulty in obtaining financing and increased funding costs, and negative market conditions may require us to cut back or eliminate the use of certain services or service providers or terminate the employment of personnel that are important to our business, without which our operating results could be adversely affected. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems and on our disaster recovery and business continuity programs, but any failure or disruption of these systems, whether due to cyberattack, natural disaster or otherwise, could impair our ability to operate without interruption and expose us to financial loss, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. We use cash to facilitate the growth of our businesses, pay operating expenses, service interest payments, make distributions and fund capital commitments to our investment funds, and if economic or market conditions worsen we might experience reduced carried interest, difficulty raising capital, limited liquidity under our revolving credit facility, and potentially be compelled to rely on alternative funding sources on terms that may not be acceptable or available, any of which could adversely affect our liquidity position, operational continuity and ability to respond effectively to future challenges.

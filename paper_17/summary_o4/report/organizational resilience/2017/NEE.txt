Nee’s and FPL’s 10-K disclosures describe a comprehensive framework of risk mitigation and continuity mechanisms designed to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances. Regulatory and legislative uncertainties are addressed through reconfiguring cost recovery clauses, reserve amortization and rate-base investments, while extensive federal, state and local regulations drive compliance programs intended to maintain integrity and performance. Operational continuity is supported by emergency management protocols, storm funds, securitized storm-recovery cost mechanisms and rapid restoration procedures—evidenced by FPL’s restoration of power to 50% of affected customers within one day and 95% within seven days following Hurricane Irma—alongside contractual protections, insurance, surety bonds and collateral arrangements to manage liability and resource constraints. The Company employs derivative instruments, hedging and trading procedures, value-at-risk modeling, stop-loss limits and liquidity guidelines to manage commodity price volatility, counterparty credit risk and market liquidity reductions, recognizing that such tools, while integral to systemic resilience, may not fully protect against significant losses. Cybersecurity and information-technology governance guard against unauthorized access and system failures, and structured investments in special use funds for nuclear decommissioning and deferral of asset retirement costs aim to ensure adequate resource deployment for future obligations. In addition, project development, construction and acquisition activities incorporate contingency planning for licensing, permitting, cost overruns, contract performance and labor disputes to safeguard capital expenditures, while credit facilities, capital covenant compliance and access to capital markets underpin financial flexibility amid turbulent market conditions. Through these regulatory, operational, financial and strategic initiatives, Nee and FPL seek to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, adapt to disruptive change and uphold organizational resilience.

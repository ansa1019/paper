Mastercard’s annual report describes a comprehensive framework of policies, procedures and resources aimed at sustaining performance under internal or external disturbances, reflecting a systemic perspective on risk mitigation, operational flexibility and business continuity.  The company maintains an information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage, each reviewed by its board of directors and audit committee, and its processing systems incorporate multiple levels of protection, with ongoing testing to discover and address potential vulnerabilities.  It guarantees settlement of transactions between issuers and acquirers and mitigates settlement risk through monitoring customers’ financial condition, their economic and political operating environments and their compliance with participation standards, thereby absorbing strain and preserving functioning despite the presence of adversity.  Mastercard also manages foreign currency balance‐sheet remeasurement and cash‐flow risk through dedicated foreign‐exchange risk‐management activities, maintains access to a committed credit facility to preserve liquidity in extreme conditions and conducts risk assessments of its global data network, which spans more than 210 countries, to respond effectively to technology malfunctions, natural disasters, cybersecurity threats, power outages, terrorism or other catastrophic events.  In addition, it continually reviews the resiliency of its third‐party service providers, relies on multi‐rail network design and system redundancy to ensure operational continuity and adapts its strategic initiatives—such as the expansion into real‐time account‐based payments—to transform emerging challenges into competitive advantage, supporting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

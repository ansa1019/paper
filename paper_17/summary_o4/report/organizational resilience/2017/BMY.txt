The Company acknowledges that loss of critical molecular assets or its compound library through natural or man-made disasters or acts of sabotage could impair the product development cycle and that the failure of critical third parties, including their inability to deploy business continuity plans in a crisis, could materially disrupt operations and supply; it also recognizes that supply chain interruptions from natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, as evidenced by reduced capacity at its Puerto Rico manufacturing sites following hurricanes and the ongoing effort to restore normal operations, could adversely affect product availability and sales. The risk of significant cyber-attacks, system breakdowns, data leakage or reputational harm from industrial espionage, malware or other breaches, despite investments in protective measures, monitoring and cyber insurance, further underscores the importance of robust information security and operational continuity. The Company notes that delays or failures in development or commercialization of new compounds, regulatory approval setbacks, manufacturing shutdowns for non-compliance with CGMP, counterfeiting, resource constraints, or the inability to integrate acquired assets and align organizational processes, controls and personnel could negatively impact resource deployment, strategic initiatives and financial performance. In response, the Company is evolving its operating model by streamlining functions, realigning manufacturing capabilities to reflect a biologics-focused portfolio, concentrating commercial and R&D resources on prioritized brands and markets, advancing its pipeline through internal efforts and strategic collaborations, maintaining liquidity through diversified credit facilities, and implementing risk management frameworks to preserve operational flexibility and support ongoing resilience under adverse conditions.

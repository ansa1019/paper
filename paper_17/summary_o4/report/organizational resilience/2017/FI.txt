In the risk factors section, the company notes that security breaches, computer malware or other “cyber attacks” could harm its business by disrupting the delivery of services, damaging client relationships and requiring it to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance its information security and controls; it further acknowledges that operational failures—whether caused by its actions or by third parties, involving networks and systems over which it has limited or no control—could cause service interruptions, data loss and reputational harm, underscoring the importance of risk mitigation, operational continuity and resource allocation under challenging conditions; management warns that if it fails to adapt its products and services to changes in technology or the marketplace, including ongoing efforts to upgrade its technology, it could lose clients or have trouble attracting new ones, demonstrating a focus on adaptability, innovation and systemic response to external perturbations; the company’s description of strategic initiatives such as active portfolio management of its businesses, enhancing client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in its allocation of capital, and differentiating its products and services through innovation reflects organizational resilience strategies aimed at absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning; and the reliance on recurring account- and transaction-based fees under long-term contracts is presented as a scalable model to maintain performance, reduce variability and sustain competitive advantage amid market consolidation, regulatory scrutiny and disruptive change.

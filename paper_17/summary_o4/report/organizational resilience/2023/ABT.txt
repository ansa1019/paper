In its 10-K, Abbott acknowledges that disruptions to its large and complex global supply chain could negatively affect operations and has “taken and will continue to take actions to mitigate the risks of disruptions to its global supply chain,” including prioritizing production at multiple facilities, converting manufacturing lines, and importing product from FDA-registered sites to ensure operational continuity. The company invests in its information systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of a cybersecurity incident or other significant disruption, and monitors its information systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate foreign currency exposure and regularly analyzes historical rebate trends to adjust reserves, illustrating systematic risk assessment and resource allocation. During its voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage, the firm “managed the various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials and supplies,” deploying alternative sourcing strategies and resource reconfiguration. Abbott pursues acquisitions, licensing arrangements and strategic alliances, integrates acquired technologies, and has approved restructuring plans to streamline operations and improve efficiencies, reflecting dynamic capabilities and adaptive resource deployment. Management monitors the creditworthiness of customers, establishes allowances for expected credit losses, and maintains available cash and credit lines to preserve financial flexibility. Substantial investments in research and development and capital expenditures across diagnostics, medical devices, nutritionals and pharmaceuticals support performance maintenance and system integrity under internal or external variations. Abbott’s debt management, dividend policy and investment grade credit ratings, together with operating cash flow that continues to exceed capital expenditures and cash dividends, underscore its capacity to reconstitute resource trajectories toward sustainable growth and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

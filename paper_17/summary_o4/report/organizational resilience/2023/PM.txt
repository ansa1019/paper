The annual report discloses multiple practices and capabilities that support organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company continuously assesses evolving geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine, suspending planned investments, scaling down manufacturing in affected regions, and investing $30 million to establish a new facility in western Ukraine to reconstitute production and preserve business continuity. It maintains business continuity plans and other safeguards—while acknowledging they “might not always be effective to fully mitigate” extreme events—and develops contingency plans to address supply chain disruptions, credit market volatility, regulatory constraints and operational interruptions. Reliance on third-party distributors, manufacturers and service providers is coupled with provisions to replace or augment partners and with ongoing monitoring of credit and counterparty risk to preserve operational flexibility and resource deployment. The company continuously monitors and tests long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment, applies risk assessment protocols to evaluate environmental, tax and regulatory developments, and adapts strategic priorities—including resource reallocation, product innovation and market diversification—to sustain performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional pressures. In response to pandemic- and conflict-induced disruptions, it has modified production footprints, pursued contract manufacturing arrangements, reassessed capital allocations, and built scientific assessment capabilities to absorb strain and transform toward its strategic objectives for reduced-risk and smoke-free product portfolios. Cybersecurity and data governance programs, environmental risk mitigation measures and dynamic credit access strategies further exemplify its systemic perspective on preserving integrity, responsiveness and continuity in the face of internal and external disturbances.

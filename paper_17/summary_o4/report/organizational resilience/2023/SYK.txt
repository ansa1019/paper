The Company’s disclosures reflect a comprehensive acknowledgment of the need to sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions through a variety of operational, financial and organizational measures.  In its risk factors, the Company describes reliance on multiple and sole‐source suppliers and the allocation of significant capital expenditures to mitigate supply chain disruptions, manage inflationary pressures, and preserve production continuity, while noting the potential need to identify alternative suppliers under regulatory constraints.  It highlights forward‐looking projections regarding pricing pressures, geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, and changes in reimbursement and regulatory environments, all of which necessitate adaptive pricing strategies, volume management and foreign‐currency hedging to maintain performance.  Cybersecurity threats and information‐technology system failures are addressed via incident response protocols, investments in network monitoring, artificial‐intelligence‐driven defenses, employee training and business‐continuity planning to safeguard data integrity and operational resilience.  The implementation of a new global ERP system and the integration of acquired businesses are described as strategic initiatives requiring careful change management, workforce reductions or retention incentives and contingent‐consideration adjustments to realize anticipated synergies and maintain functional coherence.  Workforce development, including talent recruitment, succession planning and compensation alignment, is identified as critical to sustaining organizational capabilities and executing strategic objectives.  The Company further discusses contingency planning for manufacturing interruptions due to natural disasters, regulatory changes or hazards, supported by insurance programs and potential facility transfers to reconstitute capacity.  It also acknowledges demand volatility arising from public health emergencies, shifts in elective procedure volumes and macroeconomic oscillations, underscoring the importance of flexible resource deployment and rapid reconfiguration of production and distribution networks.  In management’s discussion and analysis, the Company’s liquidity and capital‐allocation strategy—comprising operating cash flows, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases, credit facilities and debt issuances—is presented as a means to preserve financial strength and ensure access to resources under varying market conditions.  Finally, evolving corporate responsibility, environmental, social and governance requirements, together with the physical and regulatory impacts of climate change, are recognized as external pressures that demand proactive adaptation of supply chain practices, facility resilience and strategic foresight to protect long‐term organizational health and performance.

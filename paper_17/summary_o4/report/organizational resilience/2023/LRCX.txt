The Company’s disclosures highlight its efforts to maintain organizational resilience by continuously reassessing strategic resource allocation in response to variability in customer demand and economic conditions, adjusting spending and operational resources to scale capacity appropriately and avoiding excess fixed costs. It acknowledges the challenges of maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating and managing its workforce, as well as appropriately sizing its supply chain infrastructure, facilities and other business components on a timely basis, and recognizes that failure to meet these challenges could negatively impact margins and earnings. Management deploys cost management programs aligned with anticipated revenue streams and sustains investment in research and development along with extensive worldwide customer service and support capabilities even during periods of reduced revenues. To mitigate supply chain and operational disruptions, the Company endeavors to establish alternative sources for critical components, implements business continuity and contingency plans to address events such as strikes, natural disasters, geopolitical disputes and pandemics, and maintains liquidity reserves, currency and interest rate hedges, and access to capital markets and credit facilities to ensure operational continuity and fund strategic initiatives. The 2023 restructuring plan and broader transformation initiatives, while intended to strengthen operations and achieve efficiencies, involve change management risks including potential loss of continuity, knowledge and transient inefficiencies. Moreover, the Company’s risk management framework addresses cybersecurity threats, concentration risks, export control and regulatory uncertainties, thereby preserving flexibility, integrity and performance under challenging and exceptional conditions.

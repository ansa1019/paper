Service interruptions or failures of our or third-party information technology systems may impair the availability of our products, services and solutions, expose us to liability, damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; we do not have redundancy for all our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities; any failure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers could disrupt our business operations, require costly and time-intensive notifications and cause us to lose customers; occasionally, we migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments, and if a transition encounters unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions despite precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our delivery of products, services and solutions and result in increased costs and liabilities; hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with applicable notification requirements or other relevant contractual obligations to our customers; if we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer and user base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers or those of third parties, service outages or performance issues could occur, which may subject us to regulatory and customer notification requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments or financial liabilities and result in customer dissatisfaction or harm our business; security incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our customers’ data or other cyber incidents may harm our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business despite our devotion of significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities, regularly reviewing our service providers’ security controls, reviewing and auditing our products, services and solutions against information security control frameworks, providing resources such as security training to our workforce and continually assessing and improving, as appropriate, our incident response process; we rely on third-party service providers and technologies to deliver our products, services and business operations and to operate critical business systems, and if such third parties are negatively affected, if we fail to effectively develop, manage and maintain relationships with them, or if we are unable to renew our agreements on favorable terms or at all, our expenses could significantly increase and we and our customers may experience service interruptions, which may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions or contracts and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers; a disruption, infiltration or failure of our systems, data centers or operations, or those of our third-party service providers, due to a major earthquake, other natural disasters (including climate-related events such as drought, heat waves, wildfires and poor air quality), power shutoff or loss, telecommunications failure, epidemic, pandemic, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event, could cause interruptions to our systems and business operations, damage to critical infrastructure, data security breaches and data loss and negatively impact demand for our products, services and solutions; climate-related catastrophic events that may harm our business are increasing in frequency and severity and the occurrence of an epidemic or a pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results and may intensify the other risks described in this report; to maintain financial flexibility and support our strategic initiatives we have a $1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, a $3 billion commercial paper program and authority to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock, which we may utilize to return value to stockholders, minimize dilution from stock issuances and preserve capital resources for investments, acquisitions and other corporate purposes.

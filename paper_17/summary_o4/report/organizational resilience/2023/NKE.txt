Nikeâ€™s disclosures describe a comprehensive approach to sustaining operations and performance under adverse or unexpected conditions, including the identification and mitigation of risks arising from interruptions in data and information-technology systems and disruptions in the global supply chain, the use of disaster recovery and business continuity planning across geographically diverse locations, and contingency measures for pandemics, extreme weather events and other natural disasters. The Company highlights its investments in information-technology infrastructure, enterprise resource planning, data and analytics, and demand-sensing capabilities to enhance operational flexibility and rapid response to environmental perturbations. It maintains credit and capital facilities to ensure financial resources for working capital needs, describes the use of forward-looking supply agreements and futures ordering programs to manage production and inventory in volatile markets, and employs foreign-currency hedging strategies to preserve margins amid exchange-rate fluctuations. Nike also emphasizes its crisis-management protocols, including preventative health measures, emergency management for factory and logistics partners, and reputational defenses through compliance and ethical sourcing programs, all of which serve to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity. Its strategic focus on product innovation, digital transformation of retail and direct-to-consumer channels, and ongoing investments in technology and human capital reflect a future-orientation and dynamic capabilities designed to allow the organization to adapt, reconfigure resources and maintain performance under diverse and challenging conditions.

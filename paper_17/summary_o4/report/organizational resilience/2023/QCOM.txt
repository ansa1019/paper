The company acknowledges a range of operational vulnerabilities and corresponding mitigation efforts that underpin its organizational resilience, including exposure to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact results of operations and require significant management time and attention, failures or inability to procure or allocate adequate raw materials or manufacturing capacity due to government prohibitions, capacity constraints or national security protection policies, and reliance on a limited number of third-party suppliers capable of leading process technology nodes. To preserve production continuity and reasonable margins, the company establishes multi-year capacity commitments, evaluates and may accelerate the qualification of alternate suppliers—which “may require significant amounts of time and levels of support” and incur higher costs—and retains long-term purchase commitments while monitoring supplier performance, quality, yield and delivery schedules. The company further identifies physical and systemic risks from natural disasters, effects of climate change, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of war, terrorism, geopolitical conflicts, or cyber-attacks on its own or its suppliers’ information technology systems, any of which “could disrupt our operations, cease or delay production and shipments of inventory and result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs and lost business.” In response, it maintains a robust cybersecurity program aligned to international frameworks to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, invests in environmental, health and safety compliance efforts—including new or additional investments in production processes to address greenhouse gas emissions—and has initiated restructuring actions to enable targeted investments in key growth and diversification opportunities across new and expanded product areas such as automotive and IoT. The company also manages its financial resilience through careful liquidity planning—comprising cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, operating cash flows, unsecured fixed-rate notes, a revolving credit facility and a capital return program—and regularly assesses the inherent uncertainties in forecasting customer demand, elevated customer inventory levels, cyclical downturns, macroeconomic weakness and competitive pressures from vertical integration, all of which could reduce revenues and available cash for critical purposes such as research and development.

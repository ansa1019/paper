The Company’s ability to maintain operational continuity under challenging conditions relies on a systemic approach to risk mitigation and resource reconfiguration, manifested through ongoing investments in building, maintaining, and scaling highly reliable and redundant technical infrastructure and data centers; the rapid recovery of user data and services following pandemics, natural disasters, power loss, cyber-attacks, terrorism, or other catastrophic events; and the reallocation of personnel, capital expenditures, and compliance resources to address evolving legislative, regulatory, and platform changes—including digital privacy frameworks, mobile operating system restrictions, and consent requirements—that impose external pressures and require product adaptation and strategic realignment. Management regularly adapts product and monetization strategies, such as adjusting ad delivery frequency, adopting new consent models for behavioral advertising, and emphasizing long-term user experience over immediate financial returns, to preserve business resilience and competitive advantage in turbulent markets. By balancing short-term disruptions against strategic foresight—exemplified by disciplined resource deployment toward privacy, safety, security, compliance processes, and emerging metaverse initiatives—the Company strives to enhance its resilience, sustainability, and capacity for positive adjustment under adverse and unpredictable operational and regulatory demands.

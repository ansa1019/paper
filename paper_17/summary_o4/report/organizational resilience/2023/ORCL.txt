The Company operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks driven by factors it cannot control or predict, and it continuously refreshes and releases new offerings of its cloud products and services while investing in expanded data center capacity, long-term operating leases and machine learning and AI innovations to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. It acknowledges that coding, manufacturing or configuration errors may arise despite testing prior to release and throughout the lifecycle, and it maintains processes to detect, correct and support its cloud, license and hardware offerings in order to mitigate service interruptions, security vulnerabilities and reputational harm. The Company depends on single-source suppliers for critical components and responds to supply chain shortages and constraints by committing to higher purchase volumes despite increased excess and obsolescence risk, and it outsources manufacturing with contingency planning for production delays. Periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations are executed to improve cost structure and redeploy resources, even as the Company adjusts hiring and compensation practices, on-site and hybrid work models, and employee retention measures to sustain productivity and organizational health. Its compliance framework includes contracts, diligence programs, policies and procedures to address data privacy, cybersecurity, export controls, sanctions, intellectual property and other regulatory risks, supported by internal investigations, reporting mechanisms and remediation strategies. Through a selective and active acquisition program, the Company integrates acquired companies, products, services and technologies by measuring fair values of assets and liabilities, assessing pre-acquisition contingencies during the measurement period, and coordinating post-acquisition integration activities to enhance resilience and competitive position. It further monitors and assesses external pressures including pandemics, natural disasters, macroeconomic volatility, currency fluctuations, litigation outcomes, tax uncertainties and evolving environmental and governance regulations, applying risk assessment, contingency reserves, financial resource deployment and strategic planning to maintain operational continuity, system integrity and performance under pressure.

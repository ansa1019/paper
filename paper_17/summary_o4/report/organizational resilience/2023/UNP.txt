Management’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to preserving performance under challenging conditions through investments in capacity, technology, and human resources that enable the Company to absorb strain and maintain service continuity amid fluctuating demand, severe weather, cyber‐attacks, regulatory changes, and other internal or external perturbations. The report highlights efforts to improve the transportation plan, add network capacity, enhance yard and terminal operations, and maintain a resource buffer to address demand surges, complemented by the deployment of additional locomotives and the strategic hiring of train, engine, and yard employees to backfill attrition and cover absences. Safety and operational excellence programs incorporate risk assessment and hazard identification via training on critical operating rules, the use of proprietary software for proactive derailment prevention and simulation of in-train forces, installation of hot bearing detectors, real-time railcar condition monitoring, and data-driven predictive technology. Service improvement metrics—such as increased freight car velocity, higher car trip plan compliance, and greater network fluidity—reflect adaptability, resource reconfiguration, and reconstituted operational trajectories in response to disruptive events. Liquidity plans based on multiple economic scenarios, continued access to revolving credit and receivables facilities, and a capital plan focused on infrastructure hardening, system modernization, and growth projects demonstrate future orientation, strategic agility, and preparedness for adversity. Climate scenario analyses, renewable fuel initiatives, locomotive modernization for improved fuel efficiency, and exploration of low‐ and zero‐emission propulsion technologies further evidence a systemic perspective and resilience engineering to maintain integrity and performance while responding to evolving environmental pressures.

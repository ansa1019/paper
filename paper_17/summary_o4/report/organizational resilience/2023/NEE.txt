NEE and FPL employ a multifaceted set of resilience mechanisms, including the use of derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity; the establishment of nuclear decommissioning and storm restoration funds invested in fixed-income and equity securities to ensure the availability of financial resources for future obligations; the application of regulatory accounting, including deferral and amortization of storm and asset-removal costs and adjustments to reserve amortization to achieve targeted regulatory returns on equity; ongoing monitoring of current and forward credit exposure to counterparties both on an individual and aggregate basis; maintenance of syndicated and bilateral revolving credit facilities to secure liquidity for capital requirements, debt maturities and storm-recovery funding; and operational measures designed to address severe weather and other disruptive eventsâ€”such as additional winterizing of critical equipment, modifying plant operations, expanding load-shedding options, restoring service, repairing damaged facilities and obtaining replacement power, financing and insurance. These strategies, together with risk assessment and mitigation processes, guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds and investments in information technology security to guard against operator error, system failures, cyber incidents and other internal or external disruptions, support the preservation of system integrity and operating performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

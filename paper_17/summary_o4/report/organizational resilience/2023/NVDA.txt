The company discloses that “business disruptions could harm our operations and financial results,” and acknowledges that its “business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities,” highlighting the risk that “natural disasters and extreme weather conditions,” “heat waves, earthquakes, fires, or other natural disasters,” and “electricity conservation efforts” could disrupt manufacturing, assembly and other processes. It states that “catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services,” and that “our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics,” emphasizing “the vulnerabilities of our corporate headquarters in California” and of “other critical business operations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers … in Asia.” The report describes active “monitoring of the impact of geopolitical conflict” and “global supply chain constraints,” noting that “we have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements,” and that “these increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk,” thus revealing efforts to “absorb strain” and “preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.” It further discusses “long manufacturing lead times” and the fact that “extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events,” together with the use of “long-term supply and capacity commitments,” “premiums and deposits to secure future supply,” and the establishment of “inventory and excess inventory purchase commitments,” all of which reflect strategic resource allocation and risk mitigation measures. In addition, the company details “investments in training programs and security awareness initiatives,” acknowledges that “product, system security and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations” and that “we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised,” underlining “our efforts to continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features,” which demonstrates adaptive cybersecurity capabilities. The company also identifies that “climate change may have a long-term impact on our business,” that “water and energy availability and reliability … is critical,” and that “regulations that limit energy or water availability could impair the ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity,” indicating environmental risk assessment and adaptation strategies. Finally, the company maintains that its “liquidity … is sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months,” and that it “believes … we have sufficient liquidity to finance future capital requirements,” reflecting a systemic perspective on financial resilience and the “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

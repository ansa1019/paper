Mastercard’s 2023 Form 10-K discloses that central banks and regulatory bodies have “increasingly established or further expanded their authority over certain aspects of payments systems,” imposing “obligations or restrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer, the countries in which our products and services may be used, the way we structure and operate our business and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products or services,” a dynamic that has “resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise increase our costs.” The company warns that “failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.” Mastercard also highlights that it is “subject to increasingly complex, fragmented and divergent laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection, data use and governance, AI and information security,” which may “require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses, and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business,” and that it is “required to constantly monitor our data practices and potentially change them when necessary or appropriate.” On information security, the company acknowledges that its operations “rely on the secure transmission, storage and other processing of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal information in our computer systems and networks,” making it “likely to continue to be a target of cyber-threats and attacks” that could “lead to the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal information or data security compromises,” cause “service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure, networks or operations systems that support our business,” and lead to reputational damage, additional costs to “repair systems, add new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs,” regulatory penalties or financial losses. To address these risks, Mastercard “maintains an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies” and offers “cyber and intelligence solutions designed to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and cyber-attacks,” while recognizing that “there can be no assurance that such security solutions will perform as expected or address all possible security threats.” The report further cautions that “service disruptions that cause us to be unable to process transactions or service our customers could reduce our operational resilience and materially affect our overall business and results of operations” because transaction-switching systems “may continue to experience interruptions as a result of technology malfunctions, supply-chain attacks, fire, floods, earthquakes, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events,” and that “any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of products carrying our brands.” In addition, as Mastercard “continually involved in developing and implementing complex multi-rail solutions and diversifying our products and services,” it confronts “operational and onboarding challenges” in working with “different types of customers,” with “cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems” that “could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as negatively impact our brand and reputation.” Finally, the company warns that “rapid and significant technological developments and changes,” as well as the inability “to develop and adopt new services and technologies” or “keep pace technologically,” could “render obsolete the technologies we currently use” or inhibit its “ability to develop and adopt new services,” thereby jeopardizing operational continuity and undermining its capacity to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

In its Risk Factors, the company cautions that “disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities” due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events may result in delays in the production and delivery of merchandise to its warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction, and that natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, energy shortages or acts of terrorism could cause physical damage to properties, disruptions to its IT systems, temporary closures of warehouses, depots or other facilities, and interruptions in supply from local or overseas suppliers, any of which could require suspension of operations and materially adversely affect business continuity. It notes that availability and performance of its IT systems are vital to its business and that, given the high volume of transactions processed, “it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees, and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes,” warning that “any debilitating failure of our critical IT systems, data centers and backup systems would require significant investments in resources to restore IT services and may cause serious impairment in our business operations.” The company states “we are currently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency and failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business.” It also discloses that pandemics and other health crises, including COVID-19, could affect business operations, supply chain operations, availability of labor and demand, underscoring the need for adaptive response strategies, and that “we have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels,” although the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired rates of return. Moreover, the company emphasizes its dependence on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process and third-party logistics providers, and warns that failure to successfully execute IT transformation projects, maintain cybersecurity controls or respond to consumer trends could impair its day-to-day operations, damage its reputation and require additional resources for recovery. Collectively, these disclosures illustrate the organization’s efforts to absorb strain, allocate resources for risk mitigation, and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity, aligning with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

AbbVie recognizes that public health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had and could in the future have an adverse impact on its operations and financial condition, noting that the COVID-19 pandemic caused AbbVie to modify certain of its business practices and may require further actions to protect employees, patients, customers and business partners.  The Company relies on a complex supply chain for raw materials and components, including single-source suppliers, and acknowledges that interruptions—whether due to equipment malfunctions, protocol deviations, regulatory actions, environmental factors, natural disasters or supplier failures—could result in product shortages, increased costs, lost revenue and damage to customer relations, with business interruption insurance potentially proving inadequate.  AbbVie depends extensively on third-party service providers for research, development, manufacturing, commercialization, promotion and distribution of its products and notes that failures by critical partners to meet contractual, regulatory or quality obligations could materially and adversely affect its operations.  To remain competitive and preserve performance under pressure, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to ongoing research and development, product launches, pipeline expansion and strategic acquisitions, while acknowledging that development failures, regulatory delays, shifting clinical practices, competitor innovation, pricing pressures and reimbursement uncertainties could impair its resilience and its ability to maintain integrity and functioning under adversity.  The Company must incur significant expense and devote time and effort to ensure compliance with extensive international, federal and state regulations—ranging from manufacturing practices, labeling and advertising to government-set pricing under the Inflation Reduction Act—and warns that regulatory actions such as product recalls, seizures or production shutdowns could disrupt business continuity.  In managing intellectual property and litigation risks, AbbVie vigorously defends its patents, self-insures product liability exposures and establishes reserves for contingent liabilities, recognizing that unpredictable legal outcomes may require resource reallocation and contingency planning.  The Company also monitors its debt obligations, liquidity, credit facilities and credit ratings to preserve financial flexibility, aware that debt service requirements and changing market conditions could constrain capital deployment and necessitate adaptive financing strategies to sustain operations and strategic initiatives.

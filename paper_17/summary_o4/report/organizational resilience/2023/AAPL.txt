The company’s disclosures acknowledge that its business and global supply chain may be disrupted by political events, trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health crises, industrial accidents and other interruptions, and that many operations and supplier facilities located in regions prone to earthquakes, floods, fires, power shortages, cyberattacks and other hazards are exposed to interruptions beyond its control; following any such interruption, the company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to resume operations and experience lost sales, and changes to or additions in its supply chain entail considerable time, resources and uncertainties that may impede operational continuity. Although the company maintains insurance for certain losses and has invested in manufacturing process equipment, prepayments under long-term agreements, system upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures, it recognizes that such insurance coverage, disaster recovery planning and risk mitigation arrangements may be insufficient for all eventualities. The company’s reliance on complex information technology systems and vendor-provided services exposes it to failures or network disruptions caused by a wide array of events, and while it has devoted significant resources to network and data security—including encryption, authentication technologies, multifactor authentication, monitoring for unusual activity and account controls—these measures cannot guarantee absolute security or fully prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data. In addition, it has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with evolving laws and regulations worldwide and uses derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards and options to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations, but acknowledges these tools may not completely offset adverse financial effects or preclude violations by employees, contractors or agents, thereby necessitating ongoing investments in risk assessment, resilience strategies and organizational flexibility to preserve operations and performance under challenging conditions.

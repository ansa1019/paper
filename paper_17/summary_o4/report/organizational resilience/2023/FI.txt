The Company’s ability to respond to rapid technological change by enhancing existing products and developing new offerings reflects operational flexibility and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and its investment of significant resources to maintain and enhance information security and controls, and to investigate and mitigate security vulnerabilities, supports continuity and preservation of system integrity and performance despite evolving cyber threats. The Company’s business continuity program, including frequent testing of enhanced business continuity and disaster recovery plans mandated by clients and regulators, is designed to enable rapid recovery of critical business functions, assets and data in the event of operational failures such as hardware defects, cyber-attacks, natural disasters or other disruptions. Efforts to work with participants in the interconnected global financial system to avoid disruptions, and reliance on multiple external service providers and supply-chain partners with contingency planning for workforce shortages, component delays and cost increases, exemplify measures to absorb strain from external disturbances and preserve functioning. Active monitoring and management of unpredictable geopolitical, macroeconomic and foreign-exchange conditions, and the use of operating cash flow, undrawn credit facilities and diverse funding sources to ensure liquidity for operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service, demonstrate resource allocation and strategic resilience to maintain organizational health under turbulence. The evaluation and compliance with debt covenants and maintenance of investment-grade credit ratings underpin financial resilience by ensuring access to capital markets and flexibility to refinance maturing debt. These operational and financial strategies collectively support the organization’s capacity “to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change,” preserve performance under pressure and emerge stronger from exceptional conditions.

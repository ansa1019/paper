Schwab’s risk management governance and processes encompass operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risk, employing systematic risk identification and assessment, risk response, measurement and monitoring, and escalation through dedicated sub-committees and the global risk committee to reinforce business accountability and supervisory controls. The firm maintains a comprehensive incident management program and backup and recovery infrastructure—with geographically dispersed workforces and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans—to ensure operational continuity and capacity at scale. Schwab conducts regular liquidity and capital stress testing, maintains early warning indicators, and employs contingency funding and capital contingency plans to absorb significant balance sheet variations driven by client cash reallocations in rising-rate environments or market disruptions. A diversified funding mix—including working capital, client-generated cash flows, FHLB facilities, repurchase agreements, brokered certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and senior notes—supports flexibility and client confidence, while policy limits and stress triggers guide actions to preserve regulatory capital ratios and subsidiary strength. A “through clients’ eyes” strategy and approved risk appetite statements inform decision-making, and investments in technology resilience—including cloud and on-premises redundancies, cybersecurity programs, and continuous enhancements—mitigate operational failures, system interruptions, and evolving fraud threats. Organizationally, Schwab has implemented a structured integration trajectory for the TD Ameritrade acquisition, with extensive planning, phased account transitions, and targeted restructuring efforts to realize synergies while maintaining service levels under adverse conditions. Key liquidity and capital metrics—such as the liquidity coverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, and tier 1 leverage ratio—are actively monitored to ensure preparedness for nominal, extreme, or exceptional market disturbances and the partial maintenance of integrated performance during disruptions.

The Company indicates that failure to allocate research and development resources efficiently or to optimally balance trial design, conduct, and speed to accomplish desired outcomes could impair its ability to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity, and through internal innovation and business development (including licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, distribution and promotion agreements, joint ventures, acquisitions, equity investments, and divestitures) it must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and indications sufficient to replace revenues lost due to pricing controls, loss of intellectual property exclusivity, or competitive displacement, thereby supporting operational flexibility and future orientation. In order to compete successfully and deliver innovative, cost-effective products that meet medical needs and provide value to payers, the Company has expanded, and will likely need to further expand, its workforce, relying on its ability to attract, engage, and retain highly qualified and skilled scientific, technical, management, and other personnel, which underscores the significance of organizational capabilities and human capital in navigating turbulent markets. To protect system integrity and business continuity in the face of cyber-attacks, the Company implements measures “to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our IT systems,” while acknowledging such measures “may not be successful” and that vulnerabilities may remain unremediated. Recognizing that manufacturing and quality assurance difficulties, natural disasters, public health outbreaks, and geopolitical tensions can create supply shortages, the Company is “in the midst of a significant expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and substantial investment in long-term supply agreements” to support current and anticipated demand, although it concedes that tight supplies may persist until capacity increases are operationalized. Reliance on third-party service providers and outsourcing arrangements for clinical trials, active ingredient manufacturing, and distribution introduces risks that third parties “may not perform to our standards or legal requirements,” prompting ongoing risk assessment and contingency planning. To mitigate financial risks from fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, the Company employs derivative financial instruments, noting that “gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities,” thereby preserving its financial resilience. These strategic resource deployments, operational adjustments, and risk management mechanisms reflect an integrated approach to maintaining positive adjustment and strengthening system resilience under challenging conditions.

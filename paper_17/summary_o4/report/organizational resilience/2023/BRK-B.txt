Berkshire’s annual report discloses that the company relies on extensive business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate cybersecurity risks, supply chain disruptions, pandemic‐related interruptions and other operational threats, while maintaining significant liquidity and redundant holdings of cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury bills to preserve financial flexibility.  Its unusually decentralized operating model, supported by formal board‐approved succession plans and highly competent local management teams, enables rapid resource reallocation, operational flexibility and positive adjustment under evolving regulatory, economic, geopolitical and climate‐related pressures.  The firm’s disciplined underwriting practices, retroactive reinsurance arrangements and dynamic premium‐rate adjustments illustrate its systemic approach to absorb catastrophic losses and sustain underwriting performance.  Substantial capital deployment commitments for maintaining and improving its rail network and regulated utility and energy assets further demonstrate a commitment to operational continuity and system integrity.  Robust actuarial reserving methodologies and proactive risk monitoring across all business segments, combined with a long‐term focus on strengthening competitive advantages, collectively underpin Berkshire’s ability to absorb strain, adapt to disruptions and preserve or enhance functioning under challenging conditions.

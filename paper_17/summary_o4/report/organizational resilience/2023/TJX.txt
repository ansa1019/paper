The report underscores the Company’s reliance on adaptive capabilities and strategic resource management to preserve performance under internal and external disruptions, noting, for example, that operating “with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns” and requiring merchants to “effectively react to rapidly changing opportunities and trends in the market,” assess merchandise value, and determine sourcing timing and quantities are critical to maintaining functionality; it highlights the impact of “temporary store closures, inflationary pressures, global supply chain disruptions, and other challenges, as a result of events, including the global COVID-19 pandemic,” thereby illustrating the need for business continuity measures and disaster recovery plans, particularly for information technology systems where reliance on “effective disaster recovery plans” and cybersecurity controls aims to mitigate risks; the discussion of the Company’s “flexible off-price model” credits its ability to respond to market volatility and customer demand shifts, reflecting operational flexibility and strategic agility; references to hedging instruments used to manage transportation and currency exchange costs and the maintenance of strong cash flows and credit facilities demonstrate systemic risk mitigation and financial resilience; and the recognition that “growth can also add complexity to our business operations by requiring effective and timely information sharing; significant additional attention from our management and other functions across our business, including compliance and risk management; development of new capabilities, processes, and controls; increased staffing and associate training; and/or retention and management of appropriate third-party providers” reveals a dynamic approach to capability development, interdepartmental collaboration, and trajectory reconfiguration in response to disruptive events, all aligning with a model of organizational resilience as the “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” and the ability to absorb strain while preserving or improving functioning.

Natural disasters or catastrophes, including public health crises, extreme weather events, climate change, earthquakes, tsunamis and floods, risks of terrorism or civil unrest and pandemics such as COVID-19, could materially inhibit our ability to conduct investment management, insurance and capital markets activities by interrupting travel, access to offices, employee well-being and morale, third-party service provider operations, data processing and recordkeeping, and by depleting infrastructure and emergency response capabilities. Our businesses depend heavily on complex information technology systems, process-intensive manual procedures, interdependent third-party intermediaries and outsourced services, and cyber-security failures or data security breaches—whether through external attacks, system outages or human error—could disrupt or impair our operations, financial reporting, asset valuations and client servicing, and our disaster recovery and business continuation programs may prove insufficient. We also maintain significant liquidity requirements to support investment vehicles, policyholder obligations, underwriting commitments and balance-sheet warehoused positions, and adverse market, economic or credit events—including volatility in debt and equity markets, tightening financing terms, sponsor or counterparty defaults, and collateral calls under derivative and reinsurance arrangements—could constrain our sources of liquidity, force asset dispositions on unfavorable terms, hinder our ability to respond to unexpected business needs and limit our operational flexibility, all of which may materially and adversely affect our resilience and continuity under challenging conditions.

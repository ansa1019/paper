Our disclosures describe how we build and maintain organizational resilience through comprehensive business continuity and risk mitigation measures designed to ensure “positive adjustment under challenging conditions.” We outline contingency planning and crisis management protocols—such as our global purchasing programs, fixed-price contracts, hedging strategies and productivity initiatives—to address supply chain disruptions from geopolitical conflicts (notably Ukraine and the Middle East), natural disasters, pandemics and cyber incidents. Our integrated risk management framework, driven by the Pepsico Risk Committee, divisional and market risk committees, Internal Audit, Compliance & Ethics and our Disclosure Committee, systematically identifies, assesses, prioritizes and monitors evolving strategic, operational, financial and reputational risks and reconfigures resources, systems and processes to preserve performance. Initiatives such as our Pep+ transformation and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan leverage automation, process harmonization and organizational simplification to enhance operational flexibility and resource allocation, while our crisis response and emergency preparedness plans—covering facility risk assessments, cyber defenses, rapid brand and product recall protocols, and workforce safety measures—ensure rapid recovery and continuity of our manufacturing, distribution and digital operations. table of contents implicit in these disclosures is our commitment to systemic resilience through ongoing investment in reconstituting supply chains, deploying strategic initiatives across hierarchical levels, and sustaining organizational health and competitive advantage in turbulent markets.

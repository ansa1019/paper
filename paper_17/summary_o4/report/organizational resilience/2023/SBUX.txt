Starbucks’s disclosures reflect a multifaceted approach to organizational resilience through active risk management of climate change and resource constraints by managing costs across its supply chain, including energy and water resources, and using pricing features and financial derivatives to hedge commodity volatility in coffee, dairy and other inputs. The company’s reinvention plan in the U.S. market is designed to increase efficiency and operational flexibility by investing in partner wages, benefits and training to improve retention and in-store operational efficiencies, accelerating purpose-built store concepts and technology innovations to adapt rapidly to evolving customer preferences and economic conditions, and responding to the persisting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starbucks maintains diversified liquidity via committed credit facilities and commercial paper capacity to support working capital, capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, debt maturities, acquisitions and shareholder returns under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions. To mitigate foreign-exchange and interest-rate risks, the company employs derivative instruments to hedge anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases and debt servicing exposures. In managing international growth, Starbucks balances local autonomy and global consistency, planning for supply chain interruptions caused by pandemics, natural disasters or geopolitical events and addressing macroeconomic, regulatory and social pressures. These resilience strategies—encompassing risk assessment, resource allocation, adaptive strategic responses, continuity planning and financial hedging—are intended to preserve performance and system integrity and enable positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

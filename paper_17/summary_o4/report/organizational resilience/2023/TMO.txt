The Company’s 2023 Form 10-K describes a multifaceted approach to maintaining operational integrity and performance under internal and external variations and disturbances by combining strategic foresight, resource reconfiguration and adaptive response mechanisms.  It highlights significant investments in product development, geographic expansion, research and development funding allocation, service‐offering enhancements, commercial infrastructure and digital platforms to anticipate and respond to market disruptions, cyclical downturns, inflationary pressures and changing customer needs.  The Company pursues productivity improvements and cost savings through its practical process improvement business system, facility consolidations, headcount reductions and continued development of commercial tools and e-commerce capabilities to bolster operational flexibility and preserve financial strength amid lower revenue expectations.  A risk-based approach to information security, disaster recovery planning, third-party due diligence and diversified supply chains seeks to mitigate interruptions from cyber-attacks, natural disasters, public health emergencies and geopolitical instability, while maintaining critical business processes.  The report also emphasizes the maintenance of liquidity and borrowing capacity—retaining undrawn credit to support commercial paper programs—alongside free cash flow generation of $7.0 billion in 2023 and planned capital expenditures of $1.3-1.5 billion in 2024, illustrating the Company’s systemic perspective on resilience as the ability to absorb strain, reconstitute trajectories in immediate response to events and reconfigure for the future, thereby preserving or improving its functioning under challenging conditions.

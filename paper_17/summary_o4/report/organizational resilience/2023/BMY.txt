Bristol-Myers Squibb acknowledges that its product supply and related patient access has been, and could in the future be, negatively impacted by difficulties, delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of its products, including interruptions in supply chain continuity from market forces, natural disasters, global disease outbreaks or pandemics (including COVID-19), acts of war or terrorism or other unforeseeable or unavoidable events, and maintains business continuity plans with suppliers, vendors and alliance partners to support operational flexibility and crisis response. The company regularly assesses its anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage ratio levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance its ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions, including the use of existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, commercial paper borrowings and revolving credit facilities to preserve liquidity for capital expenditures, restructuring initiatives and debt maturities, thereby enabling it to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions. In managing external pressures such as pharmaceutical pricing controls, policy and legislative changes, competitive generic erosion and evolving tax laws, Bristol-Myers Squibb integrates rigorous risk assessment, stress-testing and contingency provisions—including contingent milestone payments, provisions for legal and regulatory exposures and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets—to mitigate financial volatility and ensure compliance. The company’s ESG strategy mobilizes cross-functional collaboration and stakeholder engagement to reinforce organizational health and address environmental, social and governance considerations, while its disciplined operating model, periodic evaluations of critical accounting policies and allocations of enterprise-wide costs support adaptation and resource reconfiguration across commercialization, manufacturing and R&D functions. Furthermore, recognizing its dependency on information technology systems and third-party providers, the firm has implemented cybersecurity controls and incident response frameworks to detect, respond to and recover from cyber intrusions, sustaining system integrity and continuity of critical operations during internal or external disruptions and positioning the organization to emerge more robustly from future challenges.

The company expressly recognizes that “risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted” and therefore seeks to “identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business” to preserve continuity of operations under adverse conditions. It acknowledges that “budget uncertainty, the potential for U.S. government shutdowns, the use of continuing resolutions, and the federal debt ceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs,” potentially leading to “reduced orders, program cancellations and other disruptions and nonpayment,” and that “contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations.” To absorb strain in its complex, multi‐tiered supply chain, the company “manages supply risk through long‐term contracts, identifying domestic or other U.S. allied alternative sources of items and maintaining an acceptable level of our key materials in inventories,” while pursuing “supply chain improvements, continued reliability improvements and other efficiencies” to support customer affordability and sustainment performance. In response to evolving customer requirements and external pressures—ranging from “heightened levels of inflation” and “higher interest rates” to “geopolitical and security issues” such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or export restrictions—it invests in research, development and emerging technologies, implements a “multi‐year business transformation initiative to enhance our digital infrastructure to increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business while reducing costs,” and embraces a hybrid workforce model to maintain operational flexibility and innovation. The firm underscores the importance of “compliance with extensive laws and regulations,” robust cybersecurity risk management, adaptive portfolio‐shaping through acquisitions and divestitures, and proactive due diligence. It also engages in pension risk transfer transactions, environmental remediation planning and offset agreements, all of which reflect a commitment to absorb strain, adapt to dynamic environmental disruptions and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

The company’s disclosures describe a comprehensive set of operational and strategic measures designed to preserve or restore business continuity, absorb and mitigate system‐level failures, and maintain functionality under adverse conditions.  In its risk factors the company warns that its inability to successfully recover from disasters or business continuity events—whether natural (earthquake, hurricane, pandemic), man‐made (terrorist attacks, war, protests, riots), cyber‐related (breaches, ransomware, supply‐chain intrusions), utility failures (power or telecommunications outage) or facility disruptions—could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory action, reputational harm or legal liability.  It emphasizes that its ability to operate in such events hinges on the continued availability of personnel, office facilities and the proper functioning of computer, telecommunications and related systems.  The company further discloses a perpetual program of assessing and improving business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans, key management succession arrangements and capital and liquidity management, acknowledging that a major interruption in one or more key operating areas—particularly in major metropolitan centers or high‐threat regions—could materially interrupt operations even if prior incidents have been managed without a material adverse effect.  In addition, the company details its cyber‐resilience measures and risks, noting that its global information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to evolving external threats (software bugs, malware, nation‐state actors, AI‐enabled attacks, deep‐fakes, advanced persistent threats, phishing, social engineering) and internal threats (fraud, error, misconduct), that its response depends on timely detection, patching, access controls, encryption, monitoring, logging and employee training, and that reliance on third‐party vendors and legacy or newly-acquired systems may limit its control over security and recovery.  It also discusses strategic investments in technology systems, including generative AI and digital platforms, and in workforce, real estate and functional services rationalization intended to enhance operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and service innovation, while recognizing that failure to deploy these technologies effectively or adapt to digital disruption could impair its ability to maintain critical functions and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

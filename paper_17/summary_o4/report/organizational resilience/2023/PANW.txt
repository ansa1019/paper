The Company’s annual report repeatedly underscores its need to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by identifying a wide range of internal and external pressures—from unfavorable economic and geopolitical environments to rapid technological change, cyber threats, and regulatory shifts—that could impair its ability to absorb strain, preserve operational performance, and ensure business continuity. In addressing these challenges, the report describes how management must continuously improve and expand its systems, processes, and controls, allocate resources to scale information technology, financial infrastructure, and human capital, and strengthen risk assessment, emergency management, and crisis response capabilities to prevent fragmentation, adapt to unexpected disruptions in its global supply chain and distribution channels, and reconstitute customer deployments when adverse events occur. The Company acknowledges its reliance on third-party manufacturers and single-source suppliers, seasonal and geographic demand variability, rapid growth-related complexity, evolving cybersecurity requirements, and potential catastrophic events as sources of operational strain that require systemic resilience strategies—such as investments in research and development, the diversification of manufacturing and component sources, the enhancement of cloud-based subscription and support services, and the maintenance of robust liquidity and credit facilities—to safeguard system integrity, support resource reconfiguration, and sustain competitive advantage and organizational health in the face of adversity.

The company’s “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” sections describe its exposure to a wide array of internal and external disturbances—from pandemics, natural disasters and geopolitical events to cyber-attacks, supply-chain interruptions, inflation and regulatory shifts—and note that it has implemented system redundancy and disaster-recovery planning, compliance programs, diversified global operations and liquidity reserves to maintain business continuity, absorb strain and preserve or improve performance under challenging conditions.  It acknowledges the risk that damage to information-technology systems, facilities, distribution networks or sole-source suppliers could disrupt operations, delay production and shipments, increase costs and impair functioning, and it emphasizes its ongoing investments in increased manufacturing capacity, technological innovation and operational flexibility (including the Danaher Business System) to reconfigure resources, mitigate risk, adapt to unexpected demand shifts—such as declines in COVID-19-related product demand—and emerge stronger.  The company further highlights its geographic and industry diversification as a means to buffer against localized economic, political or market perturbations, its use of revolving credit facilities and capital markets to sustain funding for strategic initiatives, and its regular reassessment of working capital, hedging strategies and organizational structures to ensure rapid response, recovery and positive adjustment in the face of evolving pressures.

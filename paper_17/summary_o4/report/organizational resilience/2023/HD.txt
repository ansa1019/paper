In our fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, the company describes a broad set of practices and investments that align with organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions,” encompassing its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning amid competitive, inflationary, environmental and geopolitical pressures. We report significant ongoing investments to execute our interconnected retail strategy—enhancing and expanding our supply chain, modernizing store and distribution facilities, and developing new processes, systems and support—to streamline operations and allocate resources dynamically in response to market fragmentation, shifts in consumer needs, interest‐rate fluctuations, and unexpected events such as cybersecurity incidents, pandemic‐related disruptions, severe weather and geopolitical conflicts. We continually assess and adjust marketing, pricing, promotional and inventory programs, diversify delivery and pickup options, cultivate strategic supplier alliances and expand financing facilities to maintain operational flexibility and business continuity. Our governance framework for data privacy, cybersecurity and responsible sourcing establishes redundant safeguards and recovery mechanisms to mitigate risks from system failures, malicious activity or supplier non-compliance. Supported by disciplined capital allocation, strong liquidity and financing arrangements, cross-functional collaboration, scenario planning and organizational learning, these measures enable rapid adaptation, risk mitigation, strategic reconfiguration and sustained performance under pressure, thereby reinforcing our capacity to respond effectively to disruptions and emerge stronger.

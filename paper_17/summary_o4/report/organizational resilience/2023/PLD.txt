Prologis acknowledges that its operations and structure involve various risks that could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition, including social, geopolitical and economic risks of global operations; supply chain disruptions; volatility in currencies and currency restrictions; public health crises and workforce health challenges; regulatory changes and compliance requirements; environmental and hazardous substance liabilities; climate-related physical and transition risks; cybersecurity attacks and system failures; insurance limitations; and disruptions in global capital and credit markets. The company seeks to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of its portfolio, market research and asset management capabilities; through hedging and financing activities, including natural hedges and derivative contracts, to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposures; and by carrying insurance coverage—subject to customary coverage limitations—while maintaining system redundancy and a disaster recovery plan to mitigate operational interruptions. Prologis also maintains flexible liquidity sources, including unrestricted cash balances, credit facilities and strategic capital commitments via co-investment ventures, to fund acquisitions, developments, capital deployment activities and REIT distribution requirements under varying market conditions, while recognizing that the loss of key personnel, deficiencies in disclosure controls and concentrated sector exposures may impair its ability to adapt to disruptive events and sustain business continuity.

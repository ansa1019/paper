Unfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results, and under difficult economic conditions, consumers may reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases or shifting to lower-priced products, which could reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance. The occurrence or resurgence of global or regional health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related governmental, private-sector and consumer responses could contribute to a recession, depression or global economic downturn. Throughout 2023, the company faced disruptions to our operations due to international conflicts, including volatile commodity markets; logistical, transportation and supply chain disruptions; increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems; reputational risk; heightened risks to employee safety; business disruptions, including labor shortages; reduced availability and increased costs of transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other inputs; and sanctions, export controls and other regulatory actions. We continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business, but some actions may disrupt our operations, deteriorate employee morale, weaken internal control structures and give rise to negative publicity. Achieving our business growth objectives depends on our ability to evolve and improve our existing products through innovation, correctly anticipate customer acceptance and trends, and develop new products, but failure in our innovation activities may impede growth. Disruption of our supply chain—due to shortages of ingredients or packaging, political instability at supplier locations or adverse weather conditions—may increase costs and interrupt product supply, adversely affecting our business. If we do not successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or realize anticipated benefits of joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results could suffer, and challenges in extending our controls, policies and governance structures to newly acquired operations have, at times, resulted in increased costs and negative publicity. Reliance on third-party service providers and bottling partners exposes us to legal, regulatory, reputational and operational risks; failure to select, manage and monitor these relationships or to maintain strategic alignment and adequate pricing and marketing support could impair our business. Labor relations risk—failure to renew collective bargaining agreements or strikes and work stoppages—could impair manufacturing or distribution, disrupt concentrate and syrup supply, reduce revenues and expose us to customer claims. Our product safety and quality management system sets rigorous standards and identifies and mitigates risks, but a widespread product recall could result in significant losses, lost sales and negative publicity. If we are not successful in our digitalization efforts—creating personalized digital consumer experiences, leveraging data, artificial intelligence, automation and digital tools—our ability to increase sales, improve margins and adapt to evolving retail channels may be compromised. Negative publicity concerning product safety, quality, sustainability issues or other reputational matters could damage our brand image, corporate reputation and social license to operate. Success in new product launches requires timely development, global and local standards adherence and effective execution, and failure in these endeavors could adversely affect our results. We rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our revenues; if we are unable to maintain good relationships or if their financial condition deteriorates, our profitability and equity income could be adversely affected. We face risks related to compliance with laws and regulations governing trade sanctions, antitrust, anti-corruption, data privacy and environmental standards; failure to comply could result in fines, penalties, corrective actions, operational disruptions and reputational harm. If we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruptions, cybersecurity incidents or unauthorized access, our operations could be disrupted, we could suffer financial losses and our reputation could be damaged, and we continue to invest in personnel, technologies and training to address these risks. We incur costs to comply with evolving privacy and data protection laws and may be subject to enforcement actions, private litigation and reputational harm for unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Our business is subject to evolving sustainability requirements and stakeholder expectations; failure to achieve our sustainability goals or to demonstrate progress could damage our reputation and reduce investor support. Concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging may reduce demand for our products and increase production and distribution costs, and regulatory or voluntary requirements could further increase costs or require changes in our models. Water scarcity and poor water quality in various regions may increase costs, create capacity constraints and damage our reputation, all of which could adversely affect profitability. Increased demand for food products, decreased agricultural productivity due to weather changes, loss of biodiversity and agricultural regulations may limit availability or increase costs of key agricultural commodities, and failure to implement sustainable agriculture programs could impair our ability to source raw materials and affect our business and results of operations. Climate change, extreme weather events and legal or regulatory responses to greenhouse gas emissions may increase costs, disrupt supply chains, impair production and create long-term adverse impacts on our business. In our quality laboratories, we measure ingredient and finished product attributes rigorously and continually refine our global quality management program to ensure consistency, mitigate risks and drive improvement across more than 200 countries and territories. Our capital allocation priorities—investing to support operations, growing dividends, enhancing our portfolio through consumer-centric acquisitions and repurchasing shares—are designed to preserve liquidity, maintain access to diverse capital markets, optimize our cost of capital and ensure we can generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to fund our strategic initiatives and manage unforeseen challenges.

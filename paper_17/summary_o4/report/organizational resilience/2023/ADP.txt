The company discloses that it has disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect its operations against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, banking system stress or failure and cyberattacks, while acknowledging that these measures may not fully prevent or mitigate data loss, service interruptions or operational disruptions. It maintains programs and processes to prevent, detect and respond to data or cybersecurity incidents, devoting significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and controls in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats, including AI‐driven attacks and state‐sponsored actors, and to comply with evolving privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity regulations and self-regulatory frameworks, such as binding corporate rules and risk-based anti-money laundering programs.

Through broad-based transformation initiatives aimed at streamlining the organization, extending distribution, strengthening talent and culture, and increasing research and development investments, the company seeks to enhance operating efficiencies, strategic agility and innovation in its HCM solutions, continuously upgrading and expanding technology and services—including the integration of AI and machine learning—to meet client needs, sustain competitive advantage and maintain functioning and recovery capability under challenging conditions, supported by strong cash flow generation, low capital intensity and disciplined capital allocation.

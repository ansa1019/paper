The report discloses vulnerability to operational disruptions from cyberattacks, data breaches and other security incidents, noting that “our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information and to defend against cyberattacks seeking to disrupt our operations must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever-evolving threat landscape,” and that “these preventative actions require the investment of significant resources and management time and attention.” It acknowledges that “system failures and business disruptions may prevent us from providing reliable service,” encompassing failures of internal networks, third-party systems, equipment, extreme weather events and other hazards, with remediation costs that “could include liability for information loss, costs of repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers,” while insurance may prove inadequate. The company describes the need to “adapt to changes in available technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing service offerings, and introduce new offerings to meet our current and potential customers’ changing service demands” as critical to preserving performance and competitive advantage under disruptive change. It outlines risks arising from supplier failures—driven by economic, financial, credit, labor, geopolitical and natural-catastrophic events—that “could have a material and adverse effect” and may force short-notice transitions to alternative providers. In detailing its post-merger integration and restructuring, the company identifies contract terminations, network rationalization and decommissioning of legacy systems, severance and associated costs as initiatives intended to “realize cost efficiencies” and “achieve merger synergies in network costs,” thereby preserving functionality and resource allocation in the face of organizational change processes. It further highlights extensive government commitments, evolving regulatory regimes in spectrum use, privacy, consumer protection and public safety, and legal proceedings—including significant litigation and regulatory inquiries stemming from cyberattacks—all of which “could divert our management’s time and energy away from other business operations” and impose additional costs or penalties, thereby testing organizational agility and crisis response capabilities. The report also describes strategic resource deployment through spectrum auctions, license purchase agreements, debt financing, financing lease facilities and securitization of receivables as measures to support network build-out, technology modernization, liquidity and operational flexibility, while emphasizing the maintenance of effective internal controls, governance frameworks and compliance programs to mitigate risk, ensure continuity and uphold performance under pressure.

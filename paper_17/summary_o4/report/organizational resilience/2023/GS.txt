The firmwide operational risk and resilience committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk and seeks to ensure our business and operational resilience, and our resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for business continuity and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption; notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, business disruptions impacting our offices and employees could lead to our employeesâ€™ inability to occupy the offices, communicate with or travel to other office locations or work remotely, and as a result our ability to service and interact with clients may be adversely impacted due to our failure or inability to successfully implement business contingency plans; despite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located; we maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress, and as part of our comprehensive capital management policy we maintain a contingency capital plan that provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including identification of drivers of a capital deficiency as well as mitigants and potential actions; our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities; in connection with our recovery and resolution planning processes, including incorporating feedback from our regulators, we have established a resolution capital adequacy and positioning framework to ensure our major subsidiaries have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity and a triggers and alerts framework to provide the board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for group inc., which in turn may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional long-term debt and may reduce our ability to provide group inc. guarantees or to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient.

The company acknowledges that “our business, financial condition and results of operations are and will remain subject to numerous risks and uncertainties” and that it “could also be affected by other unknown events, factors, uncertainties, or risks that we do not currently consider to be material,” underscoring the need to maintain operational continuity under adverse conditions. It notes that “changes in general economic conditions … may adversely affect us” and concedes that “it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model,” prompting ongoing investments in digital capabilities, network enhancements and a “disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation” to preserve service levels amid inflationary pressures, rapid industry evolution demanding “faster deliveries” and “increased visibility into shipments,” and geopolitical tensions in key regions. The report details investments in “IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery capabilities,” recognizes that “weather conditions or other natural or man-made disasters … have in the past and may in the future disrupt our business,” and identifies climate change as a material operational risk while committing to carbon neutrality by 2050. It describes strategic responses to labor disruptions—stating that following ratification of its Teamsters agreement it “regained approximately 60% of diverted U.S. volume and gained volume from new customers”—and outlines plans to “right-size our business for the future” through workforce realignment, strategic alternatives for underperforming segments and disciplined funding of acquisitions, technology initiatives and hedging programs, all intended to absorb strain, mitigate risk and reconfigure operations to maintain performance under internal and external pressures.

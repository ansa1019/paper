The company’s disclosures describe a variety of risks and the measures taken to maintain continuity and performance under internal and external disturbances. These include extensive efforts to mitigate supply‐chain constraints—such as increasing communications with suppliers, adjusting purchase order coverage and inventory levels, and developing alternative sources—to preserve the timely delivery of components despite single‐source dependencies, inflationary cost pressures, rising interest rates, and potential supplier insolvencies. The company acknowledges that geopolitical instability, tariffs, trade restrictions, and protectionist measures may force costly operational changes, such as altering suppliers or restructuring business relationships, while climate-related extreme weather events, natural disasters, and public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic have led to temporary facility closures, deferred elective procedures, and staffing shortages, testing its ability to absorb strain and reconstitute its operations. To address these challenges, the company invests substantially in its information technology infrastructure, cybersecurity defenses, and hybrid work arrangements to guard against system failures, cyberattacks, and data breaches that could disrupt critical processes. It maintains business insurance programs, self-insures certain liabilities, and continually assesses and adapts its regulatory compliance and risk-management practices—including scenario planning, stress testing, and internal controls—in response to evolving privacy, trade, and healthcare regulations. Collectively, these initiatives reflect a systemic perspective aimed at preserving or improving organizational functioning, operational flexibility, and performance maintenance amid adverse conditions.

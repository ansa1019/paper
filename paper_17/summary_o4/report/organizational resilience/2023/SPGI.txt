We maintain policies, processes and internal controls intended to ensure the stability of our information systems, provide security from unauthorized access and maintain business continuity, supported by disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, but we acknowledge that our systems are not always fully redundant and our disaster planning may not be sufficient or effective. Our operations rely heavily on critical infrastructure—both owned and outsourced—and any system breakdowns, network or telecommunication failures, power loss, natural disasters, climate-related events, public health crises, political unrest, security breaches, cyber attacks, malicious or defective software, or human error could materially interrupt our business, impair our ability to deliver products and services, compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data, require significant resource allocation to mitigate interruptions or cessations of service, and damage our reputation and customer confidence. Cyber threats continue to evolve, defending against denial of service attacks, ransomware, spyware and other sophisticated intrusions originating from diverse sources, and there can be no assurance that measures we or our third-party providers take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats will succeed. We rely on cloud-based systems and third-party service providers whose infrastructure may become obsolete, incompatible with future versions of our products or unavailable, and outsourcing functions introduces risks of compliance failures, unauthorized data disclosures, system or network disruption, regulatory actions and reputational harm. We recognize the need to strengthen the security and resiliency of business-critical systems, eliminate known risk areas, enhance risk management, compliance and recovery mechanisms, and build operational flexibility and dynamic capabilities, but also face the challenge of adapting to evolving legislation and regulatory requirements—such as privacy, data localization, cyber-security and financial benchmark standards—that may impose additional constraints, costs or interruptions on our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions.

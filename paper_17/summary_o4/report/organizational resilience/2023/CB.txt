Chubb manages exposure to natural and man-made catastrophes, including terrorism, cyber-attack, and pandemics, through the use of underwriting controls, risk models, geographic diversification, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance, thereby allocating resources to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. The Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses based on informed estimates and judgments, maintains a disciplined underwriting process with per-occurrence and loss-ratio limits, and limits program sizes for each client to mitigate risk. Investment assets are held in liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration, supported by cash balances, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection to meet unforeseen claim demands, reflecting a systemic perspective on maintaining integrity and performance under internal or external disturbances. Chubb’s profit-center organization grants underwriting autonomy to business units, fostering operational flexibility and enabling rapid reconfiguration of response trajectories to disruptive events. Analytical models are employed in underwriting, claims, reserving, and catastrophe risk assessment to anticipate environmental perturbations, while administrative and technical controls, cybersecurity measures, and stress-testing of political and credit risks serve as resilience strategies against unexpected situations. Regular renewal of its global property catastrophe and terrorism programs, along with the use of diversified capital market financings and cash-pooling arrangements, demonstrates Chubb’s strategic initiatives in resource reconfiguration, risk mitigation, and collaboration networks to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

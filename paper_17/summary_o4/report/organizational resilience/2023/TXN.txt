Management acknowledges that our global operations across more than 30 countries subject us to domestic and international political, social, economic and other conditions—including inflation, security risks, acts of war, terrorism, public health crises, climate-driven natural disasters and disruptions in power, water supply, transportation, communications and information technology networks—any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation, thereby underscoring the need for robust risk mitigation, business continuity planning and supply chain resilience. We are susceptible to macroeconomic weakness affecting customer demand and to foreign-currency fluctuations, and we must respond rapidly to intense technological and pricing competition, which demands operational flexibility, dynamic capabilities and innovation to preserve performance under pressure. Our ability to match manufacturing forecasts to product mix and strategically build inventory serves to buffer demand volatility, while significant investments in research and development, capital expenditures for semiconductor manufacturing capacity, and disciplined capital allocation aim to strengthen our competitive advantages, enhance operational continuity and resource reconfiguration, and maintain long-term free cash flow per share. We rely on diversified manufacturing and technology foundations to lower costs and improve supply chain control and on a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products to reduce single-point dependency, reflecting a systemic perspective on organizational resilience. Our strategic focus on analog and embedded processing, segment resource allocation based on design, development and distribution considerations, and investments to support sustainable competitive advantages demonstrate efforts to absorb strain, adapt to external perturbations and preserve functioning despite adversity. We maintain liquidity through cash flow from operations, cash equivalents, short-term investments and undrawn revolving credit facilities to ensure we can fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends and debt obligations for at least the next twelve months, thereby enhancing financial resilience and preparedness for unexpected conditions. Continuous attention to cybersecurity defenses, supplier diversification, talent retention and succession planning, compliance with evolving laws and regulations, and responsiveness to geopolitical tensions and trade barriers further illustrate our multifaceted approach to risk assessment, crisis management and organizational adaptability in volatile environments.

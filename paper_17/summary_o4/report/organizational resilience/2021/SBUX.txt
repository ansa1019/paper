Starbucks’ Form 10-K highlights the extensive deployment and criticality of its information technology systems—whether cloud-based or hosted on proprietary servers—which underpin point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services, rewards programs, administrative functions and supply chain operations. The Company emphasizes significant investments in technology infrastructure, third-party services and specialized personnel to develop, implement and maintain these systems, to anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks, and to safeguard customer, employee and proprietary data with appropriate levels of security, confidentiality, reliability and access. Starbucks notes that any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of these IT systems could disrupt operations, impair operational efficiency, hinder its digital growth initiatives—such as convenience-led store formats that depend heavily on mobile ordering capabilities—and adversely affect financial results. The report also describes the firm’s reliance on digital and mobile capabilities to drive brand engagement and digital relationships through its mobile app, loyalty and delivery channels, and underscores ongoing efforts to manage and comply with evolving global data privacy and cybersecurity regulations—including GDPR, CCPA and emerging state and foreign privacy laws—as part of its overall information management capability to provide timely, accurate and tailored data in support of strategic resource allocation, business process optimization and competitive positioning.

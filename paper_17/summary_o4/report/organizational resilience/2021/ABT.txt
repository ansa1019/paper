Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations; similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption; these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks, and third-party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen, which could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties; Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings, and is subject to regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders; Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment, but there can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future; similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott; any significant breach, attack or other disruption involving Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business.

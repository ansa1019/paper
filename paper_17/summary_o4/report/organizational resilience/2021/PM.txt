Our operations increasingly rely on third-party resources and subcontractors to manufacture electronic devices and accessories and to support our finance, commercialization and information technology processes, and while these arrangements improve efficiencies and decrease operating costs, they diminish our direct control over supply chain quality, operational flexibility and speed of market response; the failure of our information systems or those of our business partners to function as intended, or their penetration by malicious actors, could disrupt business continuity, impair process performance, compromise data management practices including information accuracy, timeliness, security, confidentiality and connectivity, prompt litigation and regulatory actions under privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, damage our reputation and brands, and result in loss of revenue, assets or intellectual property; accordingly, we are continuously evolving our business continuity planning, backup protocols and digital infrastructure resilience to mitigate an increasing cyber-threat landscape and data governance challenges as we expand reliance on digital platforms, information systems capability and digital transformation initiatives in support and enhancement of our strategic resource deployment and competitive positioning.

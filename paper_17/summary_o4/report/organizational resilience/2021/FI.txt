Our operations depend on information technology capabilities that encompass the acquisition, deployment, integration and reconfiguration of hardware, software, data and network resources to support and enhance our business strategies and work processes, including account processing and digital banking solutions, card issuer processing and network services, merchant acquiring and point-of-sale technology such as the Clover cloud-based POS and CaratSM omnichannel commerce platforms, e-commerce, mobile payment services and non-card digital payment software for billing, funds transfer and fraud protection. We recognize multi-element contracts over time or upon delivery, with infrastructure costs, customer support, software application maintenance and depreciation of devices reflected in cost of processing and services, and software licenses, hardware sales and card production captured as product revenue. We rely on third-party payment card networks, acquiring processors, automated clearing houses, technology hosting facilities and device manufacturers to deliver scalable, non-discretionary services under stand-ready obligations, and any disruption to our supply chain, workforce shortages in software development or hosting, or failure of business continuity plans could impede service levels or contractual performance. Our risk management and MD&A disclosures underscore continuous investment in information security and controls, business continuity and disaster-recovery plans to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security and connectivity of sensitive data against cyberattacks, operational failures or regulatory requirements such as PCI DSS and GDPR. We anticipate and respond to rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards, and have expanded our digital infrastructure through acquisitions and integrations of platforms such as BentoBox, NetPay, Pineapple Payments, SpendLabs, Radius8 and OnDot to enhance our digital commerce, mobile-native and cloud-native banking capabilities, while pursuing synergies in IT architecture, process automation and operational efficiency to deliver differentiated value, support high transaction volumes and maintain competitive advantage in the global payments landscape.

Our omnichannel strategy recognizes that customers increasingly use computers, tablets, mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and to provide feedback, requiring customer-facing technology systems that function as designed, provide a consistent customer experience, and enable personalized data delivery within evolving data privacy and security frameworks. To support this, we invest in, maintain and continually improve information systems underpinning sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment, and we leverage third-party vendors for digital storage technology and content delivery. We have enhanced the online experience through improved search and navigation functionality and expanded visualization and configuration tools and expanded omnichannel fulfillment with a market-based delivery model that bypasses stores and offers real-time tracking and same-day or next-day options. In our stores, perpetual productivity improvement initiatives have driven the deployment of a new inventory management system granting associates real-time visibility to stock and a simplified user interface that reduces non-productive tasks and accelerates training. These complex, technology-driven programs require integrated planning, initiative prioritization, sequencing and the attraction and retention of skilled technology professionals. We also acknowledge the risk that our financial performance could be materially harmed if we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand our own or third-party information systems, prevent or respond to cybersecurity incidents, or comply with emerging global privacy and data security regulations, any of which could result in data loss, service disruptions, reputational damage, increased costs and potential liability.

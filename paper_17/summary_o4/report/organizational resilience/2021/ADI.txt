During the integration of the Maxim acquisition, management has devoted significant attention and resources to combining a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems and has incurred substantial facilities and systems consolidation costs, reflecting the coordination of internal assets, work processes and interfirm relationships.  The spread of COVID-19 compelled modifications to business practices—restricting employee travel, shifting work locations and canceling physical meetings—thereby requiring many employees to work remotely and underscoring the firm’s reliance on its information technology infrastructure and external cloud providers to support critical functions such as financial record-keeping, customer data management, order processing, inventory control, shipment coordination, semiconductor engineering and internal and external communications.  We recognize that damage, disruptions or shutdowns of these IT systems—whether from power outages, hardware or telecommunications failures, employee or third-party malfeasance, user errors or other unforeseen events—could materially impair business operations, impede market responsiveness and erode customer relationships, while security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could jeopardize information confidentiality, reliability, security and access.  These considerations reflect the firm’s ongoing commitment to mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational resources and capabilities to support business strategies, maintain operational flexibility and mitigate the risks posed by external influences and technological challenges.

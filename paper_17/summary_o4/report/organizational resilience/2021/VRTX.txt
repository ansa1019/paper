We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business and in the course of our business collect, store, and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), making secure handling critical to maintain data confidentiality and integrity. We recognize that a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers—whether caused by software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents—could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to private and governmental claims. While we have implemented security measures to minimize these risks and have adopted a business continuity plan to address potential disruptions, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches or that our liability insurance will cover claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other related liabilities. We note that cyber-attacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity—often carried out by well-resourced nation states, organized crime groups, “hacktivists” and malicious insiders—and now include manufacturing, hardware or software supply chain attacks that could delay product manufacturing or lead to data privacy or security breaches. The shift to remote work amid the COVID-19 pandemic further increases our vulnerability to cybersecurity threats such as phishing attacks, particularly where employees, third-party vendors and collaborators operate on non-corporate managed networks. In this context, we are subject to an evolving framework of data privacy and security laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions—including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law—that govern the collection, storage, use, sharing, cross-border transfer and breach-notification of personal data and impose enhanced standards of consent, transparency, contractual requirements with data processors and individual data rights. Different EU member states have interpreted the GDPR differently, adding complexity to compliance, and the regulation imposes strict rules on transfers of data outside the EU and authorizes significant penalties for violations. Compliance with these data protection regimes is rigorous and time-intensive, may increase our cost of doing business or require changes to our business practices, and failure to comply could expose us to enforcement actions, private rights of action and substantial fines or other penalties.

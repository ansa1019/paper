As a cloud-based service provider, we optimize performance of our products and services by utilizing data centers located in, and support provided from, different jurisdictions, and we have made significant investments to obtain and maintain cloud security authorizations and certifications such as the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) High Provisional Authority to Operate and the Department of Defense Impact Level 4 P-ATO, recognizing that changing laws, regulations and standards related to data privacy, residency and transfer may require us to modify our data handling practices at substantial operational cost. We participate in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets that demand continuous innovation in digital capabilities—such as AI, machine learning, hyper-automation, low-code/no-code application development, system observability, database scalability and consumer-grade user experiences—and to sustain competitive advantage we must identify and invest in emerging technologies, continually optimize our own technology platform, deliver scalable platform and database products, efficiently integrate with customers’ digital environments, and provide digital transformation process planning, IT systems architecture planning and product implementation services through our partner ecosystem. Our operations involve the storage, transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential, proprietary and sensitive data, and while we have security measures and a data governance framework in place to protect information and prevent data loss, we devote significant financial and personnel resources to maintain these measures amid increasingly sophisticated cyber-security threats, digital supply chain attacks and rising volumes of remote access. We serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and co-located in third-party data centers around the world, fully aware that disruptions, defects or perceived flaws in our platform can damage customer operations, slow adoption of new technologies and undermine the reliability and efficiency of business workflows. The Now Platform enables customers to connect systems, silos, departments and processes with digital workflows that transform non-integrated, manual and disconnected processes into integrated enterprise technology solutions with automation and connected activities, increasing organizational resiliency, security and the delivery of enhanced experiences and value across the enterprise.

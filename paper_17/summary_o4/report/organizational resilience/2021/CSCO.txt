We are integrating our platforms across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud, and these platforms are designed to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks, enabling a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business; we believe that our customers are looking for outcomes that are data-driven and provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments; our strategy is to help our customers connect, secure, and automate in order to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world; we have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and, as part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers; the process of developing new technology—including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market transitions such as security, digital transformation, IoT, and cloud—is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed; for example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours—such as networking products based on “white box” hardware—our business could be harmed; the recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges and could impact our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services and hold product sales and marketing events to the extent we were able to previously; we provided a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as customers dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote; evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border transmission of data, including regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers’ ability to use, and our ability to sell, our products and offers.

Our disclosures emphasize that our operational performance and risk management critically depend on information technology capabilities, as our businesses are “highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies,” and that “developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging” as electronic transaction volume, speed and complexity increase and real-time reporting requirements emerge. We recognize the need to “continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets, and invest heavily in systemic controls and training” to prevent errors or compliance breaches. Our use of credit underwriting models and other quantitative tools underscores the centrality of analytics in our decision-making processes. We have invested significant resources to address risks inherent in computing devices, networks and cloud technologies, including “cyber attacks, inherent technological defects, system failures and human error,” and have enhanced our “protective measures” and remedial capabilities, yet “there may still be residual security risks.” We also acknowledge the growing importance of distributed ledger technology and the need to manage exposures arising from blockchain-based products and digital assets. Moreover, we routinely transmit “personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means” and continue to strengthen our client-facing and internal IT architecture to ensure appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access, in line with evolving business needs, while mitigating third-party vulnerabilities, system integration challenges and continuity requirements.

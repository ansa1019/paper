Alphabet Inc. discloses that its complex information technology and communications systems, including data centers, servers and network equipment, are critical to delivering its products and services, and that any interruption, interference, modification or failure—whether from system upgrades, natural disasters, power loss, malware attacks, software vulnerabilities, non-redundant configurations or other operational challenges—could harm its reputation, financial condition and operating results. The company relies extensively on these information systems to manage its business processes and summarize operating results and is undertaking a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system designed to maintain accurate financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely management information; any failure in the design, implementation or operation of this ERP could impair internal controls over financial reporting and adversely affect its business. To support its rapid technological evolution and competitive positioning, Alphabet continues to invest significant resources in research and development—including through acquisitions—in order to enhance technology across new and existing products and services, and devotes capital to build and maintain technical infrastructure and enterprise-ready cloud services (Google Cloud Platform and Workspace) while scaling related organizational capabilities and talent; it further emphasizes anticipating technology developments and delivering innovative, relevant and useful products, services and technologies in a timely manner to adapt to shifting user needs and market dynamics.

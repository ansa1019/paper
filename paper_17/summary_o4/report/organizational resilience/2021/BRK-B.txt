Berkshire Hathaway discloses that it relies on technology in virtually all aspects of its business and that certain of its information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks and expects to be subject to similar attacks as they become more sophisticated and frequent. The Company cautions that a significant disruption or failure of its technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties, and that attacks perpetrated against its systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose it to remediation costs and reputational damage. Although steps have been taken to mitigate these risks through business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, Berkshire Hathaway warns that a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of its significant operations could adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The Company further notes that if it is unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage that could also adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity, and that cyber-attacks could further impair its ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Berkshire Hathaway also acknowledges that political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with its operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or materially adverse effects in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Finally, the Company highlights that data privacy regulations recently enacted in various jurisdictions address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information stored in its information systems, networks and facilities, and that failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties.

Danaher’s business operations rely heavily on information technology systems, including third-party provided or managed platforms, to process, transmit and store sensitive electronic information—ranging from confidential business data to personal health and customer information—and to support critical activities such as order receipt and fulfillment, billing, payment processing, shipping, customer support and contractual obligations, while certain remote-monitoring products and services incorporate software and IT connectivity that house personal data and link back to Danaher’s central systems for maintenance. The company faces evolving cybersecurity and data-privacy risks—including potential failures of system redundancy and disaster-recovery plans, heightened exposure from an increasingly remote workforce, sophisticated threats such as viruses, ransomware and unauthorized access, and attacks on hardware, software and data embedded in third-party infrastructures—which can interrupt Danaher’s and its customers’ operations, delay production and shipments, compromise intellectual property or personal data, trigger product recalls or field actions and expose Danaher to fines, civil and criminal penalties under HIPAA, GDPR and other global privacy and security laws, all of which can erode customer, patient and partner relationships, damage the company’s reputation and increase security and remediation costs. In addition, Danaher must continuously invest significant resources to maintain, enhance and upgrade its IT infrastructure, digital capabilities and software development lifecycles to keep pace with rapid technological changes—such as computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity and digitization—evolving legal and regulatory standards, customer expectations and business strategies, and to innovate and commercialize new IT-enabled products and services; any inability to effectively govern, align or scale these technology resources, data analytics, connectivity and digital infrastructures with changing market dynamics and strategic objectives could impair the company’s competitive positioning, operational flexibility, market responsiveness and overall firm performance.

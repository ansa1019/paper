T-Mobile’s disclosures underscore the critical role of its information technology capabilities in coordinating network assets, supporting business processes and interfirm transactions, and highlight the firm’s reliance on both its own and third-party systems and networks to provide and support services. The company recognizes that its business involves the receipt, storage and transmission of confidential customer information and that unauthorized access to its IT and business systems or to the networks and critical infrastructure of its suppliers and service providers is difficult to anticipate, detect or prevent, particularly as cyber-attack methods constantly evolve. It acknowledges that it and its third-party service and equipment providers are subject to state-sponsored and malicious actors exploiting bugs, misconfigurations or social engineering to compromise data confidentiality, integrity or availability, and that the pandemic’s shift to work-from-home arrangements has increased operational and cybersecurity risks to its IT systems. As a result, it engages industry experts, has established a cyber transformation office reporting to the CEO, and continually evaluates and enhances safeguards against attacks seeking to disrupt services—actions that require substantial ongoing resource investment. The company also depends heavily on diverse suppliers for software development services, billing and customer support systems, and network components, and cautions that failures or integration difficulties with these complex IT and communications infrastructures could lead to major system or business disruptions, prevent reliable service delivery, disrupt billing and customer retention, and adversely affect operations, financial condition and reputation. In connection with the Sprint merger, T-Mobile is maintaining multiple billing platforms pending migration of legacy customers to its existing system and warns that unanticipated difficulties or delays in this IT integration effort, including errors, cyber-attacks or operational disruptions, could negatively impact service provision, billing accuracy, customer acquisition and overall customer experience.

Our disclosures emphasize that our enterprise cloud computing services depend on the coordination and continuous evolution of our IT infrastructure—including third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, software systems and the underlying internet infrastructure—and that unauthorized access, service interruptions, capacity constraints or defects across proprietary, third-party and open-source components can impair delivery, diminish demand and harm our reputation, operations and financial results. We face the operational challenge of planning and managing infrastructure capacity requirements, early adopting new technologies and enhancing our data center and test environments to scale with growth, while integrating and standardizing acquired IT environments to meet our quality, security and brand standards. To mitigate cyber risks and regulatory requirements around privacy, data residency and cross-border transfers, we maintain and improve business and data governance policies, internal security controls and disaster-recovery arrangements, and our board, cybersecurity committee and executive management receive regular updates on cybersecurity strategies, incident response capabilities and evolving breach techniques. We invest substantially in our IT capability—capitalizing and amortizing costs to obtain contracts, recruiting and retaining skilled personnel, and increasing research and development, marketing, sales and professional services headcount—to support and enhance our Customer 360 platform, Slack digital headquarters and other service offerings by mobilizing IT resources, management skills and organizational processes. We also replicate production environments across multiple facilities, automate processes, upgrade or replace internal software systems, manage the integration of acquisitions, and tailor connectivity, information provisioning, reliability and access controls in response to changing business needs, all in service of driving digital transformation, customer success and competitive advantage in a dynamic global market.

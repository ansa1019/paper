If we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or to successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our operations depend on the integrity, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access of the health care data we use to serve our members, customers and professionals and to operate our business. Connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including sophisticated mobile applications. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. We periodically consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities as a result of technology initiatives, regulatory mandates, system platform changes and acquisitions, and failure to protect, consolidate or integrate these systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy. Certain of our businesses sell and install software products which may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter complications during installation or when used with other technologies, and a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Uncertain and rapidly evolving laws and regulations related to health data and health information technology may alter the competitive landscape or present compliance challenges and could materially affect the configuration of our information systems and platforms and our ability to compete. If we sustain cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents resulting in security breaches or unintended dissemination of protected personal or proprietary information, we could suffer revenue losses, increased costs, significant liability, reputational harm and other negative consequences. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including data outside of the United States, and although we have programs intended to detect, contain and respond to security incidents and provide employee awareness training, sophisticated attackers may penetrate our controls, create system disruptions or exploit vulnerabilities, which could negatively affect our operations. Hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects or other problems compromising information security, and reliance on third-party vendors to process, store and transmit data subjects us to similar risks. The costs to eliminate or address security threats and vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be material, and remediation efforts may not be successful, potentially resulting in interruptions, delays or cessation of service and loss of customers. If we fail to protect our proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products, our ability to market our knowledge and information-related businesses could be hindered and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Failure to comply with applicable privacy, security and data laws, regulations and standards—whether federal, state, international or industry-imposed, including HIPAA requirements and emerging frameworks such as the EU’s GDPR and Brazilian privacy legislation—could increase operating costs, constrain or require us to alter our business model, result in findings of noncompliance, mandatory disclosure, loss of customers, material fines, penalties or litigation and damage our reputation. Several of our businesses act as business associates to covered entities, maintaining and disclosing protected personal information to provide services, and HHS audit programs could reveal compliance deficiencies. Through our Optum businesses, we maintain a large database of administrative and clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards, and any noncompliance or breach could materially and adversely affect our reputation, result in mandatory media disclosure, loss of customers, increased remediation costs and significant fines or penalties. Finally, we work together with clinicians to leverage our data and analytics to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes, reflecting our ongoing investment in digital infrastructure, information management capability and technology-enabled business processes to support strategic objectives, operational efficiency and competitive positioning.

The company discloses that it is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure and cloud service providers to conduct critical manufacturing, research, sales and administrative operations, with certain elements managed, hosted or provided by third parties, thereby extending its coordination of internal assets and interfirm relationships into its IT capability. It reports that in 2017 a network cyber-attack disrupted its worldwide operations and warns that future cyber-attacks could expose confidential information, modify or destroy critical data, interrupt key business processes and compromise intellectual property or trade secrets. The company further acknowledges that misuse of its IT systems, including social media and mobile messaging platforms, may lead to brand damage, information leakage or legal liability from improper collection or dissemination of personally identifiable or sensitive data. In response, the company has pursued modernization of its IT architecture and resiliency efforts to strengthen recovery capabilities, adopted ongoing monitoring of data flows, system usage and personnel access, and implemented enterprise-wide policies governing digital channels, while noting that these measures may not always prevent unauthorized intrusions, degradation or manipulation of its IT environment.

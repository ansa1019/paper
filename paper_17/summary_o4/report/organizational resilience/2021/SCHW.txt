The company’s 2021 Form 10-K emphasizes that its ability to deliver client services and sustain growth is critically dependent on the competence of its technology systems and infrastructure, including its website and mobile applications, cloud platforms, telecommunications networks, software applications and connections to outsourced service providers. Management reports that remote-work arrangements and intermittent service interruptions have at times increased response and processing times, and that system outages, software flaws, capacity constraints, third-party linkages, human error or cyberattacks could result in unauthorized access, data loss, degraded performance or extended recovery periods, all of which may harm client satisfaction and operational efficiency. To address these risks, the firm maintains a comprehensive information security program of tools, controls, policies and training to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of client and corporate data, while acknowledging that evolving threat vectors and increasing fraud sophistication present ongoing challenges. In support of its business strategy and a major acquisition integration, the company invested $559 million in capitalized software development and $340 million in information technology and telecommunications equipment in 2021, reflecting its focus on enhancing system capacity, stability, scalability and service quality—underscoring the importance of mobilizing and reconfiguring IT resources to support business processes, strengthen resilience and enable future growth.

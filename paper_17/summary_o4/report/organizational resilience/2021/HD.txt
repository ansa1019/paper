The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing the level of competition we face, and our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options, and costs depends in part on leveraging the momentum of our strategic investments in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capabilities to further enhance the customer shopping experience. We rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, analyze, process, store, manage, transmit, and protect transactions and data, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers (including cloud platform providers), and we depend heavily on the integrity, security, and consistent access to operational and financial data—for sales, customer and associate data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer service, and post-purchase matters. To operate effectively, these IT systems, applications, and processes must be maintained, updated, upgraded, and patched by us or our service providers, and delays or failures in such maintenance can impair their effectiveness or expose us to security risks; moreover, our systems and those of our third-party partners have on occasion experienced damage or interruption from power outages; telecommunications failures; natural disasters; pandemics; cyber-attacks, including malicious code, phishing, spyware, denial of service, ransomware, data theft or misuse; or design or usage errors. We are making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure, and personnel, in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other third-party service providers, which involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems, migrating applications to the cloud, outsourcing certain technology and business processes, enhancing or maintaining existing systems, or acquiring new systems; these efforts carry risks of system failures or malfunctions, data loss or corruption, changes in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns, implementation delays or errors, and disruption of operations, any of which could impede our ability to meet business and reporting requirements and adversely affect our financial performance. Disruptions, delays, failures, or other performance issues with our customer-facing technology systems or digital platforms—through which we provide online and in-store purchasing options, share product and project information, offer inspiration, and host online communities, digital knowledge centers, and user-friendly interfaces—could impair the benefits these systems provide, give rise to negative customer experiences, and negatively affect our sales and customer relationships. As more business activities have shifted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as many of our store support associates continue to work remotely or in hybrid environments, we face an increased risk of internal or external information technology infrastructure failures as well as heightened cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks. Our business involves the collection, processing, storage, management, transmission, and deletion of sensitive customer, associate, supplier, and company information, and our information systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to an evolving threat landscape of data protection and cybersecurity risks; hardware, software, or applications may contain exploitable vulnerabilities or defects; our software development and implementation processes remain at risk of coding and process vulnerabilities and hidden back doors; and the expanded attack surface created by remote work environments and nation-state or cyber-crime actors using sophisticated, constantly evolving attack vectors may evade detection for significant periods. Although we implement and regularly review systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access, data loss, and integrity breaches, there is no guarantee these measures will be adequate, and any significant compromise or breach of our data security could result in substantial costs to investigate and remediate, lost sales, fines, litigation, regulatory investigations, reputational harm, and reduced trust among customers, associates, suppliers, and regulators. In addition, the regulatory environment governing data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly evolving and becoming more rigorous, requiring significant effort, cost, changes to business practices, and potential limitations on our ability to obtain data for personalized customer experiences; failure to comply could result in fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, lawsuits, or reputational damage, and our cyber insurance coverage may not be adequate for liabilities or costs actually incurred. We also rely on third-party providers for payment processing services and accept a variety of payment methods subject to payment network rules, data security standards, and certification requirements; breaches or noncompliance could increase operating costs through higher interchange or transaction fees, fines, liabilities for costs incurred by issuing banks, impair our ability to facilitate certain payment types, and erode customer confidence. These practices and investments underscore our ongoing commitment to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources to support our business strategies and work processes, mobilize IT-based resources alongside other organizational capabilities, and tailor our information management capabilities—accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access—in response to changing business needs and directions.

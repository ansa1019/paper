AbbVie acknowledges that it depends on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business and to support modified practices such as remote work instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that a failure of those systems could have a material adverse effect on its operations.  These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown, any of which may cause sensitive data—including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners—to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, impair critical business operations and result in loss of revenue, legal, financial, reputational or business harm and substantial remediation costs.  Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology infrastructure and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches in its IT capability, which is essential to coordinate the firm’s assets, internal processes and external relationships in support of its strategic and operational objectives.

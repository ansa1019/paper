At times, the company has required substantially all of its employees to work remotely. The company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions, and system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, while the company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of products. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data, and has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including encryption and authentication technologies; however, third parties can fraudulently induce its employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can be used for unauthorized access, and although multifactor authentication is deployed and accounts may be frozen under suspicious circumstances, these measures may delay or impede customer access. The company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis, and while insurance coverage is maintained for certain aspects of data security risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or claims that may arise. The company distributes third-party applications through its App Store, retaining a commission from sales of applications and digital services or goods within applications, and from time to time has made changes to its App Store in response to competition, market and legal conditions; new legislative initiatives, such as the proposed EU Digital Markets Act, could require further changes, including how and to what extent developers are charged for platform access and how distribution of apps outside the App Store is managed. Some third-party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions, and if requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions at reasonable cost and in a timely manner, without assurance of success.

Stryker reports that it relies extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—including internet sites, cloud and SaaS solutions, data hosting and processing facilities, hardware, software (including open source) and related technical applications and platforms, some managed or hosted by third-party providers—to conduct its business and support its operating and financial processes. The company acknowledges numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats to the security of its IT systems, networks and product offerings and to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data, noting that a security breach of its products, customer networks or third-party hosting services could impair product use, compromise stored information and expose it to reputational, competitive, regulatory or legal harm despite investments in network and systems monitoring, hiring of security experts, employee training and security policies. It further observes that increased remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened cyber-liability risks. Stryker is implementing a new global enterprise resource planning system to replace many existing operating and financial systems and warns that any design or implementation disruptions could adversely affect order processing, product shipments, service delivery, customer support, invoicing, payment tracking and contractual performance. Lastly, the company emphasizes its obligation to comply with comprehensive global privacy, data protection and data security regulations—such as HIPAA, HITECH and the EU’s GDPR—which impose requirements on the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personally identifiable healthcare information and may entail significant costs to monitor compliance or alter practices as interpretations and enforcement evolve.

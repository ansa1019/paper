Boeing discloses that it manages extensive information and information technology systems—both internally and on behalf of certain customers and suppliers—and maintains a comprehensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of its data and IT infrastructure. The company warns that threats to these systems, including cyber-attacks, unauthorized intrusions or failures of information technology, could result in significant financial losses, reputational harm or operational disruptions, as could any destruction, manipulation or improper use of Boeing’s or its suppliers’ data, information systems or networks. Boeing further notes that business continuity depends on resilient technology capabilities, since disruptions—whether from IT system failures, cyber incidents, extreme weather or other events—can delay production, impede the delivery of products and services, strain its supply chain and adversely affect its sales, cash flows and overall customer support.

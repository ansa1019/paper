Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology, network connectivity and access to data and applications, and the networking market’s rapid evolution—fuelled by virtualization and cloud computing—drives demand for our cloud networking solutions, which consist of our extensible operating system (EOS), network applications and ethernet switching and routing platforms designed to deliver high performance, scalability, availability, programmability, workload orchestration, automation and visibility. We continue to invest heavily in software development to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership, while ensuring our products interoperate with operating systems, software applications and hardware developed by others. We rely on our IT systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations—from internal operations and product development to marketing, sales and customer communications—and employ inventory management systems and supply-chain visibility tools to forecast and manage extended lead-time components. We provide access to selected source code, open application programming interfaces and formats to partners for co-development, and our security platform depends on timely updates to detect, report and block security threats, all in support of our ongoing efforts to mobilize, deploy and leverage IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to meet changing business needs and enhance competitive advantage.

Our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service, underscores the critical role of our information technology capabilities in supporting and enhancing our business processes. We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, including subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and as the amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power to satisfy our needs and scale our operations. Our cost of revenue includes depreciation of servers, network infrastructure, and buildings, energy and bandwidth costs, and partner traffic acquisition expenses, while our research and development outlays encompass facilities-related costs for engineering and technical teams responsible for developing and improving our products and investments in new and emerging technologies such as virtual and augmented reality. We plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical personnel to support our research and development initiatives and to increase our investment in both our family of apps and Reality Labs. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, and standards that we do not control, such as Android and iOS, and any changes, bugs, or technical issues in those systems or in our relationships with system partners could degrade product functionality, limit our ability to update or distribute our apps, impede our capacity to deliver, target, or measure ads, or otherwise impair operational flexibility. A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties over which we exercise limited control, and any disruption or failure in these services could significantly harm our ability to handle traffic and materially adversely affect our business. Our products and internal systems rely on highly technical and complex software and hardware that can contain errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or design defects that may only become evident after full utilization, and our inability to prevent or quickly remediate security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of user data, or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation, expose us to regulatory actions, and diminish user trust. Moreover, global expansion of our technical projects is subject to potential delays or disruptions from supply chain shortages, component availability, geopolitical challenges, government actions, and natural disasters, which may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, or service interruptions. Ensuring the accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access of information across our platforms highlights the importance of mobilizing and deploying our IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to support our mission and maintain our competitive position.

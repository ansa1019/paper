The report discloses that the Company maintains a system of controls over the physical security of its facilities and “processes, stores, and transmits large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information,” highlighting its need to provide information with appropriate levels of accuracy, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and to tailor these capabilities as business needs change; it warns that “unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns, including through cyberattacks,” underscoring the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other resources to support and enhance operations. The discussion of COVID-19 mitigation—“working from home, limiting the number of meeting attendees, reducing the number of people in certain of our sites at any one time”—implicitly reflects reliance on IT systems to sustain business continuity and remote collaboration. The Company further recognizes that its development of “system-level products” increasingly depends on “sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization” and ongoing controller, hardware, and firmware updates to meet customer specifications, evidencing IT capability in managing complex product lifecycles, change management, and integration of technology functionalities. Finally, the detailed risks concerning disruptions to manufacturing operations—from “delays in obtaining materials, equipment, labor, engineering services, government permits, or any other essential aspect of projects” to “disruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing and transportation of materials, components, equipment and engineering support” across multiple global sites—implicitly call for coordinated IT-based resource allocation, monitoring systems, and data analytics to manage interfirm transactions and maintain operational flexibility in response to external influences.

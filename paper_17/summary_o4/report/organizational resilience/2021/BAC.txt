Our operations rely on the security, reliability and adequacy of our operational and security systems infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management systems, emerging technologies and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, and a failure or breach of these systems or of our business continuity plans could disrupt critical business operations and customer services, expose us to additional risk, and cause legal or reputational harm. A cyberattack, information or security breach, or a technology failure—of our own or a third party—could impair our ability to conduct our business, manage our exposure to risk, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential information and increase operational and critical infrastructure costs. The introduction, deployment and management of changes to our governance and financial processes, existing products, services and technology, and the implementation of new systems entails significant costs and creates risks associated with integration and potential business interruptions. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic we have become increasingly dependent on remote-access tools and employees’ personal systems, driving greater data utilization and heightened reliance on our information technology infrastructure to operate our businesses from remote locations and to support evolving customer preferences for digital banking and other digital services. We regularly update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with global laws, rules and regulations, and we employ multilayered controls, including access management and secure collection, processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and personally identifiable information across our networks and those of third parties, in the face of evolving regulatory and industry frameworks such as GDPR, CCPA and CPRA. The proliferation of third-party financial data aggregators and emerging technologies, including our use of automation, artificial intelligence and robotics, further increases our cybersecurity risks and underscores the critical importance of effective change management, quality data management and business continuity planning for operational resilience, risk management and compliance.

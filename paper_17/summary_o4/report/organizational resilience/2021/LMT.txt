Our financial disclosures indicate that we continue to invest in information technology to support both our mission‐critical programs and our general enterprise operations, with capital expenditures in 2021 including costs for information technology infrastructure and the development or purchase of internal-use software; we also noted that information systems and software development remain key components of program execution, as exemplified by scheduling software development milestones and addressing software-related performance challenges on our F-35 program; furthermore, our recognition of a non-cash charge in 2020 related to the former Information Systems & Global Solutions business—divested in 2016—underscores our historical engagement in global IT services and the importance of tailoring our information management and technology capabilities to evolving business needs and customer requirements.

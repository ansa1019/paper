Procter & Gamble relies extensively on its information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems, networks and services—including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, physical security systems, hardware, software, and technical applications—many of which are managed or hosted by third parties to support core processes such as supplier ordering, material conversion, product shipping, marketing and sales, stakeholder data collection and processing, financial reporting, cash and banking management, collaborative global communications, regulatory compliance, data security and other operational functions. The company’s Global Business Services organization delivers standardized technology, processes and data tools to the Sector Business Units, Enterprise Markets and Corporate Functions to enhance business intelligence and consumer service at minimal cost. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats, malware, ransomware, phishing, social engineering and unauthorized access attempts, pose significant risks to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of P&G’s IT/OT databases and critical operations. The risk factors acknowledge that breaches or failures of information security systems or operational technology—whether due to malicious actors, hardware or network failures, power outages, natural disasters or inadequate business continuity plans—could interrupt ordering, production, distribution and payment processes, expose sensitive data, result in substantial remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action, and materially harm the company’s reputation, operations, financial results and cash flows. Periodic upgrades or adoption of new IT/OT technologies also carry the risk of implementation failures or increased vulnerability to cyber‐attacks, which may require significant investments to repair or replace systems and could impair operational efficiency and information integrity.

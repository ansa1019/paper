Netflix is scaling its streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in members and features by developing technology and leveraging third-party “cloud” computing services; the company utilizes its own communications and computer hardware systems in its facilities and those of third-party providers, alongside proprietary (“Open Connect”) and third-party content delivery networks, to efficiently stream high volumes of video and gaming content to members over the internet; it has architected its software and systems to run the vast majority of its computing on Amazon Web Services, recognizing that any disruption or interference with AWS would adversely impact its operations; the company employs a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to recommend and merchandise content, enable fast and efficient delivery to various consumer electronic devices, process payments and manage daily operations, and acknowledges that software “bugs” or other errors in development and deployment could impair its ability to operate its service, retain and add members; given its reliance on internet delivery, changes in network operator practices—such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps or discriminatory network management—could increase expenses and negatively affect membership acquisition and retention; the company has implemented systems and processes to prevent and detect cybersecurity threats, but any significant disruption or unauthorized access to its computer systems, or those of its third-party providers, could result in service degradation, unauthorized data disclosure or theft of intellectual property, adversely impacting its business, results of operations and reputation; technology and development costs include payroll and related expenses for personnel responsible for testing, maintaining and modifying the user interface, recommendations, merchandising and infrastructure, as well as general-use computer hardware and software, reflecting its ongoing investments in information systems capability and technology infrastructure to support its business strategy and internal processes.

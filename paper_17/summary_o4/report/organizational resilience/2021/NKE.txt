Nike’s filings note increasing complexity in implementing, operating and maintaining our information technology systems and controls—particularly those underpinning demand and supply planning and inventory control—and highlight the risks of interruptions in data and information technology systems, consumer data security breaches and evolving cybersecurity threats exacerbated by expanded remote work arrangements. We continue to make significant investments in digital technologies and information systems to support our Nike Direct operations, including retail digital platforms, mobile applications and social‐media channels, and depend on a global, integrated IT infrastructure that spans product design, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, distribution, financial reporting and regulatory compliance. Any failure, inadequacy or shutdown of these systems—whether due to security breaches, system malfunctions, vendor interruptions, insufficient maintenance or challenges in upgrading or integrating new technologies and standards—could delay product fulfillment, impair operational efficiency, require unplanned capital outlays, impede financial reporting and business continuity plans, damage our reputation and ultimately have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

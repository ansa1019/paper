The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize that the rapid expansion of e-commerce and digital commerce channels, the evolution of consumer shopping via mobile applications and online platforms, and the shift toward personalized, data-driven marketing have compelled the Coca-Cola system and its bottling partners to continuously strengthen digital ordering and retail capabilities, develop and implement digital transformation initiatives, and invest in advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and cloud-based services in order to sustain competitive positioning, connect with consumers, support innovation and enhance productivity across procurement, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and financial reporting. Digitizing the Coca-Cola system—whether by creating more relevant and personalized digital consumer experiences, equipping retail customers with powerful digital tools, or automating operations through integrated information systems—has been identified as a top strategic priority. The Company relies extensively on networks and information systems (including third-party hosted and cloud data storage services) to process financial information, manage supply-chain logistics, enable electronic communications, support compliance and research and development activities, and safeguard personal and confidential data, making it acutely vulnerable to system shutdowns, service disruptions, cybersecurity incidents, and privacy or data protection breaches. To address these risks, the Company maintains an information risk management program under IT management oversight, reports emerging threats and mitigation strategies to senior management and the Audit Committee, and carries cybersecurity insurance, yet acknowledges that evolving data localization and privacy regulations, escalating cyber-attack sophistication, and possible system failures or unauthorized disclosures could materially disrupt operations, delay financial reporting, erode customer and stakeholder confidence, invoke regulatory penalties or litigation, impair operational flexibility and organizational performance, and undermine the mobilization and leveraging of IT-based resources in support of its long-term strategic objectives.

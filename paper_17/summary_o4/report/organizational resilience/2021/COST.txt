The Company discloses that the availability and performance of its information technology systems are vital to its business and that failure to successfully execute IT projects or maintain system availability would adversely impact operations, since these systems process high volumes of transactions, conduct payment processing, track and value inventory and generate reports critical to procurement, manufacturing, logistics and sales decision-making.  It is undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects and has made substantial investments to build strong digital resiliency against power outages, hardware and telecommunications failures, viruses, security breaches, employee errors and catastrophic events, warning that any debilitating failure of critical IT systems, data centers or backup infrastructure would require significant resource commitments to restore services, could impair day-to-day operations, increase distribution costs and erode its competitive position.  The Company emphasizes its obligation to maintain the privacy, security and confidentiality of personal and business information in compliance with a multiplicity of global privacy and data protection regulations and its reliance on both internally managed and third-party networks and cloud providers, noting that increasingly sophisticated cyber threats—including coordinated attacks, advanced persistent threats and ransomware delivered via phishing—could exploit undetected vulnerabilities, resulting in reputational damage, litigation and regulatory enforcement actions, unauthorized disclosure or corruption of data, diminution of its IT investments, increased remediation costs, loss of member confidence and potentially inadequate insurance or indemnification coverage.  In addition, the Company continues to invest in its information systems and in the development and enhancement of its websites and mobile applications to support a relevant omnichannel experience, cautioning that an inability to deliver these member-facing technology enhancements in a timely and effective manner could adversely affect its competitive position, market responsiveness and financial results.

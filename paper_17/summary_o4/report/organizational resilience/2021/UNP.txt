The company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business, including technology systems operated by us or under the control of third parties or based on open-source software, and devotes significant capital and resources to acquire, develop, implement, maintain and upgrade these systems—such as positive train control (PTC) or the latest version of our transportation control systems—to protect against competitive disadvantages, improve operational efficiency and support service reliability; failure to deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner for new technology or system upgrades could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and liquidity. We are subject to cybersecurity risks despite devoting substantial resources to safeguard our systems and proprietary data, and there can be no assurance that our preventative measures will be sufficient to prevent or detect cyber-incidents or attacks, or avoid material impacts on our systems, or the systems of third parties, including unauthorized access to competitively sensitive, confidential or other critical data, service interruptions, safety failures, operational difficulties, financial losses, regulatory fines, or misuse or corruption of critical data. A successful security breach may remain undetected for an extended period and could cause a greater impact given our status as part of the critical U.S. infrastructure. In response, we continue to implement proprietary predictive technologies—such as a physics engine and software to evaluate train and route characteristics—and data-driven monitoring and control systems through our operating practices command center to identify causes of mainline service interruptions, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings, mitigate risk, educate employees on policies and procedures and prevent derailments, all of which underscore the mobilization and deployment of our IT-based resources in combination with other assets to enhance safety, efficiency and competitive strength.

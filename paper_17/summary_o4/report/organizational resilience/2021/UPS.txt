In its risk factors, the company emphasizes its reliance on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and internally-developed applications, to receive package-level information, track shipments, plan deliveries, execute billing and monitor financial and operational data across its franchise and subsidiary network, noting that these systems handle significant volumes of proprietary and confidential data moved across borders and are subject to evolving privacy, data-protection and data-localization laws such as the EU’s GDPR. It acknowledges that its own and third-party IT networks—including those of franchisees, acquired businesses and cloud service providers—are vulnerable to programming errors, power outages, cyber-attacks, human errors and other disruptions that may cause service outages, unauthorized access, data misuse or disclosure, operational interruptions, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reputational harm. The company discloses ongoing investments in IT security initiatives, risk management and disaster recovery plans, while cautioning that such measures may not fully prevent future data breaches or system disruptions. In its strategic discussion, the company describes an innovation-driven approach that leverages technology and automation to deliver sustainable network improvements and enhance the customer experience, highlights the October 2021 acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform focused on same-day delivery services, and reports capital expenditures in information technology projects as part of its broader investments to expand its technology-enabled capabilities.

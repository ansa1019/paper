Blackstone’s rapid pivot to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic underscored its reliance on robust technology infrastructure and cloud-based services to coordinate internal processes, support business continuity and facilitate secure communication and data processing; however, increased remote access and dependence on third-party platforms have heightened cybersecurity risks—ranging from phishing and social engineering to system outages—and amplified concerns around data confidentiality, integrity and regulatory compliance under evolving global privacy laws (such as GDPR and CCPA); these developments have intensified the firm’s focus on mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in concert with other organizational capabilities to safeguard its analytical, financial, accounting and communications systems, mitigate third-party vendor disruptions, strengthen disaster-recovery and business-continuity protocols, and ensure the timely, reliable and secure delivery of information critical to fund administration, client services and strategic decision-making.

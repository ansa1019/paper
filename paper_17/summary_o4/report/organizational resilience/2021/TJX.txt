Our business depends on robust information technology (“IT”) systems and related infrastructure to collect, process and distribute data and information for customers, associates, suppliers, service providers and other third parties and to support planning, purchasing, point-of-sale processing, e-commerce, supply chain and inventory management, human resources, financial management, communications, information security and legal and regulatory compliance; this reliance requires us to accurately anticipate our current and future IT needs and to successfully develop, implement and maintain appropriate systems, including effective disaster recovery plans. We recognize that risks to our global sourcing and logistics operations may include information technology challenges that could disrupt procurement, warehousing, transportation or other aspects of the value chain and increase costs. We may also be unable to effectively develop and implement strategies across rapidly evolving digital communication channels—such as digital/social media, email, mobile and e-commerce platforms—potentially impairing customer engagement and marketing effectiveness. Compromises of our data security, disruptions in our IT systems, or failures to meet the information technology needs of our business as we expand remote working arrangements for employees, service providers and third parties could result in material loss, liability, operational disruption or reputational harm. We maintain policies, procedures and controls to reduce the risks of security breaches, system failures or data compromises, but these measures cannot fully eliminate the threats posed by increasingly sophisticated malware, ransomware, phishing, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, as well as risks arising from power outages, system failures, catastrophic events or human error. Moreover, ongoing enhancements, modifications or replacements of our systems and infrastructure carry the risk of implementation challenges—such as failing to capture or maintain data accurately, efficiently test and deploy changes, realize expected benefits and manage potential operational disruptions or diversion of internal resources. In addition, the global regulatory environment governing information security and privacy is becoming more stringent, and any successful compromise or disruption of our IT systems could expose us to regulatory enforcement actions, litigation, contract liability or other material legal, financial and reputational consequences, including adverse effects on customer willingness to shop in our stores or online and on third-party service provider relationships.

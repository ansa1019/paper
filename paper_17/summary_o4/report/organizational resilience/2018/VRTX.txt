Vertex discloses that its ability to preserve or improve functioning under adversity is challenged by the multi-step international supply chain required for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug products, which depends on third-party contract manufacturers over which Vertex does not exercise control. Establishing and managing this global network requires significant financial commitment and contractual relationships, yet supply disruptions—whether due to raw-material shortages, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or other performance failures—could interrupt commercial supply of its marketed medicines or delay clinical trial timelines, with material effects on patients, operations and revenues. Vertex maintains a comprehensive business continuity plan intended to address crises, including catastrophic losses at its facilities, yet acknowledges that failure to fully implement these plans could result in delayed data recovery, inability to perform crucial corporate functions and major disruptions to its research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities. Its global operations also remain exposed to foreign-country risks such as varying intellectual property protections and geo-political business interruptions, and its reliance on information technology systems and third-party research organizations introduces the potential for system breaches or performance failures that could materially impair its ongoing programs, regulatory submissions and organizational effectiveness.

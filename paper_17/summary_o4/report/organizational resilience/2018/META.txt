The annual report describes a multifaceted approach to preserving performance under adverse conditions through substantial investments in infrastructure, processes, personnel and financial resources designed to absorb strain and ensure continuity of service.  The Company has “designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure” and continues to expand capacity—“we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power,” in order to meet evolving user demands and prevent “performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business.”  It maintains a broad mix of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, supplemented by a $2 billion revolving credit facility, which it “currently anticipate[s] … will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.”  The report identifies cyber-attacks, natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict and other catastrophic events as potential disruptors that “may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust … impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm,” and it discloses systems and processes “designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security breaches,” as well as ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review to mitigate emerging threats and remediate vulnerabilities—illustrated by its response to a September 2018 vulnerability that “exploited a vulnerability in Facebook’s code,” fixed the error, reset access tokens, and notified affected users.  The Company also describes its reliance on third-party providers and the corresponding vulnerability to “disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers,” and the risk of evolving regulatory requirements—such as the GDPR and data transfer frameworks—under which it has adapted its consent processes and controls to maintain access to critical data flows.  Together, these disclosures highlight a systemic perspective on safeguarding organizational health and sustaining core operations despite internal or external disturbances, through resource deployment, risk assessment, operational redundancy, crisis response and financial resilience.

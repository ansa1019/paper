The Annual Report describes an extensive risk management framework and contingency planning process that underpins our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions and preserve or improve functioning despite internal and external stress.  We take a comprehensive approach to risk management, embedding a defined risk framework with clear roles and responsibilities, an articulated risk appetite statement and approved limits for all major risk categories—strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational—so that risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled in a systematic, forward-looking manner.  Senior management and the Board approve strategic, capital and financial operating plans that are designed to align resources, capital and liquidity with our risk capacity, and we conduct capital scenario management and stress forecasting under both baseline and severely adverse economic scenarios to assess balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities.  We maintain contingency funding plans and recovery and resolution plans, including a “single point of entry” strategy, to ensure we can access liquidity, raise additional capital, de-risk portfolios through securitizations or asset sales, and continue to support our businesses under stress or resolution conditions.  Our business continuity and operational resilience capabilities include extensive business unit-level and enterprise testing of processes, systems and backup infrastructure, governance through three lines of defense, and crisis-management routines to assess operational risk exposures such as cyber-attacks or critical third-party failures, implement safeguards and remediate control gaps.  We employ value-at-risk and stress-testing methodologies, product-specific hedges and policies to manage market-making and trading exposures, and we use dynamic credit assessment systems, underwriting standards, portfolio monitoring and risk-rating frameworks to anticipate and mitigate credit losses.  Together, these measures reflect a multifaceted, systemic perspective on resilience, emphasizing adaptability, reconfiguration of resources, proactive foresight, and the ability to recover and emerge stronger from turbulent markets, regulatory shocks or extreme conditions.

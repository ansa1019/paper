In our Form 10-K we underscore the necessity of maintaining business continuity and operational flexibility by noting that “failure of our or others’ systems, networks, or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks,” and that “system failures and business disruptions” could cause us to lose customers, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage and trigger litigation or investigation, thereby requiring remediation efforts “to repair infrastructure and systems” and continuous evaluation of safeguards “to address the ever-evolving threat landscape.” We describe a phased deployment of a new billing system “in parallel” with our legacy platform to mitigate “unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays” and ensure operational continuity. Our recognition of $61 million in costs related to hurricanes, offset by insurance reimbursements, evidences our capacity to absorb strain, recover and preserve functioning under extreme conditions. We caution that “adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays,” highlighting the need for strategic resource allocation and agile responses to environmental perturbations. We also acknowledge that “the failure or inability” of critical suppliers “to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results,” reflecting the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and supply chain resilience. Service innovation and adaptation are embodied in our un-carrier strategy and the introduction of “Un-carrier Next,” which “radically changes the structure of our customer service department” by assigning a dedicated “team of experts” to each customer region, reflecting organizational reconfiguration to sustain performance and satisfaction under competitive pressures. Finally, in discussing our proposed merger, we identify integration challenges such as combining “operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems” while striving to “realize anticipated synergies,” underscoring our focus on reconstituting trajectories and adapting organizational practices in response to disruptive change.

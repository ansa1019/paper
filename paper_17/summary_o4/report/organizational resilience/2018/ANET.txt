Our annual report discloses that rapid growth and increased demand have placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure, requiring us to manage an increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale across hardware and software development, contract manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, fulfillment and support; to manage both domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and reporting processes and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems, and our failure to improve—or for our systems and processes to operate effectively—may result in disruption of current operations and end‐customer relationships, our inability to manage business growth, accurately forecast revenue, expenses and earnings, and prevent certain losses. We rely on estimated demand forecasts to determine component purchases and product manufacturing volumes, and our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that impede customer operations or excess inventory and related writedowns that harm our gross margins, while interruptions or delays in our supply chain, manufacturing or logistics functions could result in delayed order fulfillment, the loss of sales opportunities and operational disruption. Our dependence on third-party contract manufacturers and limited sources of key components exposes us to supply shortages, pricing fluctuations and quality-control risks that may require redesign or alternate sourcing in response to component discontinuations, trade restrictions or natural disasters, which in turn could delay product deliveries, damage customer relationships, reduce gross margins and impair our ability to maintain business continuity. Our business is further exposed to external pressures including environmental disruptions, natural disasters, trade tariffs, currency fluctuations, political and regulatory uncertainty such as Brexit and changes in U.S. tax and trade policy, any of which could restrict global supply or demand, depress economic activity or create delays in international transactions. We acknowledge that our ability to respond effectively to these risks depends on disaster recovery plans, risk-mitigation and adaptation strategies, including improved forecasting, enhanced supply chain management, diversification of suppliers and integrated resilience controls, which are essential to preserving or improving our functioning under challenging conditions, sustaining firm performance and supporting long-term growth.

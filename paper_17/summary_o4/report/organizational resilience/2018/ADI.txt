In its discussion of risk factors and operational strategy, the Form 10-K recognizes that “disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations” by causing customers to cancel, decrease or postpone orders and impeding accurate forecasting and planning, and that “financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges.” The Company further warns that “a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems … could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation” and describes reliance on diversified third-party suppliers and on internal manufacturing operations across multiple geographies to mitigate such risks. To align reported results with actual end-user demand, the Company continues to defer “revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers,” recognizing that “our future revenue … are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.” In response to changing conditions and to improve operational effectiveness and efficiency, the Company has undertaken “restructuring actions … to reduce overall operating costs,” including consolidation of wafer and test facility operations acquired through business combinations, with expected annual savings of approximately $60 million. The Company maintains robust liquidity, holding $816.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $1 billion that may be drawn to finance operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other corporate purposes for at least the next twelve months. Recognizing that “a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership,” the Company plans to sustain significant R&D investments, and it subjects its finite-lived and indefinite-lived assets to regular impairment reviews—applying qualitative and quantitative tests—to ensure that carrying values do not exceed recoverable amounts. These combined risk management and strategic resource-allocation practices reflect the Company’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure operations and preserve or improve performance under internal or external variations and disturbances.

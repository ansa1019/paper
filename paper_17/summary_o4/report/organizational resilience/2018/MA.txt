The Company notes its reliance on a business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies to manage disruptions caused by technology malfunctions, power outages, telecommunications interruptions, terrorism or other catastrophic events; it maintains risk management policies and procedures, including collateral requirements and participant default procedures, to support clearing and settlement activities and address credit and liquidity risks arising from guarantor obligations in the event of customer failures. The disclosures further describe the need to adapt to regulatory and legislative pressures across multiple jurisdictions—such as expanded oversight of payment systems, requirements for third-party access to payment accounts and data localization rules—which may require prior approvals, system customizations, increased compliance burdens and accelerated product-innovation efforts in order to preserve operational flexibility, network integrity and competitive differentiation. The Company recognizes the importance of protecting the integrity and performance of its systems under adverse conditions, noting that prolonged service outages or security breaches, as well as information security incidents, could disrupt operations, damage reputation, increase costs and expose the firm to liability; accordingly, it continues to invest in controls, processes and protective measures to address evolving cyber-threats, monitor and revise data practices in light of complex privacy and security regulations, and mitigate risks associated with fraud, third-party processors and technological change. Management also acknowledges the challenges posed by disintermediation, intense pricing pressure, rapid technological developments and merchant consolidation, which may require dynamic resource allocation, cost containment initiatives, strategic incentives and innovation in payment solutions to maintain volumes, recover from disruptions and preserve firm performance and future growth.

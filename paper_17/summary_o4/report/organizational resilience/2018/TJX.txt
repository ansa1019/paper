The company’s risk disclosures emphasize that “failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our results,” noting that opportunistic buying, lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns require merchants to “effectively react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market” and secure “the right merchandise at the right times, in the right quantities, at the right prices and in the right mix.” It further asserts that “to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns, we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores, maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store, and be flexible in our allocation of floor space,” and acknowledges that although “our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences,” failure to do so could harm performance. The filing warns that our large size and scale, multiple banners and locations and autonomy among banners “increases the risk that our systems, controls, practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently” and that “if business information is not shared effectively, or if we are otherwise unable to manage our size or growth effectively, our business may be adversely affected or we may need to reduce the rate of expansion or otherwise curtail growth.” It highlights the criticality of information technology and cybersecurity, noting that “our ongoing operations and successful growth are dependent on accurately anticipating our current and future information technology needs and successfully developing and implementing appropriate systems that can provide the right support at the right time,” and cautions that “any successful compromise or disruption of our information technology systems could result in material business disruption, liability and reputational damage.” The company addresses continuity planning for “natural or other disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other extreme weather; climate conditions; unforeseen public health issues, such as pandemics and epidemics; or fires, explosions and acts of war or terrorism,” which “could disrupt our operations in a number of ways, including severely damaging or destroying one or more of our stores, distribution facilities or data centers,” and notes that it has “implemented strategies for mitigating potential disruptions to our supply chain,” including Brexit contingency plans to “realign our European division’s supply chain” and establish supporting resources and systems. The disclosures also describe the use of hedging strategies—“derivative instruments designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs” and “inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates”—while acknowledging that “any such strategy may not be effective or sufficient.” Finally, the company underscores its reliance on forecasting and cost-control processes that “seek to plan sales and align expenses,” warning that “if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results, our financial performance could be adversely affected,” thereby underscoring the organization’s need to absorb strain, adapt its resource deployment and preserve functionality under challenging conditions.

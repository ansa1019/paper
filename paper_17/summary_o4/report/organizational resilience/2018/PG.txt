In its Form 10-K, Procter & Gamble discloses that its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning is challenged by disruptions in its global supply chain—including labor disputes, impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, extreme weather events, acts of war or terrorism—and that the loss of such arrangements, if not effectively managed and remedied, could interrupt product supply and adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. The company describes its information and operational technology (“IT/OT”) risk management program as a cross-functional system of analyses, plans and strategies that is regularly reviewed by senior management, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors to address emerging cybersecurity threats and ensure that business continuity plans effectively respond to potential failures of key IT/OT systems or service providers, warning that inadequately addressed technology incidents could expose P&G to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and legal harm. To mitigate external pressures such as foreign currency fluctuations, political volatility, labor market disruptions, economic downturns or changes in fiscal and trade policies, P&G employs currency hedging, extended supplier payment terms, productivity improvements in cost of goods sold and SG&A, and maintains robust liquidity through strong operating cash flow, undrawn credit facilities and high-quality debt ratings to sustain access to capital under stress. The company further outlines ongoing organizational change processes—including a multi-year productivity and cost savings plan focused on supply chain optimization, outsourcing, overhead and workforce streamlining, together with continual investment in product, packaging and sales innovation and clear leadership succession planning—to preserve operational flexibility, resourcefulness and continuity in the face of unpredictable conditions, reflecting a systemic approach to maintaining integrity and performance under challenging circumstances.

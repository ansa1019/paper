Microsoft recognizes in its risk factors that its operations and financial results are subject to various internal and external pressures – ranging from intense competition, rapidly evolving and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, cyberattacks, regulatory changes, data privacy challenges, and catastrophic weather or seismic events – that could adversely affect its business continuity, financial condition, and operating results. The company is undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation, devoting significant resources to research and development, cloud engineering, and infrastructure expansion to ensure operational flexibility and continuity of services, and hedging foreign currency exposure to mitigate volatility. It continuously engineers more secure products and services, develops mitigation technologies and maintains digital security infrastructure to defend against constantly evolving cyberthreats and vulnerabilities, and implements business continuity management plans to preserve service delivery under extreme conditions. Microsoft also leverages volume licensing programs with software assurance to provide predictable multi-year support, enforces talent retention and succession planning to safeguard organizational knowledge and adaptability, and evaluates acquisitions, joint ventures, supply-chain arrangements, and financial hedges – all to allocate and reconfigure resources and capabilities in response to disruptions and risks.

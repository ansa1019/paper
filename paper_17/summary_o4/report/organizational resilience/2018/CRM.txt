The Company recognizes that security breaches, system defects or third-party failures—whether through unauthorized access, employee error or infrastructure vulnerabilities—could materially disrupt its services, harm its reputation, expose it to legal and financial liabilities and impair customer trust, and therefore has adopted a layered approach to risk mitigation that includes maintaining and improving business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, regular escalation and response protocols, and periodic briefings of the board of directors, audit committee and executive management on cyber-security events and ongoing efforts to improve security. It also employs a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, such as near-real-time replication of production environments in separate facilities and alternate hosting arrangements, while acknowledging that natural disasters, acts of terrorism, local administrative actions or other unanticipated events could nevertheless cause lengthy service interruptions. To preserve operational continuity and performance under pressure, the Company continually plans for and invests in additional data-center capacity, infrastructure upgrades, development and test environments, capacity-planning processes and the reallocation of resources—sometimes from development activities to remediation—to mitigate any system degradation, and it integrates acquired technologies into its single, multi-tenant application platform to avoid fragmentation and maintain scalability. Further, it seeks to adapt to evolving internal and external pressures by expanding research and development, attracting and retaining key personnel, providing professional services to facilitate customer adoption, and pursuing strategic initiatives such as cross-selling, partner ecosystem growth, international expansion and platform enhancements, all of which collectively support its ability to anticipate, respond to and recover from disruptive events and preserve service availability and performance even under challenging conditions.

Prologis discloses that despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for its internal and hosted information technology systems, its operations remain vulnerable to damages from energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, and that any system failure or accident causing interruptions in operations could result in a material disruption to its business and require additional costs to remedy damages, potentially harming its reputation and stakeholder confidence. The Company maintains earthquake, hurricane and flood hazard insurance on properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity or storm and flood risk, evaluates its coverage annually through analyses by outside consultants and, where commercially reasonable, self-insures, and it conducts ongoing assessments of regulatory, tax and compliance exposures under multiple jurisdictions to mitigate legal and operational risks. To address financial and market volatility, Prologis diversifies its investments geographically and by sector, borrows predominantly in the functional currencies of its investments to establish a natural hedge, enters into derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges to offset translation adjustments, and continually reviews the design and effectiveness of its disclosure controls, procedures and internal control over financial reporting to prevent errors and misstatements. Recognizing its dependence on deep industry knowledge and key personnel, the Company allocates resources to attract, retain and develop talent, and through co-investment ventures it shares capital commitments, maintains sufficient influence to achieve its business objectives, and realizes promotes to fuel strategic initiatives. It funds development completions, capital expenditures and acquisitions with operating cash flows, contributions and dispositions of non-strategic assets, and issues senior notes and credit facility borrowings to extend debt maturities and lower its effective interest rate, thereby preserving its integrity and performance under adverse conditions and positioning itself to absorb strain, maintain business continuity and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

Accenture’s annual report emphasizes the importance of maintaining operations under adverse conditions through its “business continuity and disaster recovery plans,” although it acknowledges that catastrophic events could interrupt communications with clients and disrupt critical processes, materially affecting results of operations and reputation. It identifies “international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions” as significant risks to people, facilities and service delivery, warns that “extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services…or cyberattacks” could compromise its ability to serve clients, and notes that it “generally does not have insurance for losses and interruptions” caused by such events. The report underscores the need to “adapt to ongoing changes in technology and offerings,” stating that success depends on its ability to “anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes” and warning that failure to “invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments” could undermine its competitive advantage. In managing its workforce, Accenture explains that “we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand,” including evaluating attrition, “adjusting levels of new hiring” and, if necessary, using involuntary terminations to “keep our supply of skills and resources in balance.” It also describes efforts to “adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases” on gross margin. To address financial variability, the Company details how “changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items,” notes that its “currency hedging programs…might not be successful,” and affirms that it “continuously monitor[s] these costs and implement[s] cost-management actions, as appropriate.” Acknowledging its reliance on a “global delivery capability,” Accenture warns that concentration of delivery centers in specific locations “presents a number of operational risks” beyond its control and that disruptive events “could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services.” Finally, the report outlines its dynamic revenue-recognition approach—using the percentage-of-completion method, “continuously monitoring” estimated revenues and costs and recording loss provisions when a loss becomes probable—and concludes that it believes “our current and longer-term working capital, investments and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisfied…through cash flows from operations and…our borrowing facilities.”

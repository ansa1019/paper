The Company cautions that its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity is challenged by internal or external variations and disturbances—such as market volatility, raw-material shortages, equipment failures, power outages, environmental events, tariffs, trade restrictions, and single-source dependencies—that may disrupt production, increase manufacturing costs, and harm customer relationships. To maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, it continuously implements new product and process technologies across geographically dispersed facilities, manages inventory through lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value analyses, and anticipates customer needs via advanced product qualification to secure design wins and avoid excess inventory. Liquidity and business continuity are supported by cash-flow forecasting, an undrawn $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, debt and equity financing programs, share repurchase authorizations, and accelerated share repurchase agreements. Strategic partnerships and joint ventures enable shared R&D and cost-sharing to de-risk technology transitions, while systems of controls over physical security, intellectual property, supply‐chain performance, and counterparty exposures reinforce resilience against security breaches, trade disputes, and counterpart defaults. Human capital initiatives to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees amid competitive labor markets and changing immigration policies further underpin organizational flexibility and adaptability. Governance and risk-management frameworks—encompassing contractual obligations, legal proceedings, environmental, health and safety regulations, and regulatory compliance—are designed to protect system integrity, operational flexibility, and financial condition under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

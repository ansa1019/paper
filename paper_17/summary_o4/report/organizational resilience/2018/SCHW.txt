Charles Schwab has established a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework, approved by its board of directors and overseen by a global risk committee and functional sub-committees, that defines risk appetite and assigns responsibility for risk identification, measurement, monitoring, reporting, and mitigation across operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks.  To minimize business interruptions and ensure continuity, the firm “maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.”  An information security program “knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data,” with continuous monitoring, collaborative threat-sharing with government agencies and industry partners, employee training, and fraud prevention measures to address “unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data.”  Schwab’s policies for credit risk include collateral arrangements, underwriting guidelines with maximum loan-to-value ratios and minimum credit scores, ongoing reviews of delinquencies and nonaccrual loans, and adjustments to margin and lending requirements to preserve balance-sheet integrity under market fluctuations.  To support operational and financial resilience, the company “has established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions,” maintains internal and external funding sources including a diversified investment portfolio and committed credit lines, and conducts “regular liquidity stress testing” and “regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events.”  Early-warning indicators and contingency funding and capital plans are reviewed periodically, and “any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to [the parent] in the form of dividends and returns of capital,” with subordinated loans and equity investments available to meet subsidiary needs—all designed to preserve functioning, absorb strain, and adapt under challenging conditions in alignment with the maintenance of positive adjustment under adversity.

Visa’s compliance programs and policies are designed to support our adherence to a wide array of evolving regulations and are continually enhanced as regulations change, yet the introduction of widely varying regulations worldwide may limit our ability to rapidly adjust product offerings, services, fees, and other aspects of our operations, exposing constraints on our operational flexibility. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures, including collateral requirements, and indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement failures, thereby managing liquidity risk and ensuring continuity of transaction processing under adverse conditions. As innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, we have adapted local rules and practices, customized payment capabilities, and entered into strategic arrangements to remain competitive, reflecting dynamic capabilities aimed at sustaining performance in turbulent and uncertain markets. Our business continuity program, cybersecurity and supplier risk management initiatives, and oversight of processing infrastructure, governance, and capital requirements imposed by central banks are critical to our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and recover from operational disruptions, errors, and cyber-attacks. Liquidity management—including maintaining cash and investment reserves, a commercial paper program, a revolving credit facility, and structured dividend and share-repurchase policies—supports our financial resilience through economic, political, market, and social perturbations. Management’s ongoing assessments of legal exposures, indemnification obligations under our retrospective responsibility plans, tax uncertainties, and client incentive arrangements, together with targeted investments in technology and infrastructure, are designed to preserve organizational integrity and performance, enabling us to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

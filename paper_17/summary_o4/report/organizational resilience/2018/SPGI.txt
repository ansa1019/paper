S&P Global’s annual report emphasizes the company’s efforts to prepare for and respond to a wide range of internal and external pressures, noting that “should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations,” and that while “we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession,” such events “could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.” The company also underscores its risk-mitigation and adaptability measures in the face of cyber threats, stating that “we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers,” yet acknowledging “there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security” against evolving cyber-attack techniques. Dependency on third parties is likewise addressed, with the report warning that “outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements” and could “result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm,” while reliance on electronic delivery “may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or increased government regulation.” In describing its strategic priorities, S&P Global highlights initiatives to “transform technology infrastructure to support growth, improve cost efficiency and mitigate cyber risk,” to “adopt core management systems, tools and processes to improve prioritization and agility,” and to “develop an enterprise-wide data strategy and execution plan, leveraging machine learning and data science,” reflecting an organizational focus on resilience through proactive resource allocation, system integrity, and adaptability under challenging conditions.

Nextera Energy and its subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company operate within a complex regulatory framework that subjects their generation, transmission and distribution facilities, along with natural gas infrastructure, to extensive federal, state and local cost-based rate regulation, requiring them to plan and manage operations so as to recover significant costs, earn a regulated return through base rates, fuel and other cost recovery clauses and reserve amortization under rate agreements and to address any inability or failure to recover costs, which could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, FPL elected to use available reserve amortization to offset storm restoration costs and plans to replenish those reserves through tax savings over the term of its rate agreement, while both companies maintain storm reserves, restricted funds and decommissioning funds—invested in fixed income and equity securities—to fund service restoration and nuclear plant decommissioning, periodically updating cost studies and regulatory liabilities to preserve system integrity under extreme conditions. To mitigate commodity price volatility and maintain business continuity, FPL’s risk management fuel procurement program, subject to annual prudence review, and NextEra Energy’s energy marketing and trading activities employ derivative instruments—including non-qualifying hedges—for power, fuel, interest rate and foreign currency risks, valued at estimated fair value, monitored with value-at-risk analytics and managed under master netting agreements, letters of credit, cash collateral and guarantees. Both companies secure liquidity and support capital expenditures, working capital and debt service through revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, debt and equity issuances, differential membership interests in renewable projects and project-specific financing arrangements, while monitoring credit rating triggers that could require collateral postings or affect borrowing costs. Their operating risk management and continuity planning encompass a wide range of potential disruptions—from equipment start-up uncertainties, supply chain interruptions and facility outages to severe weather, natural disasters, terrorism and cyber attacks—addressed through ongoing investments in plant reliability and modernization, insurance programs, adherence to mandatory reliability standards, emergency management planning and contractual commitments to perform asset retirement and decommissioning activities. Furthermore, defined benefit pension plan funding and nuclear decommissioning obligations are measured and accreted based on actuarial assumptions, discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets, with unrecognized gains and losses deferred and amortized, reflecting a multifaceted approach to absorb strain, adapt to internal and external perturbations, reconfigure operational and financial trajectories and preserve functioning under challenging conditions.

Our filings describe a multitude of strategies, investments and risk‐mitigation practices that support our ability to maintain continuity and adapt under pressure.  We have continued to invest in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and in customer premise equipment such as the X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways to meet changing consumer behaviors and technological disruptions, and we regularly assess and expand our line extensions and business services to reconfigure our offerings and preserve functionality in rapidly changing market and competitive environments.  To guard against internal and external disturbances—from cyber attacks, network failures or natural disasters such as hurricanes and wild fires—we have developed and maintain extensive security programs, systems‐based defenses and incident‐response processes, recognizing that network and information systems are critical to operations, that threats constantly evolve and that recovery efforts may require significant capital and other resources.  We leverage risk assessment and business continuity planning in our technology initiatives, including DOCSIS 3.1 and FDX deployments, sky Q set-top boxes and cloud DVR, and we actively manage regulatory, intellectual property and vendor supply-chain risks to ensure resource allocation and operational flexibility.  Our risk management framework addresses potential cascading impacts—from process breakdowns, infectious disease outbreaks or terrorist attacks to power outages and cyber‐security breaches—and contemplates large expenditures to repair or replace damaged properties and systems, insurance limitations and expanded crisis response measures.  We adapt our video service offerings through platform innovation, content licensing strategies and customized programming packages to respond to market fragmentation, shifts in consumer behavior driven by OTT streaming platforms and intensified competitive pressures.  We also pursue strategic acquisitions, inter-organizational collaborations and operational resource realignments to strengthen our competitive position, reconstitute trajectories after disruptive events such as the 2018 Sky acquisition and recalibrate our capital structure and dividend policy to preserve financial resilience in extreme and nominal conditions alike.

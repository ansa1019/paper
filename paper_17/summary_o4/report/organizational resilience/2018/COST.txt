The company’s disclosures emphasize its resilience capabilities by describing its reliance on the “orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process” and on primary and back‐up information technology systems that must “maintain uninterrupted operation” despite “power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees,” and by noting that “any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.” To preserve functioning under such disturbances, it reports ongoing “investments to improve or advance critical information systems and processing capabilities,” a change‐management process to “mitigate” disruption risks, and remedial measures to address an identified “material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls,” with plans to complete remediation by fiscal 2019. It also stresses business‐continuity planning through self‐insurance and reinsurance programs that “estimate liabilities using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions,” maintenance of bank credit facilities, letters of credit and commercial paper programs for working capital and general corporate purposes, and diversified vendor relationships to absorb strain from labor disputes, supply constraints or natural disasters that “may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise.” Cybersecurity and privacy protections—“security measures and controls to protect personal and business information”—are described alongside the risk that “unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems,” prompting further resource commitments to safeguard data. The company outlines strategic agility in adapting to economic and competitive pressures through “adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items, and through our online offerings,” foreign‐exchange hedging to offset “fluctuations in currency exchange rates,” and expansion of its warehouse base and e‐commerce capabilities, while acknowledging that “targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.” Finally, it recognizes environmental and regulatory challenges—“natural disasters or other catastrophes,” “public health issues,” “climate change and extreme weather conditions,” and “changes in privacy and information‐security laws and regulations”—that could increase costs, disrupt operations or require suspension of locations, underscoring its focus on preserving integrity and performance under adverse, nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

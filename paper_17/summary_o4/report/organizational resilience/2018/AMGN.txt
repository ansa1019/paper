Our risk factor disclosures describe a broad range of external pressures and internal responses that together illustrate our organizational resilience in practice. We acknowledge that our business faces challenging conditions ranging from economic and geopolitical disruptions, government and commercial payer reforms, evolving reimbursement and pricing policies, competitive threats from biosimilars and generics, to the complexity of global regulatory requirements and intellectual property litigation. To preserve positive adjustment under these pressures, we maintain forward‐looking risk assessments, accrue for rebates, chargebacks and returns, and deploy transformation and process‐improvement initiatives to reconfigure our resources toward product launches, pipeline advancement and next‐generation manufacturing. We plan for business continuity through diversified manufacturing sites and single‐source contingencies, backup power generation following events like Hurricane Maria, alternative supplier arrangements and disaster recovery protocols, all supported by rigorous compliance and quality systems. We continually monitor adverse event signals, adjust clinical and regulatory strategies in response to new data requirements or accelerated approval conditions, and adapt our development plans when safety, efficacy or market dynamics change. Our financial resilience is reinforced by proactive capital allocation, hedging strategies against currency and interest rate volatility, investment portfolio management and access to credit facilities, while our global expansion efforts involve navigating varying legal, tax and market environments. In aggregate, these disclosures reflect an integrated approach—spanning risk mitigation, strategic adaptation, operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and stakeholder collaboration—to absorb strain and maintain or improve our functioning despite internal or external disturbances.

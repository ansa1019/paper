The annual report describes a comprehensive risk management framework designed to preserve the company’s integrity and performance under challenging conditions through oversight by board committees, a cross-functional corporate risk committee, and division and country risk groups, supported by a dedicated risk management office and internal audit. It highlights strategies to mitigate internal and external pressures, including the implementation of shared business services and enterprise-wide information systems, global purchasing programs, productivity initiatives to simplify, harmonize and automate processes, and go-to-market and supply chain re-engineering to optimize resource allocation and operational flexibility. The company uses derivatives to hedge commodity, foreign-exchange and interest-rate risks and maintains non-speculative hedging programs, while continuously monitoring and stress-testing liquidity, capital and operating scenarios. It identifies potential disruptions—natural disasters, cyberattacks, political volatility, regulatory changes, pandemics, terrorism and supply chain interruptions—that could impair the ability to make, manufacture, distribute or sell products, and emphasizes investments in network security, backup and disaster recovery, alternative sourcing and employee training to enhance crisis preparedness and business continuity. Environmental perturbations and resource constraints are addressed through sustainable packaging development, water conservation measures and capital commitments to improve recyclability, demonstrating a future-oriented, systemic perspective. By integrating contingency planning, strategic foresight, adaptive productivity programs and the deployment of financial and human capital, the company aims to absorb strain, maintain partial performance and emerge stronger from disruptive events, reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment and continuity of operations under adversity.

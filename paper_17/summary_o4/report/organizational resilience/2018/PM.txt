We maintain backup systems and business continuity plans and take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access, recognizing that failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration by outside parties to extract or corrupt information or otherwise disrupt business processes, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in loss of revenue, assets or confidential data, litigation and regulatory action, damage to our reputation and brands, and significant remediation costs. Because we operate in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters, pandemics or conflicts, any of which could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing or distribution capabilities, lead to loss of critical property or equipment, and cause difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, thereby reducing volumes, revenues and net earnings. We may also be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources, which could materially increase our costs. To navigate these challenges and sustain performance under pressure, we have made transforming our culture and ways of working a strategic priority, aligning talent with business needs, innovating and evolving toward a consumer-centric business, and focusing on the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products that adult smokers find acceptable alternatives, supported by rigorous scientific substantiation of exposure reduction and advocacy for science-based regulatory frameworks and transparent communication so that we can absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger from regulatory, market and operational disruptions.

The Company has established a comprehensive risk management process, administered by its Chief Financial Officer, that employs periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify, evaluate and develop risk mitigation controls and procedures for operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect its business, with the objective of maintaining business continuity and preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  It expressly recognizes the critical need to adapt its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment by identifying and responding to economic, social, style and technological trends and changing customer expectations in an omni-channel experience, and by executing large, complex programs that require more integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing, underpinned by employees and contractors who must adapt and learn new competencies and capabilities to deliver a consistent customer experience across in-store and digital channels.  The Company invests continuously in information security and disaster recovery planning for its customer-facing technology systems, which are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, power outages, viruses, system failures or catastrophic events, and acknowledges that unauthorized access, loss or unavailability of data can interrupt operations, erode customer confidence and demand substantial remediation and financial resources.  It also maintains strategic supplier and third-party service provider relationships to support its supply chain transformation, seeking to enhance fulfillment and delivery capabilities and mitigate risks from vendor failures, trade policy changes, natural disasters, pandemics and capacity constraints, while managing regulatory compliance in domestic and international markets to preserve operational flexibility and system integrity.  Through periodic comprehensive reassessments of the business, the Company has aligned its leadership team, exited non-core activities, closed under-performing stores, rationalized inventory to remove clutter, redirected investment toward top-selling items in job-lot quantities for professional customers, and pursued strategic transactions and portfolio realignment to reconfigure resources, strengthen organizational capabilities and drive operational efficiency.  By focusing on four key areas—driving merchandising excellence, transforming the supply chain, delivering operational efficiency and intensifying customer engagement—the Company seeks to preserve and improve its functioning and competitive advantage under internal and external variations and disturbances, ensuring resilience, adaptability and sustained performance.

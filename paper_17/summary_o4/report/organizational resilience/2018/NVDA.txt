NVIDIA discloses that its worldwide operations and supply chain are subject to disruptions from natural or man-made disasters—including earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, extreme weather, pandemics, cyber-attacks, power or water shortages and other catastrophic events—which could require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations and could harm its business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation; it notes that critical activities, from research and development in California to semiconductor wafer fabrication, assembly and packaging in Asia, are concentrated in geographically vulnerable areas and that a major earthquake, geopolitical change, trade policy shifts or disruption at third-party systems could lead to declines in revenue, increases in expenses and prolonged recovery. The company acknowledges its dependence on industry-leading foundries and subcontractors, exposing it to risks such as lack of guaranteed wafer supply, capacity constraints, process technology transitions, low manufacturing yields and the potential prioritization of competitor orders, any of which may impair its ability to meet customer demand, require resource reallocation and jeopardize business continuity. NVIDIA further recognizes that rapidly evolving cyber threats and data security breaches necessitate continuous engineering of more secure products and enhancement of internal controls, as interruptions, delays or cessation of service could disrupt order fulfillment, interrupt critical functions, increase expenses and damage its reputation. Its success in maintaining performance under environmental perturbations and market volatility depends on identifying emerging industry changes, adapting strategy in a timely manner, allocating technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing resources, and building scalable infrastructure for customer service and support; failure to anticipate evolving customer requirements or technological trends, or to develop and enhance products through sustained research and development investments, could lead to excess or obsolete inventory, product obsolescence, significant inventory write-downs, warranty and recall costs, diversion of engineering personnel, impairment of assets and reduced operational flexibility. NVIDIA’s liquidity and financial resilience are supported by cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $7.42 billion as of January 27, 2019, a $575 million revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program and notes issued in 2016 and 2017, as well as a plan to return $3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends—all designed to preserve resource availability under stress. The company also highlights that its international operations are exposed to changing regulatory requirements, tariffs, import duties and trade barriers, and that its ability to attract, retain and transition key executives and employees is critical to sustaining organizational capabilities, succession planning and strategic execution. Finally, NVIDIA recognizes that legal, regulatory, tax and intellectual property contingencies require recognition of potential liabilities and the allocation of reserves, as adverse rulings or regulatory actions could necessitate further resource reconfiguration, impacting its ability to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.

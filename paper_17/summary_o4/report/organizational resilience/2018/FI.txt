The Company acknowledges that its continued ability to maintain or improve operational performance under challenging conditions requires ongoing adaptation of its products and services to evolving technology and market requirements, active management of competitive pressures and client contract renewals, and disciplined allocation of resources toward innovation, security, and infrastructure. It recognizes that unauthorized access, cyberattacks or other security incidents could disrupt the integrity, continuity and trust of its systems and data, necessitating substantial additional investment in information security controls and business continuity planning. The reliability of its processing systems is critical, as operational failures—whether due to hardware or software defects, human error, natural disasters, telecommunications outages or other external events—can interrupt service delivery, damage client relationships and result in significant remediation costs. The Company also faces the risk that software development delays, defects or integration difficulties could impair system functionality, delay market acceptance and require resource‐intensive remediation. In an environment of regulatory complexity and consolidation among financial institutions, the firm must respond to heightened oversight, compliance obligations and shifting client capacities, as well as manage the integration of acquisitions without disrupting existing operations or overextending its financial and human capital. Moreover, the Company’s resilience depends on retaining and motivating experienced management and technical personnel, protecting its proprietary technology, preserving flexibility in its debt and financing arrangements, and balancing strategic initiatives—such as active portfolio management, disciplined capital deployment and targeted investments in digital and payment solutions—to ensure that it can absorb strain and preserve or enhance functioning in the face of adversity, external disturbances and unforeseen challenges.

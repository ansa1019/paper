The company’s disclosures reflect an awareness that preserving operational integrity under adverse conditions requires systematic risk assessment and mitigation, redundancy and contingency planning, and the flexibility to reconfigure resources in response to disruptions. The company depends on single‐sourced and limited‐source suppliers, outsourcing partners, carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers for critical components, manufacturing, logistics and distribution, and acknowledges that any failure of these partners to perform, or any interruption caused by natural or man-made disasters, political events, international trade disputes, terrorism, industrial accidents, information technology system failures or public health crises, could impede its ability to manufacture, deliver and support products, delay customer transactions, slow service offerings and materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and operating results. It orders components and builds inventory based on forecasts covering periods up to 150 days and commits to manufacturing purchase obligations, recognizing that forecast errors may result in excess or insufficient inventory, write-downs, cancellation fees and impaired recoverability of manufacturing equipment or prepayments. The company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, corporate facilities, information systems, retail infrastructure, derivative hedges for currency and interest rate exposures, insurance coverage for warranty and data security risks, and policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws, yet it concedes these measures may be inadequate under extreme or exceptional conditions. It maintains system redundancy and business continuity and disaster recovery planning, periodically reviews the valuation of marketable securities, inventory, manufacturing-related assets and lease obligations, and accrues for estimated warranty costs, purchase commitment cancellation fees, indemnification obligations and deferred tax liabilities, while noting that macroeconomic volatility, rapid technological change, competitive intensity and unforeseen events may require the organization to adapt its resource deployment, reconstitute operational trajectories and reconfigure strategic initiatives to sustain or improve performance in the face of adversity.

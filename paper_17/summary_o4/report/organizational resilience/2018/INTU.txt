Intuitâ€™s disclosures describe organizational resilience as its capacity to maintain performance and positive adjustment under challenging conditions by proactively investing significant resources and management attention in adapting to technological change, updating its internal information technology systems, network and data center infrastructure, and expanding high-availability capabilities to ensure operational continuity and business continuity. Future revenue growth depends upon its ability to adapt to technological change and global trends in customer access to software offerings, to innovate and develop new products, services and business models, and to develop its skills, tools and capabilities to meet changing customer needs, attract and retain talent, and sustain competitive advantage. Intuit mitigates risks through ongoing enhancements to its systems, implementation of security technologies and business controls to limit unauthorized access and cyberattacks, collaboration with industry and government partners to protect against fraud, and maintenance of disaster recovery and insurance plans for events ranging from natural disasters and seismic faults to system failures; however, it acknowledges that such measures cannot provide absolute security or fully compensate for all losses. The company also recognizes the importance of strategic resource allocation, integration of acquired technologies and businesses, and the development, management and maintenance of critical third-party relationships to avoid disruptions, ensure adequate service levels during peak periods, prevent interruptions in service, manage supply-chain and distribution risks, and protect its reputation and brand equity, while noting that failure to successfully implement system enhancements, integrate acquisitions, respond to regulatory changes or manage partner performance could result in temporary or sustained unavailability of products and services, unexpected refunds, lost revenues, increased expenses, damage to its reputation and financial condition, and ultimately impede its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity.

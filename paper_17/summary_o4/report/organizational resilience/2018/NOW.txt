ServiceNow discloses that its global operations and revenue are subject to sudden macroeconomic shifts—including geopolitical instability, trade disputes, high levels of credit defaults, and currency fluctuations—that can disrupt customers’ IT spending, delay purchases and renewals, and thereby harm operating results. It acknowledges that despite crisis management and disaster response plans, natural disasters, flooding, fires, power outages, pandemics, terrorism, political unrest, vandalism and other catastrophic events may interrupt data centers and R&D sites—many located near major seismic faults—resulting in data loss, lengthy recovery times and impaired service continuity. The company further warns that cyber-security events—stemming from employee error, deliberate attacks, malware or third-party breaches—could compromise sensitive data, disrupt service availability and trigger remediation, litigation, indemnification and reputational costs, and therefore it devotes significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures while recognizing that evolving threats may necessitate further investment to preserve system integrity and business continuity. To mitigate foreign exchange risk, ServiceNow has entered into short-term hedging contracts to partially offset currency volatility, although these cannot entirely eliminate adverse impacts. The firm emphasizes the need to accurately predict and respond to rapidly evolving technological and market developments—identifying and innovating in emerging technologies, aligning resource allocation, integrating partner-delivered professional services and expanding service offerings into IT operations management, customer service management, security operations management and HR service delivery—to maintain competitive advantage, operational flexibility and performance under pressure, and cautions that failure to adapt to changing customer requirements, regulatory regimes or unforeseen disruptions could undermine its resilience and long-term sustainability.

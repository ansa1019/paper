Goldman Sachs has instituted a comprehensive business continuity plan and resiliency plans that maintain a “contingency funding plan” to anticipate cash and collateral needs during severe market stress by prefunding global core liquid assets, implement dynamic balance sheet planning and asset-liability management to adapt asset exposures and funding structures, and employ multi-year capital planning and stress testing—under both internal scenarios and regulators’ CCAR and DFAST exercises—to ensure maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Senior management, through an enterprise risk management framework and a firmwide enterprise risk committee, integrates scenario analyses combining market, credit, liquidity, operational and compliance shocks and oversees resolution and recovery plans that define mitigation strategies, triggers and alerts, and single point of entry resolution strategies to reconstitute trajectories and conserve capital and liquidity in emergency situations. A global business resilience committee and cross-functional risk committees oversee operational risk controls, vendor concentration, cyber-security, and infrastructure dependencies to preserve system integrity under extreme events and maintain operational continuity. Independent model risk management validates all valuation, risk and capital models, and credit risk management enforces counterparty limits and collateral agreements to mitigate credit exposures while the firm’s mid-year and annual stress-test driven capital plans gauge organizational strength, adaptability and future orientation in sustaining core functions, strategic objectives and competitive advantage during unexpected disruptions.

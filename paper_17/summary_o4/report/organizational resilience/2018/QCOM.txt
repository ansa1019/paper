We have historically been successful during wireless technology transitions and expect initial commercial deployments of 5G devices to begin in calendar 2019, underscoring our focus on continuous adaptation and the maintenance of business continuity under disruptive technological conditions. We believe it is important that we be a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and develop, commercialize and be a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products and services in order to sustain and grow our business long-term. Our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features; develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points; drive the adoption of our integrated circuit products across a broad spectrum of devices and industry segments beyond traditional cellular communications; and continue to innovate and introduce 4G and 5G turnkey, integrated products and services that differentiate us from our competition. We acknowledge that our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and industry segments may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations, and that manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, which in less favorable industry environments could result in lower utilization rates and lower gross profit. We further disclose that if tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes or other natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts were to damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay new production and shipments of inventory or result in costly repairs, and that our operations depend on securing raw materials and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, while the loss of firm commitments from suppliers could leave capacity unavailable when we need it. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance, with difficulties potentially reducing yields or interrupting production and impairing our ability to deliver products in a timely, cost-effective or competitive manner. We also recognize that third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, posing risks of misappropriation, theft, misuse or loss of intellectual property, as well as damage to our competitive position, reputation and potential legal or regulatory exposure. We further caution that a decline in economic conditions, changes in laws, regulations, policies or standards, and the challenges associated with attracting and retaining qualified employees in a highly competitive market could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. To address these challenges, we announced a cost plan in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 designed to align our cost structure to long-term margin targets, aiming to reduce annual costs by $1 billion while acknowledging that these initiatives may be more costly or time-consuming than expected or potentially disruptive to our operations. We have also articulated that achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses efficiently and effectively, and that our indebtedness and share repurchase program may reduce financial flexibility, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, require cash for debt service and expose us to adverse economic, market, industry and competitive conditions.

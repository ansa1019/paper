Starbucks discloses that it operates in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing environment, where new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict their full impact on business continuity, financial condition or results of operations, and that prolonged adverse economic conditions may lead consumers to make long‐lasting changes in discretionary purchasing behavior.  To preserve brand value and bolster organizational health under challenging conditions, the Company invests substantially in training and support for store partners, monitors the operations of company‐operated and licensed stores to mitigate service and product quality risks beyond its direct control, and makes significant capital expenditures and other outlays for technology platforms, third‐party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber‐attacks, minimize breaches of information systems and enable effective incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity.  Starbucks further identifies risks to its supply chain—such as natural disasters, geopolitical events, trade restrictions, reliance on single or limited suppliers and severe weather—that could interrupt the production or delivery of its products, and manages these risks through insurance, diversification of suppliers, commodity hedging for coffee, dairy and other key inputs, and derivative instruments to reduce volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company acknowledges that its success depends on effectively managing growth and strategic initiatives—such as digital relationships, delivery services, new store formats, channel development partnerships and international expansion—that require resource allocation decisions, operational flexibility, balancing local autonomy with global consistency and the ability to reconfigure and adapt trajectories of responses to disruptive events.  Starbucks maintains committed credit facilities and a commercial paper program to ensure liquidity and mitigate funding risks under unexpected conditions, and regularly evaluates its portfolio through acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and impairment charges to streamline operations, reconstitute focus on high‐return businesses and preserve or improve performance under pressure.

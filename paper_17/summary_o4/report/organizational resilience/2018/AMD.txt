In our risk disclosures, we emphasize reliance on third-party wafer foundries, assembly, test, mark and pack providers and ATMP joint ventures to meet our manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment requirements, and acknowledge that any failure by these suppliers to deliver timely, sufficient or quality products—whether due to capacity constraints, yield shortfalls, raw-material shortages, facility damage or changes in supplier priorities—could require us to allocate limited supply among customers, delay product introductions, miss design windows, incur excess inventory or otherwise materially impair our financial condition and customer relationships. We note that our lack of long-term manufacturing commitments with some suppliers heightens our dependence on purchase orders and exposes us to risks of fluctuating supply and price volatility, while any transition to new manufacturers can lead to delayed introductions, lower yields or performance issues. We also disclose exposure to geopolitical, economic and natural disaster risks—including trade tariffs, Brexit-related uncertainty, public health crises, earthquakes, flooding and other extreme events—as well as to security vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks that can compromise sensitive data and intellectual property, disrupt key business operations, impose significant remediation costs and damage our reputation, and we anticipate increasing investments in information security controls, workforce training and regulatory compliance to mitigate such hazards. On the financial side, we describe our need to maintain sufficient cash flows, external financing capacity and access to a secured revolving credit facility, while complying with debt covenants, cross-default provisions and limitations on indebtedness, restricted payments and asset dispositions that could constrain our flexibility in economic downturns. Finally, we recognize the cyclical, competitive and technologically dynamic nature of the semiconductor industry and the importance of robust product road maps, research and development, strategic partnerships and diversified manufacturing to foresee, confront and adapt to market fluctuations, competitor actions, seasonal demand patterns and customer design cycles, all of which are critical to preserving performance, continuity of operations and organizational resilience under challenging conditions.

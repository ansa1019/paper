The Company’s annual report describes an organizational approach that seeks to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity by maintaining system integrity and performance under internal and external variations—from intense competitive pressures and evolving technology standards to security incidents, data-center outages, natural disasters, climate-related events, pandemics and regulatory changes—through continual risk assessment and mitigation, disaster recovery and business continuity planning, capacity provisioning and redundancy, and incident response protocols. It highlights the need to anticipate emerging standards, business models and customer needs, to reconstitute and reconfigure product and service delivery trajectories via ongoing research and development, subscription-based and multi-year agreements, and targeted resource allocation for innovation, integration of acquired technologies and services, and inter-organizational collaboration. Financial resilience is supported by hedging foreign-currency exposures, maintaining credit facilities and prudent liquidity management, while operational flexibility is reinforced by robust security measures, governance controls, supplier and channel risk oversight, change management processes and a corporate culture designed to foster agility, knowledge sharing and continuous learning, all aimed at enabling recovery mechanisms, adaptive strategies and performance maintenance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

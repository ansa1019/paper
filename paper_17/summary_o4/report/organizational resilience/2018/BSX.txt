The annual report discloses numerous operational and strategic initiatives reflecting our capacity to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including the necessity “to devote continued efforts and financial resources to the development or acquisition of scientifically advanced technologies and products” and to “apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards,” thereby preserving functioning and performance amid rapid technological change. We recognize that failure to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products “could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations,” and that “delays in the timing of the launch of next‐generation products and the overall performance of, and continued physician confidence in, those products may result in declines in our market share,” illustrating the importance of adaptation and resource allocation. Competitive pressures, consolidation of customers, economic pressures and managed care reforms are identified as risks that “may adversely impact market sizes, our share of markets, average selling prices and medical procedure volumes,” underscoring the need for resilience strategies to confront external pressures and uncertainty. The company monitors “the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues,” which has led to restructuring and optimization initiatives “intended to support our effort to improve operating performance and meet anticipated market demands by ensuring that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value,” though such measures “could yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity.” Global expansion efforts in emerging markets—where net sales grew 18.0 percent in 2018—illustrate a systemic perspective and future orientation, yet also entail “geopolitical and economic instability, foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations, competitive product offerings, local changes in healthcare financing and delivery systems, workforce instability” and other uncertainties that “may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy.” We confront regulatory and legal volatility through extensive compliance programs, yet acknowledge that “the global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products,” and that “any adverse regulatory action … could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.” Financial resilience is addressed through capital-structure management, including the use of financial leverage and maintenance of investment-grade credit ratings to manage cost of borrowing and liquidity, and through contingency planning for debt covenant compliance. Integration risks are highlighted by the warning that “failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business” and that successful integration “requires significant efforts, including corporate restructuring and the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance.” Supply-chain continuity is emphasized by our acknowledgment that “disruptions in the supply of materials and components … or the sterilization of our products by third-party vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition,” as demonstrated by recent challenges at a contract sterilizer. The report further addresses exposure to cyber-attacks, product liability, intellectual property litigation, tax law changes, economic downturns, reimbursement pressures, healthcare policy reforms and privacy regulations as multifaceted hazards that require ongoing risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, strategic agility and innovation to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

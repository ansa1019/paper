Throughout our Form 10-K disclosures, the Company acknowledges the importance of maintaining operations and financial stability under adverse conditions by implementing a controlled risk-management program—employing derivative instruments to hedge interest-rate and foreign-currency exposures—and by continuously monitoring economic cycles, customer creditworthiness, healthcare legislation and international funding levels to support liquidity and operational continuity. We recognize that manufacturing difficulties or disruptions, sole-source raw-material constraints or failures of contract manufacturers to meet our standards may result in product shortages and lost revenue, while inadequacies or breaches of our IT systems could disrupt manufacturing, compromise intellectual property, and damage customer relationships and reputation; accordingly, we have implemented measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize cyber-security risks, although these measures may not be fully successful. To preserve organizational health and adaptability in a competitive and regulated environment, we have undertaken strategic initiatives including cost-structure reductions and incurred asset impairment, restructuring, and acquired in-process R&D charges when development programs or market expectations are not met. We also regularly evaluate and execute business-development transactions—such as acquisitions of Armo Biosciences and Loxo, collaborations with Dicerna, and the divestiture of Elanco through an exchange offer and planned spin-off—to reconfigure resource allocation, sustain a continuous flow of new products, support capital expenditures, share repurchases, and debt management, thereby enabling the Company to absorb internal and external pressures and preserve or improve functioning despite volatility and disruptive events.

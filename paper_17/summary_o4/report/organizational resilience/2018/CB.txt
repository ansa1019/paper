Our insurance and reinsurance operations are underpinned by a disciplined underwriting process, underwriting controls, risk models and the purchase of third-party reinsurance to mitigate exposure to natural disasters, terrorism, cyber-attacks and other catastrophic events, supported by geographic diversification of risks and an investment policy that stresses diversification, principal conservation and liquidity; this framework, together with substantial cash balances, highly liquid investments, credit facilities and short-term financing arrangements, provides business continuity and the financial flexibility to meet unforeseen claim demands and preserve system integrity.  Our profit-center structure and decentralized operating model grant senior management teams the autonomy to make underwriting, product development and resource allocation decisions tailored to target customer needs, reinforcing organizational agility and adaptive capacity.  We employ actuarial methods, scenarios, stochastic models and data analytics to analyze exposures, loss trends and other risks, informing both reserve adequacy adjustments and capital deployment, while regularly revising estimates and assumptions to reflect evolving experience and emerging loss drivers.  We proactively implement and upgrade information security measures, incident response plans and vendor oversight to safeguard critical systems, modify procedures as circumstances warrant and absorb internal or external cyber-security shocks.  Strategic initiatives such as acquisition integration and rebranding, Brexit-driven redomiciliation of our European headquarters, enhancements to variable annuity reinsurance structures and collateral arrangements, and the transition from libor demonstrate our future orientation, operational continuity planning and capacity to reconfigure trajectories of response toward disruptive events, preserving organizational strength and fostering positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

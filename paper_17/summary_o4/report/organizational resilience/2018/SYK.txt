The report describes business continuity plans designed to address potential failures of key information technology systems, processes, sites or third-party services, warning that if “our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm.” It details operational flexibility and resource reconfiguration measures in response to “interruption of manufacturing operations” resulting from natural disasters, internal protocol failures or equipment malfunctions, noting risks in moving “quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand” and the possibility of “lengthy delays in resuming production.” Supply chain resilience considerations include reliance on sole-source suppliers for critical raw materials, components and finished devices, where “significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs” and halt production. Compliance with extensive and evolving regulatory requirements—FDA, EU medical device regulations, data privacy laws and anti-corruption statutes—is presented as a mechanism for preserving system integrity and minimizing sanctions, fines or exclusion from government healthcare programs. Financial resilience is articulated through a global cash management strategy that leverages substantial cash from operations, maintains “strong investment-grade” short- and long-term debt ratings, supplements liquidity with a $1.5 billion credit facility and commercial paper program, and prioritizes capital allocation to acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases. The company records liabilities based on management’s “best estimate of the probable loss” for legal, regulatory, recall and tax contingencies and maintains inventory reserves for excess and obsolete stock to absorb strain and preserve functioning, while goodwill and intangible assets undergo annual impairment testing to ensure valuations remain robust under internal or external variations. These practices exemplify anticipatory risk assessment, strategic resource deployment and dynamic adaptation consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

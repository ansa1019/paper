We maintain a diversified set of financing and risk‐management tools to preserve organizational flexibility and ensure business continuity under changing conditions.  Our board periodically approves strategic initiatives—most recently in September 2018 increasing the dividend rate and expanding the share-repurchase program—to retain the financial strength needed to respond to unexpected funding changes.  We analyze global market and economic conditions to optimize our debt portfolio, varying the mix of fixed- and variable-rate borrowings, issuing commercial paper supported by a revolving credit facility and entering into standby letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees to secure performance obligations.  To mitigate currency and interest rate volatility, we employ foreign‐exchange forwards, options and interest-rate swaps designated as cash-flow or fair-value hedges, thereby preserving earnings stability.  Under our contract accounting processes, we identify technical, schedule and cost risks on long-term fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, regularly reassessing total costs to complete, adjusting profit-booking rates and allocating resources to reduce the likelihood of unexpected cost overruns.  We also continually evaluate environmental liabilities and related receivables to ensure compliance and cost recovery, and we invest in our defined benefit pension plans—making $5.0 billion in contributions in 2018 and freezing future benefit accruals—to lock in funding requirements, reduce future volatility and secure long-term obligations.  These practices, together with our ongoing focus on sustaining operating cash flows, capital expenditures and independent research and development, reflect our systemic approach to absorbing strain, adapting to external pressures and maintaining performance under challenging conditions.

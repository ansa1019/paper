The Company discloses that it relies on information technology to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce its financial statements, and warns that if it does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain proper technology infrastructure, it could suffer transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions or loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches.  It emphasizes that its data management systems must effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for planning, forecasting and executing its business plan and for complying with applicable laws and regulations, and that equipment malfunctions, software deficiencies or human error may materially impair these capabilities.  The Company also notes that it uses encryption and authentication technologies, along with user names and passwords, to secure the transmission and storage of customer, employee and business‐partner personally identifiable information—including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information—but acknowledges that these safeguards cannot provide absolute security and may be compromised by third‐party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities, potentially resulting in unauthorized access, reputational harm, reduced use of its products and services, litigation and material adverse effects on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Finally, it warns that the costs to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and that its mitigation efforts may not prevent unexpected interruptions, delays or cessation of service.

The Company discloses that, despite the implementation of system redundancy, security measures and a formal disaster recovery plan for its internal information technology systems, those systems remain vulnerable to damage or disruption from energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber-security attacks (such as computer viruses or unauthorized access), and that any such system failure or accident could materially interrupt operations, give rise to significant remediation costs and expose the Company to violations of privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information (both its own and that of others), legal and financial liabilities, reputational harm, loss or misuse of data and diminished confidence in its safeguard measures.

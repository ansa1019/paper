Competitive factors noted in our risk disclosures include technological innovation, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers, and we acknowledge that remaining competitive requires significant investment in and adaptation to rapid technological change. We further recognize that it may be difficult to implement strategies designed to improve internal growth—such as allocating research and development funding to high-growth products, developing new applications, expanding service offerings, combining sales and marketing operations in key markets and continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to support cross-selling—without robust information technology capabilities. In particular, unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems—such as new enterprise resource planning software and other business applications—could adversely affect our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders, interact with suppliers, fulfill contractual obligations, bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support customers in a timely manner. We rely on our technology infrastructure to conduct these core functions and recognize that our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, cyber-attacks, data loss, non-redundant architectures and insufficient disaster recovery planning, any of which could interrupt services, harm our reputation and adversely affect our financial results.

We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, and their size and complexity make them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, malicious intrusion, breakdowns, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruptions; these systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing platforms and to develop new systems that keep pace with evolving information-processing technology, regulatory standards, increasing demands to safeguard patient and customer information and shifting customer patterns; in addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain patient data or proprietary information, and any failure to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity—including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches—could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, compromise our confidential information and disrupt our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.

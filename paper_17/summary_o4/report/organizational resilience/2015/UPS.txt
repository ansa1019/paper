UPS’s operations critically depend on robust information technology networks and systems—including the Internet—to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities across its corporate, franchisee and shipping network; these networks are used for processing shipments and customer data, operating facility automation projects and the on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“ORION”) and other technology improvements deployed to increase network capacity, operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability. The company acknowledges that its IT systems—many of which are managed by third parties and extend to its franchisees—are susceptible to failures during software or database upgrades, power or telecommunications outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, hacking and other cyber-attacks, which could result in service disruptions, loss of or misuse of proprietary or personal data, damage to the UPS brand, litigation, potential liability and significant costs to remediate and enhance data and system protection measures. UPS therefore invests in data and system security and monitoring systems, engages in cyber risk mitigation and maintains cybersecurity protocols, while balancing capital spending on information management capability—the ability to tailor data to users with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access—in support of business strategies, process automation, operational decision-making and continuous improvement of its global transportation and logistics platform.

The company discloses that it maintains and relies extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures to support the effective operation of its business and to collect, store and transmit confidential information, including personal health data and intellectual property, and acknowledges that the size and complexity of these systems make them vulnerable to service interruptions or security breaches caused by software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, employee misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or similar events, any of which could interrupt internal processes and interfirm transactions, result in loss of critical data or breaches of confidentiality and expose the company to private and governmental liabilities under an evolving landscape of privacy and data protection laws and regulations such as HIPAA, state security breach statutes, consumer protection laws and international frameworks like the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor, as well as to restrictive regulatory actions if it fails to monitor and manage social media communications for adverse event reporting, off-label promotion or inappropriate disclosures; although the company has implemented security measures and a business continuity plan to address such risks, it acknowledges that these efforts may not fully prevent breakdowns or compliance failures that could materially harm its business.

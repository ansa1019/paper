The report underscores that Microsoft’s competitive positioning increasingly rests on the evolution and coordination of its information technology capabilities to support and enhance its business strategies and work processes.  It emphasizes that a growing part of the business involves cloud-based services and that the company is devoting significant resources to develop and deploy its cloud-first strategy—investing in datacenter capacity, network infrastructure, and platform development to maintain the utility, compatibility, performance, security, and reliability of its services across a wide array of devices.  The company’s increasing reliance on data-driven insights to inform monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency, coupled with cultural and organizational changes “to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation,” illustrates its focus on information management capability and the mobilization of IT-based resources in tandem with other strategic assets.  Success in cloud and platform endeavors is linked to bringing compelling, platform-agnostic experiences to market, enhancing attractiveness to third-party developers, and continuously engineering more secure products and services—through timely software updates, mitigation technologies, and digital security infrastructure—to defend against evolving cyber threats.  The discussion of significant investments in research, development, and strategic acquisitions further highlights the firm’s efforts to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure its technology, knowledge, practices, and human resources.  At the same time, the company recognizes that rapid technological change, complex integration projects, and the need for operational flexibility present execution risks, and that its internal IT environment, early adoption of new devices and consumer-oriented technologies, and evolving security controls must keep pace with dynamic market demands and external threats.

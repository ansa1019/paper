The Company discloses that it relies extensively on various information systems—comprising data centers, hardware, software and applications—to process and record transactions in its stores, enable effective communication systems, plan and track inventory flow, manage logistics, generate performance and financial reports and operate e-commerce sites, and that the integrity, security and consistent operation of these systems and related backup and disaster recovery solutions is critical to its operational efficiency and growth. It further notes that supporting, modifying and evolving these systems—through adding new hardware, software and applications, maintaining or replacing legacy programs, converting to global systems, integrating new service providers, enhancing cloud computing technologies or deploying new e-commerce functionality—requires effective and specialized internal and third-party teams to accurately capture and maintain data, securely test and implement changes in a timely manner, realize expected benefits and manage potential disruptions and resource diversions. The report warns that failures to operate information systems or implement new technologies effectively—whether due to power outages, computer or telecommunications failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, design or usage errors, natural disasters or third-party lapses—could disrupt business operations, delay merchandise flow, interrupt website availability, damage reputation, reduce customer willingness to shop in stores or online and expose the Company to regulatory fines and liabilities. The Company acknowledges that compromises of data security—such as unauthorized intrusion into systems or those of third parties, cyber-attacks, or misuse of customer and associate personal, payment card or confidential business information—could materially harm its reputation and business, necessitating robust monitoring, security safeguards and IT governance. As the organization grows across autonomous chains in multiple countries, it faces the risk that its systems, controls, practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or that business information may not be shared appropriately, which could decrease operational efficiency, hinder expansion and responsiveness to customer trends, and impair inventory management, marketing, competitive positioning and strategic decision-making. Moreover, the rapid evolution of internet-based, digital and mobile channels requires the Company to continuously identify opportunities and make timely, actionable IT investments—ranging from marketing tools to e-commerce platforms—to meet changing customer expectations, maintain connectivity, support data management and analytics capabilities, and sustain competitive advantage in a dynamic retail environment.

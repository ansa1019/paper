The company identifies operational risk as arising from “inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, and firms or exchanges handling client orders,” noting that “extraordinary trading volumes could cause the company’s computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail,” and that “it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to the company’s technology or other operating systems,” which “could affect the company’s ability to process and settle client transactions” and “result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction.” To mitigate these risks, the firm “devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of its systems,” maintains two data centers for backup and recovery, and “continuously upgrades, enhances and tests its technology platforms.” The company also “relies on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions,” acknowledging that “switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.” Recognizing the growing threat of cyber attacks, the company’s information security program seeks to ensure the “secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential information about the company and its clients,” employs “advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity,” limits employee access to sensitive data, and provides regular training, yet concedes that “despite the company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches,” including “computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks” and “fraudulent ‘phishing’ emails.” These exposures could “subject the company to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance,” “actions by the company’s regulators,” and “damage to the company’s reputation.” The company’s governance framework includes an information security and privacy sub-committee and a global data subcommittee to oversee cyber security and enterprise data governance, and its model governance subcommittee addresses model risk in its analytical systems. Reflecting its IT investment priorities, capital expenditures for “land, leasehold improvements, information technology equipment and software” totaled $285 million in 2015, with $107 million of capitalized internal-use software development costs (compared with $81 million and $74 million in 2014 and 2013), while “professional services” expenses include higher spending on technology services and software maintenance, and “depreciation and amortization” expense rose due to the amortization of internally-developed software associated with the company’s “investment in software and technology enhancements.”

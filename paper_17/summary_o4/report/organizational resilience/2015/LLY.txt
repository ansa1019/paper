We depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, both within the company and through outsourced service providers, to support our business operations, financial transactional processes and the management of valuable confidential information, including trade secrets, strategic plans, customer and employee data, and intellectual property. A great deal of this information resides in our information systems, networks and facilities or those of third parties, and rapid growth in mobile computing capacity, high-speed internet access and social media has exacerbated the risk of unauthorized disclosure, theft or corruption of data. We have invested and continue to invest to prevent, monitor, detect and respond to information security breaches by strengthening employee awareness and training, enhancing IT systems and business processes, and imposing rigorous data protection requirements on third parties, yet we recognize that vulnerabilities such as computer malware, malicious intrusions, energy or telecommunications failures, natural disasters, terrorism, war or routine breakdowns could impair our ability to secure and maintain our competitive advantages, expose us to regulatory penalties and enforcement actions, damage our reputation and disrupt our operations.

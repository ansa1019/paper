Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace rapidly and, for Google, provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users, and as our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology, market trends, and consumer needs, and we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices, in response to users’ increasing use of mobile phones, tablets, game consoles and other alternative Internet-access devices and to local market requirements in developing economies. The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks, computer viruses or denial of service attacks, and our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities that could result in interruptions or failures of our systems. Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability, and we expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches as regulatory authorities worldwide consider new data protection and encryption requirements, data localization laws and transfer restrictions. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, and new technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads or enable users to opt out of our advertising products, which could impair our ability to monetize traffic under our shared-revenue arrangements with network members and distribution partners. Finally, our capital expenditures and operating cash flow reflect substantial investments in systems, data centers, real estate and facilities, information technology infrastructure and strategic acquisitions that support our technology deployment, connectivity, resilience and long-term competitive advantage.

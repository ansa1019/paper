We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services—including Internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties—to assist in conducting our business; our global business services organization provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable our business units and market operations teams to better understand the business and better serve consumers and customers by delivering world-class solutions at low cost and minimal capital investment.  These IT systems, networks and services support a broad range of business processes, including ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, collecting, transmitting, transferring and storing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, summarizing and reporting results of operations, hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, providing data security and handling other processes necessary to manage our business.  We recognize that a breach of information security—including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key IT systems, networks, hardware, processes, associated sites or service providers—could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation, and we therefore continue to assess potential threats and make investments to address these threats, including enhanced network and systems monitoring, security policy enhancements and employee and provider training; however, if our IT systems, networks or service providers fail to function properly, or if our business continuity plans do not effectively address such failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.

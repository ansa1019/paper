AbbVie’s 2015 Form 10-K acknowledges that the company depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its global business and that a failure or breach of those systems—whether from malicious intrusion, random attack, data privacy loss or simple breakdown—could materially and adversely affect its operations, financial condition and cash flows. The Company states that it has invested in protecting its data and IT infrastructure and monitors these systems on an ongoing basis, but cannot guarantee that its safeguards will prevent all system failures or security incidents. AbbVie further discloses that changes in the ability of third parties providing information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to meet their contractual obligations could create operational inefficiencies, compromise information management and connectivity across internal processes, and negatively impact its business performance and compliance.

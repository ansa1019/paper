The company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information, while acknowledging that these systems are vulnerable to a variety of threats—including cyber-attacks, malware, ransomware, advanced persistent threats and improper actions by employees, vendors or other third parties—and that the breadth and complexity of its infrastructure, encompassing mobile technologies, cloud services, social media and internet-connected devices, increases the risk of security breaches. It recognizes that encryption, multi-factor authentication and timely patch management across numerous systems and platforms require substantial time and resources and that dependence on third-party vendors like cloud service providers adds further cybersecurity risk if those vendors fail to maintain adequate controls. In discussing its acquisition strategy, the company highlights the complexity of integrating acquired businesses’ information systems and the potential for unidentified system weaknesses to expose it to unexpected liabilities, impede realization of acquisition value or make its own systems more vulnerable to attack. The company also warns that its policies, procedures and technical safeguards may not always prevent or detect improper access or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information and notes that data incidents and breaches—whether from phishing campaigns, human error or malware incursions—have occurred and could recur, with the firm possibly unable to anticipate new attack techniques, detect incidents promptly, assess their impact or respond in time to prevent material harm. It further observes that proliferating and sometimes conflicting privacy and data protection laws—such as the EU GDPR and various data localization mandates—impose significant compliance costs and operational constraints on the movement of sensitive client and company data across borders, and that unauthorized disclosure could trigger substantial litigation, regulatory fines, criminal prosecution and reputational damage. Finally, the company underscores the importance of robust business continuity and disaster-recovery planning to safeguard its technology infrastructure and ability to deliver services in the face of natural or man-made disasters, power or telecommunications failures or cyber-attacks on its own systems or those of key vendors. In its management discussion, the firm emphasizes the strategic imperative to anticipate and respond to digital disruption, invest in technology systems and infrastructure, deploy new processes to capture efficiencies, integrate relevant technologies and methodologies into its product and service offerings and depend on key vendors and partners, warning that failure to keep pace with technological change or to execute strategic technology initiatives effectively could adversely affect its competitive position, operational efficiency, data security and overall ability to support and transform its business.

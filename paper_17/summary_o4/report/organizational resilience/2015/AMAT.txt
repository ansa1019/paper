Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across segments, a process that implies integrated coordination of its assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships through information-driven systems. Its distributed manufacturing model and reliance on outsourced functions—including engineering, software development, information technology support and finance—require changes to existing operations and the adoption of new business processes, procedures and controls to realize productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect intellectual property. To support global transaction processing and supply chain management, Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes, including enhancements to back-office and information technology infrastructure, although during such transitions it must continue to rely on legacy information systems that may be costly or inefficient and may not deliver anticipated benefits. The company notes exposure to risks from information technology or infrastructure failures, which could interrupt manufacturing operations, delay product and service delivery, increase costs or trigger order cancellations. In its business activities, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including confidential and personally-identifiable information, and has experienced cybersecurity threats ranging from employee error to advanced persistent threats; it devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other protective measures but acknowledges that cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption, data misappropriation, reputational harm, litigation and increased remediation costs.

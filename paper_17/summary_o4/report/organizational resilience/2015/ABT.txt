Abbott’s disclosures emphasize its reliance on sophisticated information technology systems designed to support and enhance business strategies and work processes, noting that these systems coordinate assets across its global manufacturing, research and development, and commercial operations. The company warns that the size and complexity of its IT infrastructure make it vulnerable to cyber attacks, malicious intrusions, system breakdowns, data destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruptions, and acknowledges that, despite substantial investments in system protections, data security measures and ongoing monitoring for current and potential threats, there can be no assurance that future interruptions will not materially affect its results of operations. Moreover, Abbott’s capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion annually in 2015, 2014 and 2013 included significant investments in information technology alongside upgrades to facilities and laboratory instrumentation, underscoring its commitment to mobilizing and deploying IT resources in support of operational efficiency, risk management and value creation.

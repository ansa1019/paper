The company’s risk factors disclose that its business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions, which may be caused by natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other events, and that system redundancy may be ineffective and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could, among other things, prevent access to the company’s online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders, impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transaction processing and financial reporting, and materially damage customer and partner relationships or expose the company to significant legal, financial and reputational consequences. The company’s business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information (“PII”) and to deploy user names and passwords to access its information technology systems, encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data, and ongoing monitoring of accounts and systems for unusual activity, with authority to freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances; however, these measures cannot provide absolute security. The company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data, maintains insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risk and conducts disaster recovery planning, yet acknowledges that breaches of its information technology systems could materially damage customer and partner relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to critical services and expose the company to loss or litigation. The company also relies on access to third-party digital content and software applications, which may require it to provide digital rights management and other security solutions and could necessitate the development or licensing of new technology should requirements change. In addition, the company has devoted substantial capital expenditures—$11.2 billion in fiscal 2015 and approximately $15.0 billion anticipated in fiscal 2016—to data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and retail store facilities, and its retail stores have required significant investment in information systems, inventory and personnel. Compliance with evolving federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy, security and transfer, as well as payment card industry standards, remains a continuing focus of its governance framework and may necessitate material changes to its information systems and business practices.

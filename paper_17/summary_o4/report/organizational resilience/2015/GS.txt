The firm’s disclosures emphasize that its businesses “are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies,” and that these transactions and “the information technology services we provide to clients” must adhere to client-specific guidelines and evolving legal and regulatory reporting requirements. As client volumes, speeds, frequencies and the complexity of electronic transactions grow, “developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging,” and “systems or human error in connection with such transactions” poses heightened risk given their speed and volume. The firm warns that its financial, accounting, data-processing and other operational systems “may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume,” and notes that it must “continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets,” although “systems enhancements and updates … entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.” The disclosures further recognize that “notwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems, our businesses ultimately rely on human beings as our greatest resource,” and that mistakes “in software development or implementation” can occur. The firm identifies risks of “operational failure … of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries … and, as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, … operational failure with respect to our clients’ systems.” It describes resiliency planning to guard against “a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses,” including disruptions to “electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet … or cloud service providers.” Cybersecurity is highlighted as a key concern: the firm “is regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-of-service attacks,” must “continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption,” and faces the possibility that “encryption and other protective measures … may be defeated” as well as the inability to ensure that third-party vendors, clients or service providers “have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information.” These disclosures collectively underscore the firm’s recognition that mobilizing and deploying robust IT systems, maintaining secure networks and continuously adapting its technology infrastructure are critical to supporting complex business processes, managing risk, complying with regulatory obligations and enhancing its operational resilience.

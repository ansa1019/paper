Facebook’s ability to compete and innovate hinges on its IT capability, which encompasses the design, deployment, and scaling of its proprietary data centers, servers, network capacity and computing power to support rapid growth in users and engagement; the development and maintenance of highly technical software and internal systems that store, retrieve, process and manage immense volumes of data; and the delivery of user-facing products—such as news feed, mobile and web applications, messaging and developer integrations—across mobile operating systems, networks and standards it does not control.  This capability requires mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with human resources and management skills to develop new products, update ranking algorithms, enable secure payment transactions, and provide data and information with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security and confidentiality.  Facebook invests in connectivity efforts, virtual reality platforms and artificial intelligence research, and leverages open source contributions and acquired technologies, while managing the integration of personnel, amortizing intangible assets, and retaining talent through share-based compensation.  IT governance at Facebook involves balancing short- and long-term investment decisions to enhance the aggregate user experience and monetization, enforcing developer policies to optimize distribution and engagement, and complying with evolving privacy and data protection regulations.  Risks to this IT capability include undetected software bugs or vulnerabilities, malware and phishing attacks, interoperability challenges with third-party platforms, supply chain disruptions for hardware, performance delays or outages due to inadequate redundancy, and the operational complexity of building and operating the infrastructure needed to meet growing demands and strategic objectives.

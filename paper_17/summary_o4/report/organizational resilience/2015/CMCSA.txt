Our risk disclosures recognize that “technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior,” and emphasize that “our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage.” We caution that if “we choose technology or equipment that is not as effective or attractive to consumers as that employed by our competitors, if we fail to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors do so, or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiatives, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.” Accordingly, we continually invest in and deploy advanced network and customer-facing technologies—“the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1, X1 set-top boxes, wireless gateways and cloud DVR technology”—and support them through substantial technical and product support spending “including costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning.” While our cable communications business “is attempting to adapt to changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying our X1 platform and cloud DVR technology,” we acknowledge that new services continue to emerge that compete with our video offerings. We further highlight that “network and information systems and other technologies, including those related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery, are critical to our business activities,” and that any “network and information systems–related events … could result in a degradation or disruption of our services, excessive call volume to call centers or damage to our equipment, data and properties.” In addition, we warn that “any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel and vendor data, could damage our reputation and require us to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach, and could cause regulators to impose fines or other remedies for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rules.” Finally, we note that “while we develop and maintain systems, and operate a comprehensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated,” and that “there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.”

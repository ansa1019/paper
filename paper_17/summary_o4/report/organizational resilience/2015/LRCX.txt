The company’s disclosures underscore a critical dependence on information systems and related technology resources to coordinate its assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions and relationships, noting that “during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our work force, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis.” It further acknowledges that its manufacturing facilities are exposed to “disruptions of our information technology resources” and that “outsourced providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization.” In describing its critical information systems, the company identifies “telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail,” including hosted cloud computing applications for confidential data storage, and warns that all of these systems are subject to threats such as viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures and physical damage, any of which could compromise the “accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access” of information and thereby “unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business.”

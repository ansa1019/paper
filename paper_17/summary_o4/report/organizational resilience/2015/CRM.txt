Our disclosures emphasize that our enterprise cloud computing platform represents an evolving IT capability that coordinates internal processes, assets and interfirm transactions by integrating proprietary and third-party hardware, software, network and data resources across global data-center hosting facilities. We highlight our information management capability—providing customers with accurate, timely, reliable, secure and confidential data transmission and storage—supported by near-real-time replication for disaster recovery and business continuity. We recognize that unauthorized access to our IT systems or customer data, whether through security breaches, employee error, malicious third-party action or inadequately secured customer-authorized technology providers, could damage our reputation, interrupt services and expose us to legal and financial liabilities. We rely on third-party computer hardware, software and cloud platforms and face challenges in integrating acquired technologies into our multi-tenant architecture while maintaining quality standards, operational flexibility and scalability. Our disclosures also address the impact of evolving regulations on cross-border data transfers and privacy, the need to invest continuously in data-center capacity and network infrastructure, and the importance of mobilizing IT-based resources in support of business strategies, customer relationships, competitive positioning and firm performance.

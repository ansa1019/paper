Berkshire acknowledges that it “relies on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business” and that “a significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against intruders, and other operational difficulties.”  The company has undertaken business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analyses to mitigate such risks, but warns that “a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of assets or data corruption and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.”  Berkshire further cautions that “if we are unable to acquire or implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage,” that “attacks perpetrated against our information systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and exposes us to remediation costs and reputational damage,” and that “cyber attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential customer and employee information.”  In its railroad business, regulatory mandates requiring “implementation of positive train control technology by December 31, 2018” and “electronically controlled pneumatic braking systems” by 2021–2023 illustrate technology deployment risks, implementation challenges, extensive testing requirements and significant capital expenditures.  These disclosures underscore the importance of robust IT governance, information security, business process resilience and strategic technology deployment to support Berkshire’s decentralized operating model, safeguard critical data, maintain service levels, comply with regulatory requirements and preserve competitive advantage.

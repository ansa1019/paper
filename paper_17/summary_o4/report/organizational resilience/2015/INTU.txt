Our report discloses our expectation that we will continue to invest significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and that we will solve problems faster and more efficiently by moving to more open platforms with application programming interfaces that enable the contributions of end users and third-party developers and by expanding our third-party technology relationships and strategic partnerships in support of our connected services strategy.  As we transition our business to more connected services, we have become increasingly dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers, including, for example, third-party internet-based or “cloud” computing services, and we are in the process of updating our customer-facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet our customers’ expectations for continuous service availability.  We acknowledge that we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, that many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and that our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities, such that any difficulties in upgrading these applications or infrastructure or failures of our systems or those of our third-party service providers could result in unplanned service disruptions, loss of data or processing capabilities, and damage to our reputation and operating results.  We further recognize that our business operations, data centers, information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, malicious attacks, system failures and other events beyond our control, that we rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests and host certain online activities, and that any interruption or failure of those systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or may cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed.  Our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security, high-availability capabilities and other information systems, and to host, collect, use and retain sensitive and personal customer and employee information and data, may be costly and may not provide absolute security, and if our measures fail, we could experience security breaches that materially disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, materially harm our reputation and cause regulatory scrutiny and financial losses.  We also emphasize our reliance on various third-party partners—including software and service providers, manufacturers, distributors, financial institutions and platform owners such as Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store—to deliver and operate our offerings, and we note the risks that arise if these partners fail to provide acceptable products, services or technologies or change pricing structures, terms of service or policies, any of which could disrupt our operations and harm our financial results.  In our management’s discussion and analysis, we further highlight that future revenue growth and competitive positioning depend on our ability to adapt to technological change, innovate and develop new products, services and business models, develop the requisite skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, and maintain and upgrade our network and data center infrastructure and internal technology systems, since any prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating, upgrading or integrating our systems and architecture could prevent us from delivering existing offerings, developing new offerings and sustaining competitive advantage.

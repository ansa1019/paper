Visa’s global payments network and transaction processing systems constitute its core IT capability, requiring the firm to deploy and maintain distributed authorization, clearing and settlement platforms that provide accurate, timely and secure data to users worldwide. The company relies on third‐party service providers for communications capacity across its global data network and incurs significant network and processing expenses, including maintenance, equipment rental and data processing fees, to support operational efficiency and digital solutions. Evolving privacy, data protection and cybersecurity regulations in multiple jurisdictions—including consumer breach‐notification laws, anti‐money‐laundering and sanctions requirements and central‐bank mandates for systemically important payment systems—impact how Visa uses and handles data, operates its products and services and determines its ability to offer new technologies. Visa continues to invest in technology assets and infrastructure, capitalizing and depreciating software and hardware to support core business initiatives, while recognizing that system malfunctions, natural disasters, telecommunications disruptions, cyberattacks or data breaches could compromise transaction integrity, damage its brand reputation, increase remediation costs and impair its competitive position. The firm’s IT governance and capacity to tailor information management capabilities to changing business needs and regulatory contexts are therefore critical to sustaining its market responsiveness, operational flexibility and secure, reliable service delivery.

Our operations are heavily dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and modification or interruption of such systems may be costly, disruptive and impair our internal controls.  We continually assess whether our information systems and applications are sufficiently scalable to support business growth and evolving needs, often requiring modifications or upgrades that expose us to operational risks.  As our IT environment evolves, we are embracing mobility and cloud-based data sharing to promote business efficiency, yet these practices can result in a more distributed IT environment, complicating our visibility, control, scalability and administrative requirements.  If our security controls fail to keep pace with rapid change or if we cannot satisfy regulatory and compliance mandates, our business would be materially adversely affected.  We maintain sensitive data on our networks, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable worker data, and our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or breaches due to system disruptions, human error or malfeasance, which can be difficult to detect immediately and costly to remediate.  We anticipate increased costs related to implementing new data security procedures, upgrading computer and network security, training employees to monitor security measures, remediating breaches and addressing resultant litigation and reputational harm.  We also partner with third-party providers for key IT support services—help desk support, desktop applications, business and software support, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access—and cannot guarantee these providers will fulfill their obligations timely and in accordance with contract terms, as failures could materially adversely affect our internal operations and product distribution.  Further, we are working to simplify, consolidate and standardize our information systems and applications, but there can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience disruption in connection with this transition.  In the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan focused on simplifying our business and better aligning resources, which includes outsourcing certain IT services and application development.

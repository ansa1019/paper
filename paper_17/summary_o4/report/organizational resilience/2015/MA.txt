Mastercard’s 2015 Form 10-K discloses that rapid and significant technological developments in areas such as smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and blockchain could render its current IT architecture and technology functionalities obsolete and place the company at a competitive disadvantage if it fails to anticipate or adopt these innovations.  The company relies on third parties—including competitors and potential competitors—for development of and access to new technologies and warns that industry-wide solutions and standards (for example, EMV, tokenization or other safety and security technologies), customer or merchant resistance, intellectual property constraints and difficulties in attracting and retaining technology experts can inhibit its ability to develop, deploy and evolve its systems, services and products.  Mastercard works with large digital and other technology companies that leverage its technology to enhance payment safety and security and deliver payment-related products and services efficiently to consumers, and it cautions that inability to keep pace technologically may harm its customer relationships, encourage customers to adopt their own technology and weaken its competitive position.  The company emphasizes its dependence on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in its computer systems, networks and global payments infrastructure, while acknowledging heightened information-security and service-disruption risks—such as cyber-attacks (including computer viruses, malicious code and phishing), data breaches, technology malfunctions, third-party failures and inadequate infrastructure in certain markets—that could lead to unauthorized data disclosure or destruction, service interruptions, reputational harm, regulatory penalties, increased costs and financial losses.  In response, Mastercard maintains a multi-layered information security program, business-continuity planning, insurance coverage, periodic testing of systems and close management of third-party vendor relationships, yet notes that the evolving nature of these threats, its global scale and its role in the payments industry continue to heighten its exposure to potential disruptions and breaches.

UnitedHealth Group describes a broad, enterprise-wide reliance on advanced, enabling technology and integrated information systems to support its UnitedHealthcare and Optum platforms, noting that Optum “provides information and technology-enabled health services” and maintains a large, statistically de-identified database of administrative and clinical data. The company reports an ongoing, significant commitment of resources to “consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities” to keep pace with technology initiatives, regulatory requirements and business acquisitions, as well as to develop new systems and sophisticated mobile applications in response to consumer engagement trends. It emphasizes that its ability to price products and services adequately, deliver efficient and uninterrupted customer service and report financial results hinges on the integrity, accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access of its data and information systems. UnitedHealth Group further highlights the critical importance of seamless interoperability and connectivity among competing technologies, acknowledges risks from cyber-attacks, privacy or data security breaches and evolving health information technology regulations, and underscores its dependence on contractual and intellectual property protections—and limited oversight of third-party security controls—to safeguard databases, software and related products, thereby preserving its capacity for process optimization, business transformation and strategic decision-making.

Nvidia’s operations depend on robust IT capabilities to support business management, communication, over-the-air updates, software development and data security. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist in the design, simulation and verification of new products, enabling timely market introductions. Security breaches, malware and cyber-attacks have occurred on our systems and may exploit vulnerabilities in both our networks and our consumer and automotive products, which utilize over-the-air updates. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means such as actions by an employee with system access. Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary, sensitive or confidential information could expose affected parties to misuse of information, resulting in litigation, liability, reputation damage and operational disruptions, including interruptions, delays or cessation of service that may cause lost customers, delayed sales or lower margins. A majority of our principal IT datacenters are located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters, information technology system failures, power or telecommunications disruptions and other business interruptions that could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt critical functions. These dependencies and external influences underscore the importance of maintaining and continually enhancing our IT capabilities—particularly in areas of security, connectivity, reliability, operational flexibility and disaster resilience—to support our strategic objectives, operational processes and competitive positioning.

Nee and FPL disclose that they are highly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to support the continuous functioning of their highly regulated operations, the processing and monitoring of very large and complex transaction volumes across diverse markets, customer data management and critical business functions. They recognize that the development, modification, integration and replacement of existing or new information systems is costly, operationally challenging and fraught with risks—ranging from system failures or disabling events caused by operator error, severe weather, cyber‐attacks or third‐party disruptions, to unauthorized access, data breaches or identity theft—that could compromise sensitive confidential data, impede revenue tracking and collection, disrupt regulatory reporting and control environments, divert management and employee resources and expose the companies to fines, legal claims and reputational harm.

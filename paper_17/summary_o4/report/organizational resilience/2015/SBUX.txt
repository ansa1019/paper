Our risk disclosures highlight that our information technology systems—encompassing point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms (including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs), administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, and the systems of our third-party partners—house sensitive customer, employee and proprietary data and that any unauthorized access, theft, use or destruction of that data, whether through cyber-attacks or other methods, could materially damage our reputation, brand, customer retention and business continuity and require significant investments in security technologies, personnel and processes. We further disclose that, despite substantial investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent breaches, our security measures cannot ensure the complete prevention of future incidents. We rely heavily on information technology across our operations—including supply chain management, Starbucks Cards, online business, mobile ordering and loyalty functionality—and our ability to coordinate production, distribution and sales depends critically on the reliability, integrity, capacity and security of these systems. We also recognize that reliance on a limited number of third-party providers and the absence of full redundancy within and across markets, combined with potential failures due to power outages, software flaws, system transitions or security breaches, could disrupt our business if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans prove ineffective. In support of our strategic initiatives, we continue to drive convenience and brand engagement through our mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities, investing in digital platforms for in-store initiatives such as mobile order and pay and pursuing ongoing digital innovation across our international markets.

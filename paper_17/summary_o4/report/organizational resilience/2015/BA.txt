Business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition if our information technology or cyber-security measures are compromised, as threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, information systems or networks could result in significant production delays, manipulation or improper use of our data, financial losses and reputational harm. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems and those of certain customers, but recognize that failures or sophisticated cyber-attacks could nevertheless disrupt internal processes, impair customer relationships and impede delivery of products and services. Unauthorized access to or release of our customersâ€™ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, including through our management of customer information systems, could damage our reputation and result in withheld payments, contractual penalties or reduced future business.

The Companyâ€™s significant investments in information management capability are reflected in its continuous upgrading, enhancement and expansion of payroll, financial, accounting and other data processing systems to safeguard, collect, use, transmit and store large amounts of personal and business information, including payroll and tax data, with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access. The Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its operating environments, systems and processes, and has programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, although hardware, software or applications it develops or procures from third parties may contain defects or vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or systems. The Company believes it maintains a robust program of information security and controls and has implemented disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures, but acknowledges that evolving malicious tactics and techniques used by unauthorized parties may require significant additional investments to modify and enhance its controls or remediate security vulnerabilities. In support of its business strategies and growth objectives, the Company continues to invest in product innovation, as evidenced by increased systems development and programming costs to develop, support and maintain its solutions, the expansion of its cloud-based human capital management platforms, and strategic investments to grow and scale its HR outsourcing services by leveraging its technology platforms and processes.

Blackstone relies heavily on its financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems, which may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of tampering or a breach of its network security systems or otherwise, and faces ongoing cybersecurity threats and attacks that could involve unauthorized access to proprietary information, destruction of data or disablement, degradation or sabotage of its systems (often through the introduction of computer viruses, cyberattacks and other means and originating from a wide variety of sources, including unknown third parties); if its systems are compromised, do not operate properly or are disabled, the firm could suffer financial loss, a disruption of its businesses, liability to its investment funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. In addition, Blackstone operates in businesses that are highly dependent on information systems and technology, and its information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate its growth or the cost of maintaining such systems may increase materially, any of which could have a material adverse effect. The firm also depends on its New York City headquarters and the infrastructure supporting electronic communications or other services used by it or by third parties with whom it conducts business, and a disaster or disruption of these services—or of the infrastructure directly affecting its headquarters—could have a material adverse impact on its ability to continue operations without interruption, despite its disaster recovery programs and insurance coverage. Finally, Blackstone relies on third-party service providers for certain aspects of its business, including for information systems and technology and the administration of its hedge funds, and any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures of their information systems and technology could impair the quality of its funds’ operations, harm its reputation and adversely affect its businesses.

The company discloses that it is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure, including cloud-based computing, and that any significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure—whether caused by its workforce, by others with authorized access, by unauthorized persons or by disruptions at third-party providers—could negatively impact operations. It recognizes that the ever-increasing use and evolution of technology creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in its systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices and exposes it to business interruption, espionage attacks, malware and other cyber-attacks or insider threats that may compromise system infrastructure or lead to data leakage. Although the company monitors its data and personnel usage of company systems and has an internal social media policy, it acknowledges that its efforts may not prevent service interruption or the loss of critical or sensitive information and that the inappropriate or unauthorized use of social media could cause brand damage, information leakage or legal implications, including from the improper collection or dissemination of personally identifiable information. The company further notes its reliance on third parties—including suppliers, alliances with other companies and service providers—for development, manufacture, commercialization of products and support for its information technology systems.

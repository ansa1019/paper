The Company identifies that breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations and disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which it operates may materially affect results of operations; a breach of our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information; and breaches of our information technology systems—whether caused by computer viruses, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism—could compromise our information technology networks and could result in unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information, cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations, result in release of employee personal data, or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs. The Company’s global sales force and broad product portfolio attract tens of millions of visits to its web site each year, where customers often begin their initial product searches and design-in journey. In its risk management and financial reporting, the Company recognizes revenue net of allowances based on analysis of historical data, current economic conditions and contractual terms, continually monitors the actual claimed allowances against its estimates and adjusts its estimates as appropriate, and monitors collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging. Inventory valuation allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales. The Company’s liquidity management includes a variable-rate revolving credit facility that also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. The Company further discloses that its inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect its results of operations and that it depends on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development, reflecting risks associated with access to and deployment of technology resources critical to business strategies and processes.

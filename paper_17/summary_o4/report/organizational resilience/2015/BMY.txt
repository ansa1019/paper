BMS acknowledges that it is increasingly dependent on information technology and that its systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security and data leakage, and that a significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure—whether by its workforce, others with authorized access or unauthorized persons—could negatively impact operations. The company notes that the ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in its systems or portable media, and that it could experience business interruption, theft of confidential information, reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, either internally or at its third-party providers. Although such events have not had a material aggregate impact to date, BMS expects their frequency to continue or increase and has invested in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices of its data and information technology while continuously monitoring its systems for current or potential threats. The company further highlights that social media platforms present risks and challenges—from brand damage or information leakage to legal implications arising from improper collection or dissemination of personally identifiable or non-public company-sensitive information—and that identifying new points of entry as social media expands presents ongoing challenges. BMS relies on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to manage certain marketing, selling, human resources, finance, information technology and other business-unit and functional services, and notes that third-party failures to meet contractual, regulatory or continuity obligations, or violations of data privacy and security laws in various jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on its operations and results. Finally, the company recognizes that changes in U.S. or foreign laws and regulations—including increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement and emerging global reporting requirements for value transfers to healthcare professionals—could negatively affect its business, operating results and financial condition.

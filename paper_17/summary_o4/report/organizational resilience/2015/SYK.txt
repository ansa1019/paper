The report warns that the failure of a key information technology system, process or site and a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key IT systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers, could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. It discloses that the company relies extensively on information technology systems to conduct business—systems that encompass ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security and other processes necessary to manage the business. It further describes reliance on networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted or provided by third parties, to assist in conducting the business. The report notes that numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats, pose potential risks to the security of IT systems, networks and services and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data, and that the company has made investments to address these threats—monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers—while acknowledging the difficulty of anticipating and preventing sophisticated attacks. It warns that if IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly for any reason, and business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures in a timely manner, the company may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action, and that the costs and operational consequences of interruptions, responses to breaches and remediation measures could be significant. The report also discloses that an inability to successfully manage the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system—which will replace many existing operating and financial systems—could be disruptive and adversely affect operations and operating results, including the ability to report accurate and timely financial results. Finally, it states that capital expenditures in 2015 were primarily related to acquisition integration support, information technology infrastructure upgrades, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost savings.

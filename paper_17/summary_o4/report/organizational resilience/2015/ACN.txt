The Company is dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with its clients, alliance partners and vendors, and as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow—including through mobile technologies and social media—the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases, which could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of its systems, unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information and material adverse effects on its results of operations; in providing services and solutions to clients, the Company often manages, utilizes and stores sensitive or confidential client or Company data, including personal data, and expects these activities to increase, subjecting it to an expanding array of laws and regulations designed to protect this information; its liability insurance, which includes cyber insurance, might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches; unauthorized access to or through its information systems or those it develops for clients—whether by its employees or third parties, including computer programmers, hackers or state-sponsored organizations—could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, reputational damage and government sanctions; the Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot adapt and expand its services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants, such as digital offerings, analytics, mobility, Internet of Things, cloud-based services, everything-as-a-service solutions, security, cognitive computing and information technology automation; as a result of these rapid technology developments, clients may slow spending on current technologies in anticipation of new digital-related offerings, EAAS and IoT implementations, potentially impacting the Company’s revenues; the Company continues to experience growing demand for digital-related services and assistance with adoption of new technologies, including cloud enablement and the operation and maintenance of digital-related services; it is providing a greater proportion of systems integration consulting and application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in its global delivery network, reflecting its emphasis on mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities; its services and solutions are largely based on technology or software provided by a few major alliance partners, and market consolidation among hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers could reduce its access to products and services as clients favor integrated technology stacks, with potential adverse effects on its competitive position; it also relies on third-party software in delivering some services and solutions and agrees to indemnify clients for alleged intellectual property infringements, which could require it to incur substantial costs or substitute alternative technology if rights are unavailable.

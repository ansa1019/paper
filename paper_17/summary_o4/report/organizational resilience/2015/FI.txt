The annual report discloses that the company competes against both established rivals and its clients’ own in-house capabilities and acknowledges that if it fails to adapt its products and services to technological change or if ongoing efforts to upgrade its technology are not successful, it could lose clients or limit its growth; it notes that its markets are characterized by constant technological change, frequent introductions of new products and evolving industry standards, and that its ability to enhance existing offerings and to develop and introduce innovative products and services addressing increasingly sophisticated client needs will significantly affect future success, although it may encounter development delays, integration difficulties or market acceptance challenges. The report highlights that security breaches, malware or cyber-attacks could disrupt the integrity, continuity and trust of its systems or those of its clients, potentially requiring significant additional investment to modify and enhance information security and controls, and that operational failures in its transaction-processing businesses, including business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, software defects, development delays or installation difficulties when integrating its technology on client systems, could harm its reputation and expose it to liability. In the discussion of its business, the company describes its core technology offerings—account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, card and print personalization, and fraud and risk management tools—and explains that it pursues strategic initiatives to differentiate through innovation and integration, with enterprise priorities focused on building client relationships around digital and payment solutions and delivering integrated technology services. The report further observes that financial institutions face heightened data and transaction processing needs driven by growth in electronic transactions and digital channels, leading those institutions to invest substantial capital and human resources in transaction processing, information management and innovative service delivery, and that the company expects to benefit from a long-term trend toward outsourcing in-house technology to providers capable of achieving economies of scale in technology infrastructure, products, services and networks. The acquisition of Open Solutions, which brought in a real-time open-architecture account processing system and expanded the client base, is cited as advancing the company’s go-to-market strategy by adding technology functionality and facilitating the deployment of complementary solutions, while ongoing data center and facility consolidation activities reflect continued investment in technology infrastructure and operational effectiveness to support business needs.

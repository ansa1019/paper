Union Pacific’s risk disclosures and management discussion emphasize that the firm “relies on information technology in all aspects of our business,” noting that without sufficient capital to acquire or implement new technologies such as positive train control or the latest version of its transportation control systems it “may suffer a competitive disadvantage” affecting its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity; the company also warns that a cyber attack or other disruption of its “information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment,” could cause significant service interruptions, safety failures, security breaches or other operational difficulties; accordingly, its 2016 capital plan allocates significant investments to technology improvements—approximately $375 million for PTC—and the company includes computer software and communications equipment among the components of its “other” operating expenses that support network performance, resource coordination and overall operational efficiency.

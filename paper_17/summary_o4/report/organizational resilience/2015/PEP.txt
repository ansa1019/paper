PepsiCo’s disclosures describe a broad-ranging digital and information‐technology transformation under way across its global operations, from consumer engagement through to supply‐chain execution, even though they do not explicitly label these initiatives as “IT capability” per se.  In its “Business Strategies” section, the company stresses the need to build new capabilities by increasing its e-commerce presence, investing in research and development and design to foster “breakthrough innovations,” and enhancing consumer experiences through digital marketing, social media engagement and content creation.  Under “Productivity Initiatives,” it highlights the automation of packaging and warehousing processes, remote monitoring of production systems by engineers, the optimization of global manufacturing footprints and the expansion of shared services—implicitly relying on centralized IT systems and cloud-based platforms to support these efficiencies.  Its “Business Transformation” segment refers to a multi-year initiative to migrate core financial processing systems to enterprise-wide applications, underscoring the importance of a robust information technology infrastructure.  In discussing risks, PepsiCo details its dependence on information technology—including public websites, cloud-based services and third-party–managed networks—for functions ranging from order and materials management, financial reporting, regulatory compliance, data collection and storage, to secure, global electronic communication among affiliates, employees, bottlers and distributors.  The company also identifies cybersecurity threats and the need to allocate resources for network monitoring, security policy upgrades and vendor controls, as well as reliance on shared‐services IT support and cloud‐based administrative functions.  Throughout the 10-K, management refers to digital‐channel metrics such as media viewership and engagement, and to tools for maintaining financial accuracy and efficiency—indicating an evolving scope of IT resources and capabilities deployed to coordinate assets, processes and interfirm relationships and to support strategic objectives across the value chain.

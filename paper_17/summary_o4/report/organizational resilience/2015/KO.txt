The company relies extensively on networks and information systems and other technology services, including the internet and third‐party hosting, to support core business processes such as procurement and supply chain management, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and payment collection, mergers and acquisitions, research and development, financial reporting, regulatory compliance, digital marketing and worldwide electronic communications among its locations, bottling partners, customers, suppliers and consumers. Because these information systems are critical to many of the company’s operating activities, the business can be materially impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches arising from routine operations such as system upgrades or user errors, network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks of various origins, geopolitical events, natural disasters, telecommunications failures or other catastrophic events. Such incidents may result in unauthorized disclosure or falsification of material confidential information, violations of data privacy laws and regulations, damage to the company’s reputation and credibility, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest businesses or brands, inability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts, and delays in financial reporting or disruptions to manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and payment processes, any of which could reduce revenues and profits. To address these risks, the company has continued to make investments in personnel, technology, cyber insurance and training, and it maintains an information risk management program supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross‐functional committee, with regular reports on emerging risks and mitigation plans delivered to senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors.

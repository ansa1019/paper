The report underscores the critical role of digital infrastructure and information‐processing capabilities in supporting virtually all aspects of the firm’s business, noting our reliance on complex operational and security systems – computer, database and e-mail platforms, telecommunications networks, back-up systems and other safeguards – to process transactions, manage data, aggregate risk information and deliver services through retail, online and mobile-banking channels.  It describes ongoing investments in technology to “continuously update systems to support our operations and growth,” facilitate intraday monitoring, reporting and control of market, credit, liquidity and operational risks, and to enable the execution of hedging, pricing and model-based valuations (for mortgage servicing rights and property valuations via automated valuation models) in a timely, reliable and secure manner.  The text highlights the importance of coordinating IT-based resources with other organizational assets to enhance information accuracy, timeliness, confidentiality and connectivity, to support key business strategies – from treasury and trading activities to consumer and commercial lending – and to respond to external influences such as rapid shifts in market dynamics, regulatory requirements, customer preferences and cybersecurity threats, all of which call for agile deployment, reconfiguration and governance of digital technologies and data management practices.

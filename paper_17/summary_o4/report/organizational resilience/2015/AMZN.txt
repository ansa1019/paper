Our rapid global expansion has significantly increased the complexity of our IT infrastructure and systems, placing substantial strain on management, personnel, operations, systems performance, financial resources, and internal controls and requiring ongoing investments to scale, upgrade, and optimize software, hardware, network capacity, data centers, and fulfillment‐center systems; the timing, effectiveness, and cost of these system and infrastructure expansions and upgrades are critical to supporting our e-commerce operations, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content delivery, and AWS offerings, and failure to add requisite capacity or to maintain adequate redundancy and disaster-recovery planning could result in system interruptions or delays, service disruptions, increased costs, impaired customer experience, or liability claims. We rely on a shared technology infrastructure to provide global compute, storage, database, and other cloud services, while internally using third-party encryption, authentication, employee e-mail, content delivery, back-office support, and other functions, and our business is subject to risks of data loss or security breaches—including spyware, viruses, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, and vendor vulnerabilities—that could compromise data confidentiality, integrity, and availability, harm our reputation, lead to litigation or regulatory actions, and otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, introducing new products, services, and technologies often presents difficult technology challenges in integrating hardware, software, and supplier commitments, and any failure to optimally design, deploy, or secure these IT resources across diverse geographies and business lines may undermine our operational flexibility, responsiveness to market dynamics, and ability to leverage IT capabilities as a strategic resource for competitive advantage.

The Company discloses that it relies extensively on information technology systems, some managed or provided by third-party service providers, “to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data,” and that it “also rely[s] heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data in managing [its] business.”  It acknowledges that these systems and processes must be periodically maintained and updated, and are “subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes” including hardware, software or application defects, cyber-attacks, security breaches, design or usage errors by associates or vendors, and catastrophic events, any of which could disrupt operations and be costly and resource-intensive to remedy.  The Company has implemented and regularly reviews and updates processes and procedures “to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss,” and has completed a major payment security project providing enhanced encryption at the point of sale and rolled out EMV chip card technology.  Digital and multichannel initiatives include use of web-enabled handheld devices (“second generation first phones”) to convert online sales in-aisle and expedite checkout, programs such as BOSS, BOPIS and direct or BODFS fulfillment, pilot and planned roll-out of COM (customer order management system) across U.S. stores by end of fiscal 2016, enhancements to online properties and mobile experience, and investment in digital content—all designed to “provide an improved overall shopping and multichannel experience,” drive traffic, improve conversion rates, increase online sales (up 25.4% in fiscal 2015), and support “our interconnected retail strategy.”  The Company further describes significant supply-chain and technology investments, including Project Sync, to “streamline our operations,” reduce lead times, improve inventory turns and transportation efficiency, and interconnect distribution networks via RDC delivery.  It also notes that disruption of customer-facing technology systems could impair its strategy and negatively affect customer experience and that evolving regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, data collection and privacy could materially increase costs and impact how the Company operates its systems and uses customer information.

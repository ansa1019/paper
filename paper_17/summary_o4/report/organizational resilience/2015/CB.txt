We have disclosed a substantial exposure to losses resulting from man-made catastrophes, including significant cyber-attacks, with the incidence and severity of such events inherently unpredictable and historical experience not necessarily representative of contemporary exposures and risks. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information and assets within our computer systems and networks and those of third-party service providers, and our business depends on effective information security and systems and the integrity, timeliness and availability of the data our information systems use to run our business, including to price products and services, establish reserves, provide efficient and secure customer service, value investments and report financial results. In an effort to ensure data integrity, we implement and continually upgrade administrative and technical controls, new security measures and systems (including confidential intellectual property) and negotiate protective agreements with third-party providers, although such measures may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access, computer viruses, malware or other malicious code or cyber-attack, catastrophic events, system failures and disruptions, employee or third-party errors or malfeasance, or other security events that may not be immediately detected. As the breadth and complexity of our security infrastructure grows, the potential risk of a security event increases, and an event could jeopardize confidential information, interrupt or delay our operations or those of our clients or counterparties, or result in data or asset loss, leading to significant financial losses, reputational harm and adverse effects on critical business functions. In response we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify protective measures, investigate and remediate vulnerabilities and recover lost data or assets, and we may face litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and criminal prosecution under an increasingly demanding and complex regulatory environment governing information security and privacy in multiple jurisdictions. Our ability to conduct business may also be adversely affected by disruptions to the infrastructure that supports our operations or outsourced services, including electrical, communications, transportation or other system failures, and our contingency plans may not fully mitigate such events. Moreover, we employ analytical models and data analytics to assist decision-making in key areas such as underwriting, claims, reserving and catastrophe risk management in order to maintain competitive advantage, but those models are subject to assumptions, uncertainties, inherent limitations and potential input errors that could result in mispricing or underestimation of risk, with adverse impacts on our business and financial performance. We may additionally face challenges in adapting our information technology to comply with new regulatory requirements in particular jurisdictions if our systems cannot be quickly adjusted to address changes in oversight or laws.

The company discloses that it continues to invest heavily in its IT capability through “substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure,” including purchases of cloud-based infrastructure hardware equipment and expansion of co-located third-party facilities, to support anticipated growth and host its subscription services. It emphasizes that subscription revenues are generated by “fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and upgrades” and that cost of subscription revenues reflects “data center capacity costs,” depreciation of dedicated infrastructure and personnel costs “directly associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and customer support.” The firm provides “regular updates to our services,” yet acknowledges that these “frequently contain undetected defects when first introduced,” that “defects may also be introduced by our use of third-party software,” and that “errors we make in delivering, configuring, or hosting our services, or designing, installing, expanding or maintaining our cloud infrastructure” could cause service disruptions. It warns that such interruptions could damage its customers’ businesses, harm its reputation and financial results, and that data centers “are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss and similar events” or to “break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism” and that it “cannot rapidly switch to new data centers or move customers” in the event of an adverse event. The report identifies the ongoing evolution of business competition in “fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive” markets, notes competition from “in-house solutions, large integrated systems vendors, and established and emerging cloud and software vendors,” and warns that competitors “may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards and customer requirements.” As the company expands into IT operations management, customer service, security incident management and service management outside of enterprise IT, it faces “increasing competition from platform vendors and from application development vendors.” The firm further recognizes the imperative to deliver a “consumer-like technology experience” by continually modifying and improving its user interfaces, mobility, messaging, social networking, database, hardware and security technologies to meet evolving user expectations. It acknowledges that cyber-security threats are growing more sophisticated—“computer malware, viruses and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties have become more prevalent”—and that it may need “significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure,” while noting that its current security measures “may be breached” and that it lacks sufficient insurance to compensate for potential losses. Throughout, the disclosures underscore the centrality of acquiring, deploying, combining and reconfiguring IT resources in support of business strategies, operational flexibility and competitive advantage, as well as the importance of skilled personnel, process optimization and partner coordination to leverage IT capability alongside other organizational resources and achieve long-term growth and firm performance.

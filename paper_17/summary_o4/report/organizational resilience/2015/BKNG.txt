Throughout our Risk Factors and Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we disclose that our business depends critically on a wide array of information technology resources and the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy and integrate these to support and enhance our travel reservation platforms. We rely on third-party online advertising channels—primarily search engines such as Google, meta-search services and affiliate networks—to generate the vast majority of our website traffic, and warn that changes in search algorithms or auction‐based placement or the manner in which travel services are presented may materially impede our customer acquisition and competitive positioning. We purchase traffic under pay-per-click arrangements that can be terminated with little notice, rely on third-party computer systems and global distribution and central reservation systems of accommodation, rental car and airline industries, and depend on our marketing affiliates and mobile carriers for distribution and connectivity, any interruption or deterioration of which could substantially disrupt our booking services. We have experienced and remain vulnerable to internal or external security breaches—through phishing, SQL injection, denial-of-service or other forms of cyber-attack—which may compromise consumer data despite our encryption, authentication technologies, redundancy and hosted data-center capacity, leading to service outages, negative publicity and regulatory exposure. Our mobile strategy and investments in mobile-optimized websites and apps are driven by the rapid shift to smart phones and tablets, yet advertising and distribution opportunities on these devices are constrained by screen size and evolving platform rules, and device makers such as Apple and Google may leverage their operating systems and app stores to favor their own travel offerings. We also incur significant software license and system maintenance fees, data communications and outsourced data-center costs, and capitalize internally developed software and hardware—including servers, network equipment and office build-outs—to scale our infrastructure, and we use both internally developed and third-party systems for transaction processing, order management and financial reporting that must be continually upgraded to accommodate growth and geographic expansion. These factors collectively underscore the necessity of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources—ranging from technology infrastructure, software development, data management and security controls to managerial capabilities and process integration—to maintain operational flexibility, ensure information timeliness, reliability and confidentiality, optimize processes and preserve our competitive advantage in an intensely dynamic global market.

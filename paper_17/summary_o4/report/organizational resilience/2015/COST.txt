The company discloses that it relies extensively on business-critical computer systems and back-up systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage operations and that maintaining uninterrupted operation of these systems is crucial given the very high transaction volumes processed each year. It warns that failure to adequately update or secure these systems, or disruptions due to power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events or human error, could materially harm the business and require significant investments to repair or replace systems, causing operational interruptions. The company is undertaking significant technology investments to improve or replace its information processes and systems, including information systems modernization projects that are increasing depreciation and service contract costs, and it emphasizes that selecting, monitoring and pacing these investments and applying a rigorous change management process are key to realizing benefits and avoiding competitive erosion, cost overruns or implementation delays. In support of its evolving multichannel strategy, the company is investing in its websites and mobile applications, and its online business depends on the secure transmission of encrypted confidential member information over public networks and on third-party business associates, including cloud service providers. It further notes that compliance with changing privacy and information security laws and regulations may require additional system changes and administrative processes, and that any data security breach could damage reputation, incur litigation or regulatory penalties, and disrupt operations. Finally, the company acknowledges payment-processing risks associated with both internally maintained systems and third-party providers, including the potential liability and loss of payment card acceptance rights if its systems are breached.

The company discloses that it relies heavily on its financial, accounting and other data processing systems and that any failure or disabling of these systems could cause financial loss, business disruption, liability to its funds, regulatory intervention or reputational harm. It emphasizes that its businesses and portfolio companies are highly dependent on information systems and technology for critical functions such as transaction execution, confirmation and settlement, and for accurate recording, evaluation and accounting of trades. The company warns that its information systems may not continue to accommodate growth, support new products or strategies, or resist security threats and that the cost of maintaining and scaling such systems could increase materially. It further acknowledges ongoing cyber security threats intended to gain unauthorized access to proprietary information, destroy or degrade data and disable systems, and notes that these risks may not be fully insured or indemnified. The firm also depends on third-party service providers for hosting, technology, administration, tax and compliance, and any interruption or deterioration in their performance could impair operations, damage its reputation and limit growth. Similarly, its portfolio companies rely on data processing systems for secure storage and transmission of confidential payment and health information, and a breach or disruption of those systems could materially diminish the value of those businesses. Moreover, the company recognizes that its business-continuity and disaster-recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm from a disaster or infrastructure failure.

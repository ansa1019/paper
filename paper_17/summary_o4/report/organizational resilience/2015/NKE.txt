The Company’s risk factors highlight difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining its increasingly complex information systems and controls, including systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control, and interruptions in data and information technology systems that expose it to consumer data security and privacy risks; it warns that any failure of the technology-based systems that underpin its e-commerce platform—comprising its websites, mobile commerce applications and social-media integrations—and its inability to provide reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms with rapid delivery options and continual alignment to changing online shopper expectations could materially impair global e-commerce growth, harm its reputation and place it at a competitive disadvantage; it also acknowledges its heavy dependence on information technology systems and networks (including third-party hosted services) across its supply chain, retail operations and financial reporting and the critical importance of robust business continuity plans to address security breaches, viruses, hackers or other disruptions that could result in lost or compromised business data and personal information, lost sales, fines or litigation; in Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the Company describes substantial investments in new technologies to increase automation, reduce waste, enhance customization and speed to market, as well as ongoing commitments to information systems, digital capabilities, infrastructure and analytics to support the expansion of direct-to-consumer stores, digital marketing, digital commerce, supply chain optimization and broader operational efficiency.

Amgen states that its operations are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data security, with the multitude and complexity of its computer systems and the potential value of its data making them inherently vulnerable to service interruptions or destruction, malicious intrusions and random attacks; it acknowledges that data privacy or security breaches by employees or others could expose sensitive information—including intellectual property, trade secrets and personal data of the company, its patients, customers and partners—to unauthorized persons or the public, observes that its global systems are subject to frequent, sophisticated cyber-attacks by nation-states, organized crime groups and “hacktivists,” and notes that although past intrusions have not materially affected its operations, it continues to invest heavily in protecting its critical or sensitive data and information technology without assurance that such measures will prevent or detect future breaches, any of which could inflict financial, legal, business or reputational harm.

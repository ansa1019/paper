Our annual report warns that customers’ expectations about how they research, purchase and receive products and services have evolved in a rapidly changing omni-channel retailing environment, necessitating the delivery of customer-facing technology systems that appeal to our customers, function as designed and provide a consistent experience across devices and channels; meeting these expectations requires large, complex programs of integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing and new competencies for our management, employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities, and failure to do so may prevent us from realizing the full benefits of our strategic omni-channel initiatives. We acknowledge that our business performance and reputation could be adversely affected by our or our third-party service providers’ failure to adequately anticipate or prevent a cyber-attack or other breach of mission-critical systems that exploits evolving security vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized release of sensitive customer, employee, vendor or company information and leading to financial losses, regulatory fines, litigation and increased data protection costs. We accept multiple payment methods that expose us to numerous compliance requirements, fraud risk and reliance on external payment processors, and if we fail to comply with payment card association operating rules or payment card industry data security standards, or if our data security systems are compromised, we may be liable for banks’ costs, fines or higher transaction fees and risk losing the ability to accept electronic payments. As customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omni-channel sales and marketing strategy, performance issues or outages, including those caused by distributed denial of service or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure without a rapid disaster-recovery plan, could destroy the benefits of these systems and harm customers’ perceptions of our reliability as an online vendor. In management’s discussion of operations and capital resources, we highlight that an important part of our omni-channel efforts requires us to invest in, maintain and make ongoing improvements to our management information systems that support operations such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment, and note that these systems are subject to damage or interruption from catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks or telecommunications failures and require continued investment to maintain, improve, upgrade and expand. We also identify risks in our strategic transactions that failure to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully or to maintain effective internal controls could create complexity in our financial systems, hinder our reporting obligations and prevent us from realizing anticipated synergies.

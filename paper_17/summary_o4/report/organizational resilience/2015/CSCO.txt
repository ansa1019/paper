Cisco describes a strategic evolution from standalone networking products to integrated architectures and solutions that leverage the network as a platform to connect, secure and automate distributed data and assets, thereby enhancing its IT capability to support customers’ digital transitions.  The company emphasizes the convergence of computing, networking, storage access and virtualization in its unified computing system and enterprise data‐center platforms, the shift toward programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and investments in cloud and intercloud solutions and Internet of Everything (IoE) initiatives.  It highlights the mobilization and reconfiguration of IT‐based resources—including technology, knowledge, processes and human capital—together with aligned investments in engineering, sales, services and support to drive business innovation, operational efficiency and competitive advantage.  Recurring revenue models such as subscription software, advanced services and everything‐as‐a‐service (XaaS) illustrate Cisco’s commitment to information management capabilities that deliver accurate, timely, reliable and secure data access.  Success in these transitions depends on effective product planning, timely technology deployment, coordinated resource allocation, anticipation of evolving customer needs and technology trends, and the ability to adapt organizational structures and processes to sustain leadership in routing, switching, security and services.

The company recognizes “internet connectivity, access to our supercharger network, and future over-the-air software updates” as distinct deliverables valued on a stand-alone basis and amortized over the eight-year life of its vehicles, highlighting the strategic role of digital technologies and information management in its offerings. It is currently expanding and improving its information technology systems—including internally developed product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, and financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems—to support and optimize its business processes, and it classifies a material portion of its selling, general and administrative expenses as office, information technology and facilities-related costs. These core systems underlie the coordination of its assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions, and the company cautions that any failure to effectively implement, maintain or scale these systems could disrupt operations, impair the accuracy and timeliness of financial reporting, compromise proprietary information, give rise to internal control deficiencies and require substantial remediation resources. To safeguard these systems and customer data, it maintains information-technology-based security measures to protect against system security risks, data breaches and cyber-attacks, yet it acknowledges potential vulnerabilities in its vehicles’ built-in connectivity and remote update features that could permit unauthorized access or manipulation of functionality. Moreover, the vehicles’ inherent software complexity—exemplified by the 17-inch display screen, autopilot hardware and over-the-air update capability—demonstrates the importance of mobilizing IT resources in combination with manufacturing and service capabilities to deliver reliable, timely and secure product performance.

The “Risk Factors” section discloses that the company has “experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results will be adversely affected,” and explains that “to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.” It warns that it “may not be able to successfully scale improvements to our enterprise resource planning system or implement or scale improvements to our other systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our operating results,” and that “we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software, which could disrupt existing customer relationships, cause us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our products, or increase our technical support costs.” The company further cautions that “our failure to improve our systems, processes, and controls, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings, or to prevent certain losses,” and discloses that “we are implementing certain new enterprise management systems and any failure to implement these systems may disrupt our operations and our operating expenses could increase.” It notes that “our productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively,” that “any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout our organization,” and that “failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, negatively impact our end-customers’ satisfaction with our products and services, and harm our operating results.” The company also highlights its reliance on “our systems related to order review and processing,” the interoperability of “our products with our end-customers’ infrastructure,” and third-party channel partners and manufacturers to fulfill orders, and cautions that “if functionality similar to that offered by our products is incorporated into existing network infrastructure products, organizations may decide against adding our appliances to their network,” underscoring the need to continually evolve its IT-based resources to remain competitive.

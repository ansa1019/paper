The company acknowledges that the process of developing new high‚Äêtechnology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and uncertain and requires long-term investments in core technologies, infrastructure and intellectual property before customer demand can be accurately gauged; it must continually adapt its solutions to new devices, operating systems and emerging digital application marketplaces, extend its core technology into new applications and anticipate evolving industry standards, software delivery methods and business models to maintain market acceptance and competitive positioning. The shift to cloud-based subscription and hosted services, such as Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Marketing Cloud, has necessitated substantial investment in network infrastructure, data centers and service operations, including systems that process high transaction volumes, deliver data in near-real time and ensure accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality and connectivity to users worldwide. The company maintains strategic relationships with third parties for hosting, content delivery and open-source initiatives, but recognizes that many critical applications reside in single data centers and that contractual or technological constraints may limit redundancy, scalability, disaster recovery and geographic reach, which could impede its ability to support business needs and deliver performance gains. In addition, the company devotes significant resources to address cybersecurity threats, security vulnerabilities, data loss, unauthorized access and compliance with privacy and regulatory requirements through secure engineering, code hardening, penetration testing, incident response enhancements and governance practices; it warns that failures in its network infrastructure, enterprise applications or third-party service providers could disrupt order processing, data collection, reporting, customer relationships and financial results, and that its ability to effectively deploy, combine and reconfigure its IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes is critical to transforming the firm into a sustainable competitive force.

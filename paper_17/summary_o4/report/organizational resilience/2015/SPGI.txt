We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings and acknowledge that unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems could materially disrupt our business, financial condition or results of operations. We depend on network systems and the Internet to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data electronically, and our ability to deliver products and services may be impaired by infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party Internet providers or heightened regulation. Although we maintain policies, processes and internal controls designed to ensure IT stability, information security, confidentiality and business continuity, our systems are not always fully redundant and our disaster recovery plans may not always be sufficient or effective; as a result, a local or regional disaster, cyber-attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt operations and result in significant financial loss, reputational harm, regulatory actions or legal liability. We outsource certain support functions to third-party service providers to achieve cost efficiencies and access specialized capabilities, but we have limited control over their performance and any failure by these providers to perform effectively could lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies or harm to employee morale. Our ability to produce and develop products also depends on third-party data, software and service suppliers, and delays, errors, design defects, unavailability or termination of such arrangements could materially and adversely affect us. We make significant investments in information-technology data centers and other technology initiatives but cannot assure that such investments will yield increased revenues. Finally, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other information in our computer systems, networks and those of our vendors, and material cybersecurity incidents could cause operational disruptions, reputational damage, loss of customers, regulatory sanctions, litigation or uninsured financial losses.

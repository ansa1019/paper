Netflix has expanded and scaled its streaming service through the development and deployment of proprietary and third-party technology, including the use of cloud computing services, its own communications and computer hardware systems, and a global content-delivery network to support high-volume streaming over the internet; the company has architected its software and computer systems around Amazon Web Services for data processing and storage and leverages both in-house recommendation and merchandising algorithms and third-party solutions to market its service, process payments, and manage daily operations. Netflix’s reliance on external device partnerships, internet service providers, and network operator interconnection underscores the strategic importance of connectivity, broadband availability, and net neutrality regulations to ensure non-discriminatory, efficient, and reliable content delivery. Any disruption, failure, or unauthorized access to Netflix’s computer systems, including cyber-attacks, software errors, or third-party infrastructure outages, could degrade service performance, impair information security and data management processes, disrupt customer relationship systems, and adversely affect membership acquisition, retention, and overall firm performance. Privacy and data protection measures, such as licensed encryption and authentication technologies for billing and personal data, are integral to Netflix’s information management capabilities, and evolving regulatory requirements regarding data utilization, localization, and export could impact its business model and IT governance frameworks. Netflix’s ongoing investments in IT resources—including cloud computing, content infrastructure, cybersecurity, and algorithmic recommendation systems—are essential to maintain operational flexibility, support international expansion, drive service innovation, and sustain competitive advantage in a dynamic global market.

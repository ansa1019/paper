We manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations and also process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information; unauthorized users may be able to gain access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns, develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities, resulting in significant losses, damage to our reputation, or litigation if confidential information is compromised. We continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations in multiple locations in several countries and to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, research and development, and product and process technology. We have entered into strategic relationships and joint ventures to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products, which involve coordination of technology transfer, operations services, and interfirm transactions, yet our control over joint venture operations is limited and we may experience difficulties in transferring technology, ramping production, and aligning strategic corporate decisions with our partners. Our inotera supply agreements, under which we have purchased all of inotera’s DRAM output at negotiated discounts since January 2013 and will do so under a margin‐sharing formula beginning in 2016, reflect resource integration and coordination of production capacity but also pose risks related to technology transfer, production ramp, capital expenditure alignment, and supply cost competitiveness. In order to optimize operations, improve efficiency, and increase our focus on our core memory operations, we have entered into various restructuring activities, including the wind-down of legacy facilities and workforce optimization, designed to improve process performance, support strategic resource allocation, and enhance organizational effectiveness. We share with Intel the costs of product design and process development activities for NAND flash memory and 3D XPoint memory, reflecting a collaborative approach to technology investment and leveraging of joint development resources. Our critical accounting estimates require judgment and assumptions to project future average selling prices, sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, and costs to complete work in process, which affect the valuation of inventories, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets; determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity requires assessment of our power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance and our rights to absorb losses or receive benefits; and accounting for acquisitions and restructuring of joint ventures involves fair-value measurements of technology assets, deferred tax assets, and debt obligations.

We rely heavily on information technology (“IT”) systems as an important part of our internal controls to operate, transact and otherwise manage our business and to provide effective and timely reporting of our financial results, and each year we are required to document, test and report on the effectiveness of those IT controls under Section 404; we are also in the process of transferring our customer billing systems to a new third-party vendor via a phased deployment approach, with parallel operation of the existing and new platforms during the conversion, and any unanticipated difficulties, disruptions or delays in that implementation—or errors, cyber-attacks or other operational failures by the vendor—could adversely affect our ability to provide or bill for services, retain or attract customers and maintain overall customer experience. Our reputation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by system failures, business disruptions or unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems, and we rely upon our systems and networks, and those of other providers and suppliers, to provide and support our services and, in some cases, to protect our customers’ and our information; failure of our or others’ systems, networks or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow unauthorized access to confidential or proprietary information. We depend heavily on suppliers and other third parties to develop, maintain and troubleshoot products and services such as network components, software development services and billing and customer care support, and if our efforts or those of our third-party service providers to maintain the privacy and security of customer, confidential or sensitive information are not successful at preventing a significant data breach or cyber-attack, we could incur substantial additional costs, become subject to litigation or regulatory investigation and suffer reputational damage. Examples of these risks include physical or equipment failures, human error, theft of proprietary information or unauthorized access to our information technology, billing, customer care and provisioning systems and networks.

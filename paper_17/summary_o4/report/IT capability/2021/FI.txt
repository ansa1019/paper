The Company discloses that it has implemented and periodically tests business continuity and disaster recovery plans designed to “stand-ready” to provide client-facing services, recover critical business functions, assets and data, and preserve contractual performance in the face of disruptions such as natural disasters, pandemics, power losses, cyberattacks and other operational failures.  It acknowledges that failures of its processing systems, third-party providers or the interconnected global financial network may interrupt the availability of products and services, impair its ability to transmit information and move funds, and expose it to increased liability, reputational harm or regulatory sanctions.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has adapted its operating parameters by restricting travel, limiting non-essential visitors, enforcing social-distancing and vaccination policies, disinfecting facilities and providing personal protective equipment, while noting that these measures may affect productivity and may not fully mitigate health-related pressures on its employees, clients, vendors, supply chain and operations.  The Company also monitors global supply chain constraints, invests in information security and controls to counter evolving technological risks, and maintains financial resources, credit facilities and securitized receivables to ensure liquidity under adverse conditions.  It further identifies risk mitigation efforts including fraud prevention programs, credit-risk management, portfolio rebalancing and targeted capital allocation to sustain operations, support service innovation and enhance system integrity and resilience against external and internal variations.

Throughout the Form 10-K, Nike identifies health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, as risk factors that have caused and may cause “business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas,” “significant disruption in the financial markets,” deterioration in economic conditions, reduced consumer demand, cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and decreased retail traffic, and acknowledges the inability to predict the pandemic’s duration or impact on future revenues, operations or financial condition. The company warns of “operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, as a result of continued workforce remote work arrangements,” and that disruptions to distribution centers, third-party manufacturing partners and other vendors—through facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages and changes in operating procedures—could adversely affect its ability to meet consumer demand. It further highlights risks from bankruptcies or other financial difficulties of wholesale customers and the potential inability to forecast or sustain growth and inventories. Nike explicitly references “business continuity event” risk, noting that “disaster recovery and business continuity planning” and its diversity of locations, operational size and information technology systems “position us well, but may not be sufficient” to address local or regional disasters or concurrent eventualities, where loss of personnel, functional failure of computer, network, telecommunication and other systems or inability to repair damage could cause “operational challenges,” delays in delivery or inability to deliver products, “reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns.” It also addresses climate change and natural disasters—including energy shortages, public health issues, earthquakes, hurricanes and wildfires—as extreme conditions that may disrupt operations, distribution facilities and retail traffic and drive regulatory or consumer preference changes. In its Management’s Discussion, Nike describes its strategic response to these pressures through a digitally-empowered phase of the “consumer direct offense” focused on increasing its speed and agility to market, leveraging its digital platforms and store footprint, and “unifying investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation” to accelerate digital transformation, enhance operational flexibility and positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company also cites its central foreign exchange risk management program, business interruption insurance, significant investments in information technology and digital commerce platforms, strategic reinvestment in higher-margin channels and digital connectivity, and ongoing monitoring of global health and regulatory guidance as resilience mechanisms intended to sustain continuity, adaptability and performance in the face of disruptions, environmental perturbations and evolving market volatility.

The company acknowledges susceptibility to macroeconomic downturns, geopolitical tensions and the volatility of general market conditions and has modified, and may further modify, its business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social ramifications across its global operations to preserve continuity of operations. It notes that constrained supply or volatility in customer demand—stemming from internal or external pressures such as pandemics, natural events, trade restrictions, currency fluctuations and cybersecurity breaches—could materially affect its performance, and it monitors evolving factors including the duration and scope of such events, governmental, social and business actions, and their impact on short- and long-term economic conditions. Manufacturing forecasts are based on multiple assumptions to balance inventory and production capacity, and failure to match production with changing product mix needs could reduce margins and impair results, while lead time extensions and supplier credit constraints may challenge its ability to obtain critical materials, services, utilities and advanced process technologies. The company faces severe weather, geological events, climate change risks and other disruptions that may disrupt principal manufacturing and design facilities, and it continues to invest in manufacturing capacity, research and development and strategic, business and organizational changes—including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions—to strengthen its competitive advantages and improve operational flexibility and resilience. It maintains diverse financing sources, including cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and an undrawn revolving credit facility, and believes it has the necessary resources and operating plans to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments for at least the next 12 months. Rapid technological change, intense competition and regulatory complexity require rapid response, disciplined resource allocation and efficiency improvements, while evolving cybersecurity threats prompt increased protection, remediation and risk mitigation measures to defend information technology networks and manufacturing operations. The MD&A emphasizes discipline in capital allocation to grow long-term free cash flow per share and continued caution and monitoring of market conditions to enable positive adjustment under challenging conditions and support long-term performance.

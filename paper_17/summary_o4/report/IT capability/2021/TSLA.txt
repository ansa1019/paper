In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide, instituted employee furloughs and compensation reductions and scaled back U.S. operations, also encountering temporary impediments to administrative activities that hampered product deliveries and deployments. We have continued to monitor fluctuating infection rates and regulations across regions to remain flexible, optimize and evolve our business, accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements and deploy production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Pandemic-related issues such as port congestion, intermittent supplier shutdowns and costly semiconductor shortages have challenged our supply chain and production, prompting us to expedite deliveries of critical parts, employ alternative components and programmed software workarounds, while recognizing no guarantee of sustainability as we scale production. Sustaining our production trajectory and meeting our objectives for high-volume mass-market vehicle manufacturing requires the ongoing readiness and solvency of suppliers, stable and motivated production workforces, government cooperation, the prompt resolution of bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges, and the continuous improvement of efficient manufacturing capabilities, processes and cost structures. We have deployed multiple delivery models, including home and workplace drops and touchless deliveries, to enhance business continuity and adapt to customer needs, although the scalability and acceptance of these models globally remains uncertain. In parallel, we continue to ramp production, build new manufacturing capacity at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, expand our operations and localize procurement, all subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations across geographies. We likewise remain committed to growing our energy generation and storage business by deploying Megapack, Powerwall and solar products, improving installation capabilities, maintaining adequate battery cell supply and hiring additional skilled personnel. Recognizing that our expansion plans are capital-intensive and subject to fluctuating cash flows, we adjust our capital and operating expenditures by segment, monitor macroeconomic conditions and, as needed, seek alternative financing sources to ensure sufficient liquidity. Finally, when pandemic-related executive orders temporarily suspended operations at Gigafactory New York, we secured a deferral of our compliance obligations through December 31, 2021 under an amended agreement, demonstrating our capacity to reconstitute operational trajectories and manage evolving regulatory requirements while preserving our long-term production and investment objectives.

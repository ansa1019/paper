The company discloses that it has experienced and expects to continue to experience disruptions to its business operations and practices due to the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic and resulting public health measures, including quarantine, travel bans and work-from-home arrangements, which may limit employees’ ability to meet product schedules, roadmaps and customer commitments and could reduce overall workforce productivity; it adjusts its supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands, maintains a stable supply of materials through long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements, and relies on third-party wafer foundries (TSMC and GlobalFoundries) and ATMP joint ventures with Tongfu Microelectronics to absorb capacity constraints while amending wafer supply agreements to secure minimum annual capacity allocations through 2025; it outsources key logistics functions to third-party providers for product distribution, transportation management and IT support, acknowledging that interruptions or failures in these processes could materially disrupt its manufacturing and distribution; it relies on a number of internal business processes and information systems that must be scalable, secure and continuously upgraded to support growth, and recognizes that cyber-attacks, IT outages, data breaches, natural disasters or other disruptions beyond its control could compromise proprietary information, damage reputation and interrupt critical operations; it employs risk assessment and mitigation strategies including diversification of suppliers, hedging foreign currency exposures, contractual protections for intellectual property, compliance with environmental, export and trade regulations, and maintenance of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments—together with a revolving credit facility—to ensure sufficient liquidity for operations and strategic investments over the next twelve months and beyond; it monitors global economic and market uncertainty, customer cash-flow constraints and potential loss of significant customers, and allocates resources to research and development, marketing and product introductions in response to semiconductor cyclicality and competitive pressures; it pursues strategic initiatives such as a $4 billion stock repurchase program and the planned acquisition of Xilinx—while acknowledging that merger pendency may divert management attention, disrupt employee and partner relationships, and expose the combined company to integration challenges, regulatory conditions and goodwill impairment risks—so as to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions and position the organization to emerge stronger from adverse events.

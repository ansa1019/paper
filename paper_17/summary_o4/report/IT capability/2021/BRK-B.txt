Berkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries have implemented business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate operational risks arising from cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or other disruptions that could impair human resources, production facilities and information systems.  The company manages its operating businesses on a highly decentralized basis with few centralized functions, relying on qualified and competent managers in each operating subsidiary to direct day-to-day activities and to manage changes in future business operations due to evolving economic, regulatory and technological environments.  This decentralized model, together with a board-approved succession plan and diversified senior management participation in capital allocation and investment activities, preserves organizational strength and continuity when key personnel become unavailable.  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including mandated closures and supply-chain and workforce disruptions, many of Berkshireâ€™s businesses demonstrated adaptability by achieving significant recoveries in revenues and earnings in the second half of 2020 and into 2021, in some cases exceeding pre-pandemic levels.  Its railroad and utilities and energy businesses maintain resilience through significant ongoing capital investments to improve and maintain infrastructure, thereby ensuring safe, reliable and timely service under extreme conditions and environmental perturbations.  In its insurance operations, Berkshire employs disciplined underwriting practices, adjusts reserves for prior-year catastrophic events and continuously monitors risk exposure, while senior corporate management retains ultimate responsibility for strategic capital deployment and investment decisions to absorb market volatility and preserve or improve functioning in the face of adversity.

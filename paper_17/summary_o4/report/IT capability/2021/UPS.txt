In its annual report, UPS acknowledges that its business, financial condition and results of operations are exposed to a range of risks and uncertainties—such as the ongoing and unpredictable impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, rapid economic cyclicality across over 220 countries and territories, evolving competitive pressures, severe weather and other natural or man-made disasters, cybersecurity breaches, regulatory and legislative changes, fuel and energy price volatility, currency and interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical conflicts—that could interrupt operational continuity or impair performance. To maintain positive adjustment under these challenging conditions and preserve or improve functioning, the company has pursued a comprehensive resilience framework encompassing flexible workforce strategies (including remote work arrangements, attraction and retention of talent, and collective bargaining adjustments), dynamic resource allocation and capital management (leveraging disciplined cash flow generation, commercial paper programs, strategic debt issuances and refinancing, fuel surcharges indexed to DOE energy prices, and hedging of exchange and interest rate exposures), periodic refinement of cost allocation methodologies (such as aligning aircraft engine maintenance expense to utilization by segment), reconfiguration of the organizational portfolio through divestitures (UPS Freight) and targeted acquisitions (Roadie), and ongoing investments in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management, and disaster recovery plans. Under its ‘customer first, people led, innovation driven’ transformation, UPS utilizes automation, advanced data networks, self-insurance and actuarial reserve modeling to anticipate and mitigate hazards, sustain network integrity, deliver service innovation, and adapt operations in real time—thereby reinforcing its capability to confront disruptive events, maintain system resilience, and support long-term growth.

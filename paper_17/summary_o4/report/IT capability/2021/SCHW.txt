Schwab maintains an enterprise‐wide risk management framework encompassing operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks, with governance by senior management and the board to support business continuity and financial strength under normal and stressed scenarios. The firm conducts regular liquidity and capital stress tests, maintains backup and recovery infrastructure, routinely tests disaster recovery and incident management plans, and enforces a comprehensive information security program with advanced monitoring, employee training, and third-party risk controls. Schwab actively manages its balance sheet composition—investment securities, loan portfolios, client deposits, and sweep balances—through net interest revenue simulations, economic value of equity analyses, and tier 1 leverage and liquidity coverage ratio targets to preserve integrity and performance under changing interest-rate and market conditions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other disruptions, Schwab swiftly implemented remote work operations, enhanced online self-service capabilities, increased client service staffing, and migrated deposits to its balance sheet as capital levels permitted, thereby reconfiguring resources to sustain service quality and client satisfaction. Acquisition and integration of businesses such as TD Ameritrade and USAA-IMCO assets are governed by structured integration plans, milestone-based oversight, and contingency arrangements to reconstitute trajectories toward future objectives while realizing cost synergies. The company’s policies also address fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, model risk under SR 11-7, and incentive compensation oversight to ensure accountability, adaptability, and resilience in the face of external pressures, regulatory changes, and unexpected events.

Salesforce discloses that it has implemented disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, including duplicating production environments and customer data in near real time at alternate facilities, to preserve service integrity and performance despite natural disasters, public health emergencies, power loss, telecommunications failures or similar events.  The company maintains and improves business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, engages a board-level cybersecurity committee and executive management in regularly briefing on cyber risks and events, and retains the ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks to mitigate unauthorized access, breaches or service disruptions.  To absorb strain from rapid customer and product growth, Salesforce continuously plans for infrastructure capacity requirements, scales its data center and personnel resources, allocates additional investments in research and development and in its professional services organization, and adapts its go-to-market approach by changing and expanding its sales organization, while recognizing that these organizational changes can temporarily disrupt productivity.  In response to evolving external pressures such as supply-chain constraints, third-party vendor outages, global economic and geopolitical uncertainty and fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, the company has established credit facilities, foreign currency hedging programs and maintains sufficient cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to meet working capital, capital expenditure and debt obligations.  Salesforce also pursues proactive measures to comply with new data privacy, cross-border transfer, industry-specific and export/import regulations, to track and report ESG goals under frameworks such as TCFD and SASB, and to integrate acquired businesses and technologiesâ€”recognizing that the timing and effectiveness of integration and technology adoption are critical to sustaining organizational resilience, flexibility and long-term performance.

Our disclosures describe how we have maintained positive adjustment under challenging conditions by implementing business continuity measures, reallocating resources and reconfiguring operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other disruptions.  We note the significant impact of store closures, modified operating hours and reduced customer traffic on our company-operated and licensed stores, and the need to make controversial decisions on precautionary measures—such as vaccination requirements and face coverings—that affect our brand, employee retention and customer behavior, which may require impairment charges and limit deferred tax asset benefits.  We identify external pressures—from macroeconomic volatility, severe weather and natural or man-made disasters, climate change, supply-chain disruptions, geopolitical events, labor discord, terrorism, social unrest and additional health pandemics—that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail operations, and we describe our efforts to mitigate related risk by training and monitoring licensees and third-party providers, scaling and adapting supply-chain infrastructure, hedging commodity price exposure for coffee and dairy through price-to-be-fixed contracts and financial derivatives, and maintaining liquidity via cash and investment management, credit facilities and debt issuances.  We detail strategic initiatives—such as a North America restructuring plan blending new store formats, investments in employee wages and benefits to remain an employer of choice, digital and delivery innovation, global expansion, flexible store formats, product diversification, cost-reduction programs and sustainability efforts—that support our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under stress.  We further describe resilience mechanisms in our information-technology and cybersecurity programs, including incident-response, disaster-recovery and business-continuity planning to address potential system failures, cyber-attacks or data-privacy and regulatory compliance challenges, as well as governance over intellectual property, capital allocation for supply-chain and store investments, and contingency planning for international operations and tax-planning strategies, all of which reflect our multifaceted approach to sustaining performance and adapting to unexpected conditions.

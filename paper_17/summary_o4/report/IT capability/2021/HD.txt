In our risk disclosures, we highlight the strategic investments and operational processes designed to ensure the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including significant capital allocations to expand our supply chain, upgrade and integrate information technology systems and support processes, and enhance our interconnected retail strategy by coordinating our physical stores, distribution facilities and digital platforms with flexible fulfillment options such as BOSS, BOPIS, direct fulfillment and curbside pickup. These initiatives are supported by disciplined liquidity management—comprising commercial paper programs with back-up credit facilities, senior note issuances, and cash flow from operations—to preserve continuity of funding and customer service. We emphasize workforce resilience through targeted recruiting, training and compensation programs and the management of hybrid work models, as well as organizational changes to sustain labor capacity. Inventory integrity and performance are maintained under a retail inventory method with shrink estimation and impairment assessments. Robust cybersecurity measures, system maintenance, patching and disaster recovery planning support uninterrupted access to critical data and customer-facing systems. Purchase obligations, lease portfolio management, and tax and legal contingencies are managed within governance frameworks to mitigate risks from environmental disruptions, competitive pressures, pandemics, natural disasters and geopolitical events. This integrated approach to resource deployment, risk mitigation, and adaptive execution underpins our ability to absorb strain, preserve and improve functioning, and emerge stronger from adversity.

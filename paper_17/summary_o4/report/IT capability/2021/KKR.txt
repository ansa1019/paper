While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful, and our disclosures describe a range of operational and continuity initiatives—from mandatory vaccination policies, testing requirements and enhanced remote-working capabilities to the implementation of a formal business continuity plan and detailed contingency plans for key employees—to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions; we continuously monitor developments relating to the global spread of COVID-19 and assess potential adverse impacts on our business, including portfolio company operations and the counterparty ecosystem, while recognizing that the scope of the pandemic may heighten effects we cannot foresee; we rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data-processing systems and those of third-party service providers for everything from transaction execution and fund administration to policyholder services, and warn that any systems failure, disaster or disruptive event—whether cyber-attack, supply-chain interruption, natural disaster or other internal or external pressure—could materially interrupt our operations and outstrip our business continuation or disaster recovery programs despite regular testing and review; we have also taken steps to harden our cybersecurity posture and reduce dependence on concentrated vendor platforms, but acknowledge that remote environments may foster greater vulnerability to hacking, phishing and ransomware attempts and that our safeguards—alongside those of our counterparties and service providers—may not fully avert security breaches; and in our insurance operations we have established hedging strategies, collateral requirements and regulatory capital frameworks to preserve financial strength and enable recovery from market shocks, but remind investors that fluctuations in interest rates, equity markets and credit spreads, as well as regulatory changes, policyholder behavior and counterparty performance under funds-withheld and reinsurance arrangements, may test the integrity of our reserves, collateral structures and liquidity planning, and that adverse deviations from our actuarial assumptions could necessitate accelerated expense recognition or increased statutory capital, any of which could materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain functioning, absorb strain and sustain operations under extreme or exceptional conditions.

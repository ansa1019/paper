The company discloses that significant factors, events, and uncertainties—including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions—could, under challenging and unforeseen conditions, materially impair business continuity, financial condition, operating results and reputation, and that operations may be affected by internal or external variations such as labor and supply chain constraints, extreme weather, public health crises, geopolitical events, or technological failures. It acknowledges that rapid global expansion and diversification into new products, services and geographies places increased strain on management, personnel, systems, financial resources, and internal controls, and that failure to manage growth effectively could damage reputation, limit growth, and reduce operating results. The volatility and seasonality of demand, compounded by constrained labor markets and supply chain disruptions, can lead to inventory imbalances, increased shipping costs, and fulfillment network inefficiencies, while inadequate staffing or unexpected spikes in customer traffic may cause system interruptions, delays or unavailability of websites and services. The risk factors also note reliance on third-party technology and systems, cyber-security vulnerabilities and past security breaches, insufficient system redundancy, and potentially inadequate disaster recovery planning, any of which could disrupt operations, expose the company to liability, or require costly remediation. To mitigate these strains, the company maintains policies and processes designed to prevent fraud by sellers, invests in expanding and optimizing fulfillment and technology infrastructure, seeks to enhance process efficiencies, negotiates improved terms with suppliers, leverages variable and fixed cost management, and utilizes cash flows, credit facilities, and liquidity reserves to support capital expenditures and strategic initiatives. Provisions for legal, regulatory, tax, and contractual contingencies, as well as insurance and governance controls, form part of the company’s efforts to absorb pressures, preserve or improve functioning under adverse and extreme conditions, and maintain system integrity, operational flexibility, and resilience of its global business network.

The company acknowledges that general economic conditions, market cyclicality and the global spread of COVID-19 have created significant volatility, uncertainty and worldwide economic disruption, which could, among other things, reduce demand for its products and services, increase order cancellations or delays, create supply interruptions that disrupt its ability to produce products and extend sales cycles and lead times; in response, it has prioritized operational flexibility, close communication with sites, employees, customers and suppliers and the implementation of safety precautions to maintain business continuity and preserve functioning under adverse conditions. The company has mobilized across its life sciences, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics and laboratory products and biopharma services segments to scale and evolve molecular diagnostics solutions, plastic consumables, biosciences and bioproduction capacity and to provide pharma services that support vaccine and therapeutic development, while recognizing that the duration and extent of COVID-19’s impacts remain undeterminable and dependent on customer demand. Its proven growth strategy—comprising significant investment in innovative product development, expansion of geographic reach and e-commerce platforms, enhancement of service and operational infrastructure, and disciplined capital deployment via mergers and acquisitions—is underpinned by robust free cash flow generation, available borrowing capacity and targeted strategic growth investments, including the application of continuous improvement methodologies through its practical process improvement business system, global sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations to improve cost efficiencies and organizational resilience. The company further highlights risks arising from reliance on sole or limited sources of supply, natural disasters, public health crises, political turmoil, cybersecurity breaches and evolving regulations, each of which may impair its ability to maintain integrity and performance under pressure, and it continues to assess and reinforce its information technology systems, risk management controls and integration processes—aligning standards, controls, procedures and policies and retaining key employees—to preserve operational continuity, adaptability and long-term financial flexibility.

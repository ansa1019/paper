The report describes the organization’s efforts to preserve operational continuity under challenging conditions, noting that the COVID-19 pandemic and related office closures, restrictions on access and employee well-being pressures disrupted business operations and client service delivery and could do so again, prompting the maintenance and testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans for pandemics, natural disasters, cyberattacks, infrastructure failures and other exceptional events. It highlights the concentration of our global delivery capability in India and the Philippines and the consequent need for operational flexibility through remote work adaptations, rapid rebalancing of resources—including hiring, reskilling, redeploying personnel and, if necessary, involuntary terminations—to align workforce supply with evolving client demand, as well as the use of currency protection provisions and hedging programs to mitigate financial risks from exchange rate fluctuations. The discussion emphasizes strategic initiatives to innovate and expand services—such as digital, cloud, security, automation and AI offerings—to anticipate and respond to technological change, environmental turbulence and competitive pressures, and underscores our reliance on alliance relationships, contractual performance incentives and penalties, cost-management strategies and internal control frameworks to sustain financial stability, assess risk, reconfigure resources and adapt our organizational practices so as to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning and maintain performance despite internal or external variations and disturbances.

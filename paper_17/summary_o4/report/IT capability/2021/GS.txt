The report describes a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework built around formal governance, processes and people and overseen by the board and dedicated risk committees, through which the firm regularly identifies, assesses, limits and monitors market, credit, liquidity, operational, model and conduct risks via stress testing, scenario analysis and reverse‐stress analysis, enabling it to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve functioning under challenging conditions. It details a business continuity and operational resilience program led by a central crisis team and supported by the firmwide operational risk and resilience committee, which maintains tested recovery plans, redundant systems and remote‐work capabilities to secure employee safety and ensure uninterrupted client service. The firm pre‐funds projected cash and collateral needs in a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets, holds diversified secured and unsecured funding with conservative tenors, and follows a contingency funding plan that outlines key metrics, escalations and mitigants for a range of stress scenarios, thereby maintaining systemic flexibility and strategic agility. Multiple oversight bodies—such as the asset‐liability, suitability, conduct, capital and new‐activity committees—periodically review and adapt policies, triggers and limits to respond effectively to market dislocations, credit pressures, cyber threats and third‐party failures. Day‐to‐day resilience is further supported by independent risk oversight and control functions that validate valuation models, enforce underwriting standards, monitor exposures and breaches, and coordinate control self‐assessments and internal audit, all aimed at enabling rapid adaptation, recovery, learning and sustained performance in the face of internal or external disruptions.

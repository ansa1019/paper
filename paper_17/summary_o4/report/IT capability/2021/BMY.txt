Bristol-Myers Squibb’s disclosures describe a comprehensive risk assessment and business continuity framework designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances—ranging from global disease outbreaks, natural disasters and supply chain interruptions to regulatory, legal and cyber-security threats—through proactive mitigation planning, maintenance of critical safety-stock levels, complex chain-of-identity and custody protocols for therapeutics and contractual requirements for third-party continuity plans; an operating model transformation that rationalizes commercial, R&D and manufacturing resources, streamlines administrative functions and integrates Celgene and MyoKardia systems across manufacturing, finance, sales, IT and human capital management to reconfigure operational trajectories in real time; agile workforce strategies including staggered site re-entry, vaccination mandates and remote engagement to safeguard employee health and sustain patient support; robust information-technology protections, continuous monitoring and cyber insurance to maintain system integrity and performance; governance processes for monitoring distributor and direct-customer inventory, limiting sales to expected demand and adjusting estimates for charge-backs, rebates and returns to protect financial resilience; and an ongoing emphasis on data-driven strategic planning, resource allocation and inter-organizational collaboration to adapt to evolving conditions, manage risk, reconstitute capabilities and emerge stronger from exceptional events.

Stryker discloses that the COVID-19 pandemic “has materially adversely affected, and could continue to materially adversely affect, our operations, supply chain, manufacturing, product distribution, customers and other business activities” and “has led to severe disruptions in the market and the United States and international economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown”; that “in response, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented, and may continue to implement, numerous measures to contain the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns”; that “a significant number of our customers, global suppliers, distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic and those operations have been, and could continue to be, materially affected by restrictive measures implemented in response to the pandemic”; that “as a result, some of our customers, distributors and indirect sales channels have at times been unable to retain employees, distribute or use our products or provide required services”; that “any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or delay in delivering our products may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all”; that the pandemic “could adversely impact our ability, and the ability of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers, to retain key employees and ensure the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our, and their, complex operations”; that “to the extent our management or other personnel, or the management or other personnel of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers, are impacted in significant numbers by the pandemic and are not available to perform their job duties, we could experience delays in, or the suspension of, our manufacturing operations, sales activities, research and product development activities, regulatory work streams, clinical development programs and other important commercial and corporate functions”; that “the actions we take to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on our workforce could reduce the efficiency of our operations or prove insufficient”; that “we have experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted and continues to shift or as may be mandated by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic”; that “we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow, including through the reduction of operating expenses or suspension of dividend payments, at least until the consequences of the pandemic subside”; that “we rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business” and that “numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats have posed, and will continue to pose, risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and product offerings, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data” and that “if our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information … and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action”; that “disruptions of transportation due to a global pandemic of contagious diseases like COVID-19 … such as reduced availability of transportation, port closures, increased border controls or closures, increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain” could arise; that “interruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business” and that “in the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand … we may experience loss of market share, additional expense and harm to our reputation”; that our reliance on “a variety of raw materials, components, devices and third-party services in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes” exposes us to “significant shortages, price increases or unavailability of third-party services [which] could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products” and that “we may experience inflationary increases in manufacturing costs and operating expenses, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, and may not be able to pass these cost increases on to our customers in a timely manner”; and that “shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters … which could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions, damage to our products and facilities as well as the infrastructure of hospitals, medical care facilities and other customers, reduced workforce availability, increased costs of raw materials and components, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues than what we have experienced in the past from such events.”

The report describes how the company has absorbed strain and preserved or improved functioning despite adversity by deploying business continuity and crisis management protocols, health and safety measures and flexible labor arrangements in response to the Covid-19 pandemic; by adapting distribution channels, including expanded e-commerce and direct-to-consumer platforms, chilled direct-store delivery and digital marketing capabilities; by managing supply-chain disruptions arising from raw-material shortages, labor constraints, transportation bottlenecks and border restrictions through fixed-price contracts, productivity initiatives and derivative hedges; by embedding resilience strategies within its “PepsiCo Positive” end-to-end transformation—anchored in sustainable sourcing, regenerative agriculture, net-zero emissions, net-water positivity and circular packaging—to foresee, confront and benefit from sudden disruptive change; by governing risk through an integrated risk-management framework that engages the board, cross-functional risk committees and enterprise audit functions to identify, assess, prioritize, monitor and respond to strategic, operational, compliance, safety, cyber and environmental risks; and by continuously reconfiguring resources and capabilities—through multi-year productivity and shared-services initiatives, enterprise resource planning rollouts and periodic review of acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and structural changes—to maintain system integrity, operational flexibility and competitive advantage under volatile external pressures.

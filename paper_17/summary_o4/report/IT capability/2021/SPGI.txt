Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and other potential disruptions, S&P Global’s business continuity program has been effective to date, with “nearly our entire employee population … working remotely” and regular assessments “to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession,” while acknowledging that “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.” The company’s divisions “are publishing articles and research pieces that attempt to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic … and are taking actions (including, but not limited to, rating actions, revising the composition of our indices, etc.), consistent with our business procedures, in response to evolving conditions.” In preparation for its pending merger with IHS Markit, the company “has agreed to divest certain businesses in order to procure regulatory approval,” operates “subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions,” and “expects to incur substantial expenses and devote significant resources in connection with the completion of the merger and related divestitures, and the integration,” while recognizing that “the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis, if at all,” including “increased cybersecurity risk” and “difficulties in integrating the businesses … could harm the reputation.” The company further notes that “should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem … our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations.” Additionally, S&P Global is “exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information” and “relies on its information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings,” underscoring its focus on preserving system integrity and operational resilience in both nominal and exceptional circumstances.

Our disclosures describe the maintenance of our operational integrity and performance under challenging conditions by continuously adjusting internal resources, processes, and structures to absorb strain from adverse events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory shifts, cyberattacks, macro-economic volatility, and competitive pressures.  We have diversified payment capabilities, expanded merchant and agency models, and implemented flexible cancellation policies to preserve customer demand and firm performance amid travel restrictions, shifting consumer sentiment, and geopolitical uncertainties.  We rely on the talents of highly skilled employees and have reconfigured our workforce and cost structure—including through government assistance programs, targeted workforce reductions, and ongoing investment in training and recruitment—to sustain organizational capabilities and innovation.  To support business continuity, we maintain redundant systems, phased global IT migrations, and disaster-recovery measures, while continuously enhancing cybersecurity defenses, market-driven performance-marketing efficiency, and brand-building initiatives to mitigate risks and sustain competitive advantage.  We actively manage liquidity through a €2 billion revolving credit facility with minimum-liquidity covenants and maintain cash and liquid investments to ensure operational flexibility under internal and external variations.  In pursuing strategic acquisitions and integrations, we apply rigorous risk assessments, goodwill and asset impairment testing, and dynamic compliance protocols to reconstitute and reconfigure our business in response to evolving regulatory, tax, and competition landscapes, thereby preserving our positive adjustment, future orientation, and ability to emerge stronger from disruptive change.

Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment; similarly, the company collects, manages and processes protected personal data under stringent regional and local data protection laws and monitors third-party providers for security breaches, acknowledging that no assurance can be given that these measures will prevent future attacks or disruptions. To respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Abbott mobilized its teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch various new diagnostic tests under emergency use authorizations, aligned its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests to evolving demand projections, recorded restructuring charges for fixed asset write-downs, inventory adjustments and contract or severance costs, and, as case counts and variants shifted, sold previously impaired inventory and reduced exit costs as testing demand rebounded. The company continuously monitors its global supply chain for potential disruptions—including equipment malfunction, protocol failures, raw material or service shortages, cyber attacks, natural disasters, and environmental factors—and takes actions to offset inflationary pressures in manufacturing inputs and transportation, while recognizing that significant disruptions or shortages may still occur. Abbott maintains credit facilities, including a five-year unsecured $5 billion revolving credit agreement and hedging arrangements to mitigate foreign currency exposure, and actively manages its indebtedness through refinancing, early redemptions and credit rating considerations to preserve liquidity and operational flexibility. It analyzes historical rebate trends, adjusts reserves for changes in program terms, and assesses customer creditworthiness to estimate and record allowances for doubtful accounts, ensuring financial continuity under diverse customer and regulatory arrangements. Periodically, the company restructures operations, integrates acquisitions, disposes of or spins-off businesses, and streamlines processes—incurring severance and asset write-down charges—to improve efficiencies and resource allocation across its medical devices, diagnostics, nutritional and pharmaceutical segments. These practices collectively support Abbott’s ability to absorb strain and maintain or enhance its integrity and performance under internal or external variations and disturbances, preserving business continuity and positioning the organization to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

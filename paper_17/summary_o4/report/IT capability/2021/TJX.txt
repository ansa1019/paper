In response to the COVID-19 pandemic our operations implemented enhanced cleaning protocols, occupancy limitations and additional health and safety procedures that increased payroll and expenses while adapting store operations under government-mandated closures and restrictions, and we have continued to monitor developments requiring further operational changes. We manage supply-chain disruptions and increased costs by reallocating sourcing strategies, expanding distribution capacity, adjusting inventory mix through opportunistic buying, lean inventory levels, frequent turns and flexible floor-space allocation, supported by forecasting processes to align sales and expense planning. Our merchants are tasked with assessing rapidly changing market trends and making timely sourcing decisions, while we routinely enter into foreign-currency and fuel hedges to mitigate earnings volatility. We rely heavily on comprehensive IT systems and disaster-recovery plans to maintain system integrity and business continuity, and recent cyber-security threats have prompted additional investments in mitigation strategies, workforce training and resilient technologies. As we expand internationally through new markets, partnerships, store openings, acquisitions, joint ventures and e-commerce platforms, we continue to develop the requisite infrastructure, coordinate policies and collaborate with vendors and service providers to preserve organizational coherence and effective information sharing across banners and regions. We maintain strong cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures, debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends, and regularly reassess liquidity sources, credit facilities and debt maturities to ensure financial resilience. We also maintain policies, procedures and internal controls to address regulatory, legal, health and safety risks, scenario-based planning for catastrophic events, and forecasting of consumer behavior to enable positive adjustment under challenging conditions and sustain performance despite environmental turbulence or exceptional disruptions.

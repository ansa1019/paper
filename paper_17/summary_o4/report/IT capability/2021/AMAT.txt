The report describes how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global containment measures have materially disrupted Applied’s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce availability, productivity and broader operations, as well as those of its customers, suppliers and partners worldwide. Government-imposed travel and logistics restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and policies such as remote working, social distancing and other safety protocols have resulted in transportation interruptions, production delays, capacity limitations and additional cybersecurity risks associated with an extensive remote workforce. In response to these pressures, Applied rapidly implemented precautionary measures to maintain healthy and safe workplaces, supported workplace flexibility, and developed a multi-phase plan to return employees onsite that takes into account business and employee needs, local regulations, community health trends and public health guidance, gradually allowing additional workers to return while practicing enhanced safety measures and continuously monitoring the pandemic’s impact on its business and that of its ecosystem. To manage near-term supply chain constraints and volatile customer demand, the company emphasizes accurate demand forecasting, agile resource and production-capacity management, the maintenance of sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory, proactive supplier management with alternatives when requirements are unmet, and the attraction, retention and motivation of qualified employees while controlling costs. Applied also periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems to better manage global operations, align its organizations and enable future growth, and it regularly monitors and prudently manages financial and credit risks in its investment portfolio, including selling accounts receivable and discounting letters of credit, thereby preserving operational flexibility, financial stability and continuity under adverse and uncertain conditions.

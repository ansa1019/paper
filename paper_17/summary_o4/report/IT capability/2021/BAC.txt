The report repeatedly underscores the firm’s emphasis on preserving business continuity and operational resilience under stress, noting the execution of comprehensive business continuity plans during the pandemic, the establishment of financial contingency and recovery plans, and diversified funding sources—including high-quality liquid assets, central bank facilities and a global liquidity buffer—to withstand severe market shocks and unexpected liquidity outflows. Governance of resilience is embedded in a formal risk framework overseen by the board and senior committees, integrating credit, market, liquidity, operational and compliance risk management, with annual approval of risk appetite limits, ongoing scenario analysis, stress testing of both trading and banking-book exposures, and contingency planning for capital, liquidity and resolution under a single-point-of-entry strategy. Operational strength is further bolstered by a rigorous information security program to prevent, detect and recover from cyberattacks, by model risk policies to validate critical quantitative tools, and by robust third-party risk controls, all designed to maintain system integrity, adapt to evolving external pressures and ensure the organization’s ability to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

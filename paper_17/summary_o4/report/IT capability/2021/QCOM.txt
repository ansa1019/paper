We describe how the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on our business and prompted us to modify our workforce practices, having the vast majority of our employees work from home and operate under a hybrid working environment in order to preserve critical functions, support operational continuity, manage health risks and safely reopen our offices. We identify the risk of disruptions to our supply chain and manufacturing operations due to delayed or cancelled customer orders, supplier insolvencies, natural disasters, climate-related events, geopolitical conflicts or government restrictions, and describe our mitigation strategies, which include establishing alternate suppliers, securing multi-year capacity commitments, increasing capital expenditures to expand manufacturing and production capacity, and diversifying raw material sources to ensure business continuity. We discuss our comprehensive cybersecurity program, aligned with international frameworks, to detect, repel and respond to sophisticated attacks that could compromise our technology, intellectual property and critical information, as well as our commitment to ongoing investments in research and development and share-based compensation to sustain innovation and product leadership. We outline our strategic initiatives—acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships—that reconstitute our competitive and technology trajectories, emphasize the integration of new businesses, the retention of engineering talent and the evolution of our patent portfolio to maintain revenue streams under regulatory, antitrust and licensing challenges. We maintain that our liquidity—cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and operating cash flows—combined with disciplined capital return programs, debt management and contingency reserves, provides the financial resources necessary to absorb strain, preserve functioning and maintain integrity under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions, thereby supporting our resilience as an organization.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to focus on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business, and we are continuing to monitor the actual and potential effects of the pandemic across our operations. We have implemented operational changes, including a hybrid return-to-work model that varies among geographies in accordance with health protocols, without affecting our ability to maintain operations, financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. Our business operations remain subject to interruption by natural disasters, flooding, fire, power shortages, pandemics such as COVID-19, terrorism, political unrest, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyber-attacks, geopolitical instability, war, the effects of climate change and other events beyond our control; although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our customers. The transformation to digital operations, enabled by the Now Platform, increases our customers’ resiliency and security and delivers additional value to their employees and consumers. We devote significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures while meeting customer expectations for system performance; however, as cyber-security threats develop and grow more complex, we continue to make substantial investments to protect data and infrastructure, yet a residual risk may remain despite our preventative efforts. Disruptions or defects in our services—whether resulting from actual or perceived quality issues, software vulnerabilities including those in third-party or open source code, denial of service or ransomware attacks, or failures in our and our third-party service providers’ supply chain—could damage our customers’ businesses, subject us to substantial liability, harm our reputation, reduce revenues through service credits or contract terminations, and adversely affect our financial results and growth prospects. Changing laws, regulations and standards related to data privacy, residency, sovereignty, security authorizations and other government requirements may require us to incur substantial operational costs, modify our data handling practices or limit the availability of our services in certain jurisdictions, potentially impeding our customers’ global deployment strategies. Natural disasters, climate-related events and other catastrophic occurrences can damage or disrupt our facilities, data centers and critical business operations despite our crisis and disaster response plans, which could hinder our ability to deliver services, recover data and resume normal operations, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

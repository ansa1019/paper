Mastercard’s annual report describes an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies, including risk management policies and procedures, collateral requirements, participant default policies and the ability to complete timely switching of financial transactions underpinned by adequate capital and financial resource requirements. The company notes that the global COVID-19 pandemic prompted modifications to business practices—such as employee travel, work locations and remote or hybrid environments—and that it continues to monitor these evolving conditions, ready to take further actions as required in the best interests of employees, customers and business partners to preserve operational continuity. Mastercard’s operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in its own systems and those of third-party providers, and the company routinely faces cyber-threats and information security incidents that could disrupt service; accordingly it continually develops and enhances controls, processes and practices to protect its infrastructure from attack, damage or unauthorized access and may expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities. To ensure liquidity for general corporate purposes, including potential settlement failures by customers or business continuity needs, Mastercard maintains a committed unsecured $6 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program and guarantees the settlement of many customer transactions through dedicated credit and settlement risk management arrangements. As Mastercard expands complex multi-rail solutions and integrated products and services, it acknowledges the operational and onboarding challenges—such as cost overruns, delivery delays and performance issues—that require enhanced infrastructure and monitoring, warning that failure to effectively design and deliver these solutions could result in reputational harm, regulatory scrutiny or competitive disadvantage. The company also manages transactional currency exposure through foreign exchange derivatives aligned with forecasted transactions to mitigate adverse currency effects and applies a privacy-by-design and data-by-design approach to product development in response to rapidly evolving regulatory and market expectations.

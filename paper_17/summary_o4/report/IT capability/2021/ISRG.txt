The Company’s disclosures describe multiple dimensions of resilience in the face of internal and external disturbances, including the adverse impact of public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic on operations, supply chains, distribution systems, staffing, facility access and customer demand, as well as the measures taken to maintain business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The disclosures note significant business disruptions—from restrictions on travel, temporary closures of Company and supplier facilities, and shifts to remote and hybrid work environments that entail operational flexibility challenges, cyber-security vulnerabilities, and impacts on productivity and corporate culture—to which the Company has responded by reallocating resources, modifying purchase order coverage and inventory levels, intensifying communications with suppliers, and investing in robust information technology infrastructure and encryption measures.  Supply-chain fragmentation and sole-sourcing risks are acknowledged, as are actions to mitigate component shortages and inflationary pressures through alternative sourcing, increased purchase orders, and inventory management.  The Company identifies the potential for natural disasters, climate-driven events, terrorism, government shutdowns, and other emergencies to interrupt critical manufacturing, distribution, and regulatory review processes, and it emphasizes the need for emergency management, operational continuity, and adaptability in facilities planning, construction and validation of alternate sites.  Information-security risk management is highlighted through programs to detect, contain and respond to data-security incidents, reliance on external vendors’ controls, and the establishment of policies and procedures to safeguard personal and proprietary data, all of which reflect systemic perspective, risk assessment, and resilience strategies.  The impact of changing regulatory environments, including evolving quality, labeling, medical-device and data-privacy regulations in multiple jurisdictions, underscores the importance of compliance as an organizational capability for preserving integrity and functioning under pressure.  Finally, business continuity and future orientation are further supported by investments in research and development, strategic acquisitions, and flexible financing and leasing arrangements, reflecting the Company’s dynamic capability to reconfigure trajectories of response, recover from disruptions, and deploy resources toward sustaining performance and competitive advantage in a turbulent and uncertain environment.

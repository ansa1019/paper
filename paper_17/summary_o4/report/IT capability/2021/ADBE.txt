The report discloses that the spread of COVID-19 has caused the company to modify its business practices, including implementing prolonged closures and limited reopenings of certain offices, restricting employee travel, and offering a significant percentage of employees flexibility in the amount of time they work in an office, all of which may adversely impact productivity and require additional investments in the design, implementation and enforcement of new workplace health and safety protocols; starting in June 2021, the company began a phased reopening of its U.S. and certain international offices on a voluntary basis, but acknowledges that additional or extended governmental restrictions or changing conditions could force temporary re-closures, and that its efforts to reopen safely—even if following best practices—may not succeed and could expose employees, partners and customers to health risks and associated liability. The company notes that as long as the pandemic continues, employees will remain exposed to health risks and that it may adjust its policies and practices in response to evolving public health guidance, with existing and new precautionary measures potentially negatively affecting operations; further, virtual-only customer, employee and industry events may not be as successful as in-person events, and conditions caused by the pandemic have delayed customer purchasing decisions, reduced the value or duration of subscription contracts and increased attrition rates, any of which could harm future sales, operating results and financial performance. The report highlights that its operations have also been negatively affected by a range of external factors beyond its control, including the emergence of more transmissible variants, variable vaccine adoption rates and the indefinite persistence of macroeconomic effects, and warns that if it is not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, its business will be harmed and many other risks may be heightened. In addition to pandemic-related disruptions, the company relies on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver services and acknowledges that it does not have redundancy for all of its systems, with many critical applications residing in only one data center and disaster recovery planning that may not account for all eventualities; any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, failures in data collection or transmission, unexpected interruptions during data migrations, hardware or software failures, or spikes in customer activity could impair service delivery, violate service-level agreements, expose the company to regulatory and customer notification requirements, financial liabilities or reputational harm, and require additional investments or expanded infrastructure capacity. The report further identifies catastrophic events—such as earthquakes, fires, floods, tsunamis, power losses, cyber-attacks, war, terrorist attacks or wildfires leading to power shut-offs—as well as climate change risks (including drought, wildfire danger and extreme weather events) and hardware supply-chain disruptions stemming from the pandemic, as material risks that could disrupt its network infrastructure, enterprise applications and critical business operations, prevent order fulfillment or impair its ability to conduct normal business, thereby adversely affecting its future operating results.

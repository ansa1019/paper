The report acknowledges that our business must continually absorb internal and external disturbances—ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic and regulatory shifts to cyberattacks, natural disasters and other operational hazards—while preserving critical functions and financial performance. It describes how we have modified business practices, including shifts to remote work, hybrid office models and increased use of videoconferencing, and how we respond to potential service disruptions from third-party providers, all of which require rapid resource reallocation, execution risk mitigation and operational flexibility to sustain continuity. The description of our strategic initiatives—such as participation in the Paycheck Protection Program, mergers and acquisitions, ongoing innovation to meet evolving customer needs, and continual investment in information technology, security protections and cloud infrastructure—highlights our systemic perspective on resilience, emphasizing capacity building, adaptation to technological change and global trends, and proactive risk assessment. We also emphasize seasonality planning, maintenance of strong liquidity through credit facilities and senior unsecured notes, and vigilant monitoring of counterparty and regulatory risks, all of which support our ability to reconfigure trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events and to preserve or improve functioning under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

Natural disasters, pandemics, economic, political, regulatory, acts of war or threats of war, or other developments could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities, and our business continuity plans and other safeguards might not always be effective to fully mitigate their impact, and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be adversely impacted during the continuation of the covid-19 pandemic. We are continuously evolving our approach to business continuity planning and backups to provide appropriate business resilience, particularly in light of the increasing cyber threat landscape, but our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, and if key personnel or a significant number of employees or business partners become unavailable due to the covid-19 outbreak, our ability to respond to unexpected situations could be impaired. While many third-party manufacturing and service arrangements improve efficiencies and decrease our operating costs, they also diminish our direct control, which may have a material adverse effect on the quality and availability of products or services, our supply chain, and the speed and flexibility in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences. We work closely with our electronics manufacturing service providers to monitor their production capability and financial health, yet cannot guarantee they will remain capable of meeting their commitments, particularly during the covid-19 pandemic; if they are significantly constrained at the same time, the supply of our devices could be disrupted and the commercialization of our reduced-risk products could be adversely affected. The current global semiconductor shortage has resulted in a tightness in IQOS device supply in the second half of 2021, and although the situation eased in the fourth quarter and we expect an improving supply situation with a gradual return to unconstrained user growth, we still do not have full visibility over the full year 2022. Failure of our information systems and systems owned and operated by our business partners to function as intended, or their penetration with the intent to corrupt them, could result in business disruption, loss of reputation, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other confidential data, and we continuously evolve our approach to business continuity planning and cybersecurity protocols to provide appropriate business resilience.

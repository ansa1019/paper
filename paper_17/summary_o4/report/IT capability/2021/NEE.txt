In their annual report, NextEra Energy and its Florida Power & Light subsidiary describe a comprehensive approach to sustaining operations and preserving performance under internal and external pressures by maintaining regulatory cost‐recovery mechanisms, diversified funding sources and reserve amortization strategies that enable positive adjustment in the face of severe weather events, regulatory changes, fuel price volatility and other disruptions. They emphasize operational flexibility through extensive storm restoration funds and accelerated reserve amortization to reconstitute service following hurricanes, the use of derivative hedges and margin collateral arrangements to mitigate commodity price and market risk, and the negotiation of bilateral and syndicated credit facilities to support liquidity and business continuity. Their planning and investment in generation, transmission and distribution assets, together with ongoing license, permit and interconnection management, reflect a systemic perspective and future orientation in resource deployment and strategic adaptation. Credit support agreements, insurance programs, pension and decommissioning funds serve as financial resilience buffers, while structured risk management policies, master netting agreements and counterparty credit reviews underpin their capacity to absorb strain and maintain functioning despite price, regulatory or operational perturbations. These combined measures—spanning cost‐recovery clauses, capital structure management, trading and marketing safeguards, emergency response protocols and portfolio reconfiguration initiatives—illustrate the company’s multifaceted resilience strategies designed to preserve organizational integrity and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

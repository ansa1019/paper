Lockheed Martin’s 2021 annual report describes multiple practices and adjustments that demonstrate its capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions. In response to COVID-19 delays, the company tapered and then re­baselined its F-35 production rate, exceeding its delivery targets and recovering shortfalls, while accelerating approximately $2.2 billion of supplier payments to maintain business continuity across its supply chain. The company also deployed a $3 billion revolving credit facility and managed working capital through the percentage-of-completion contract accounting method, monitoring contract-level risk retirements to adjust profit booking rates and sustain performance under evolving program requirements and funding uncertainty. During the year, $36 million of severance and restructuring charges were recorded to consolidate facilities and reshape the workforce, and the company transferred $4.9 billion of defined benefit pension obligations to group annuity contracts to reduce volatility and stabilize financial resources. Backlog management remained central to resource allocation, with more than 38 % of the December 31, 2021 backlog expected to convert to revenue within 12 months, while the company continued to monitor government appropriations, offset agreements and international demand to manage complexity and sustain liquidity. Together, these strategic responses—ranging from accelerated supplier support, credit facility access, pension risk transfers, workforce realignment and contract-level adjustments—illustrate Lockheed Martin’s systemic perspective, risk mitigation, operational flexibility and capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

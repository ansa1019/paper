Throughout the reporting period, the company has directed resources and instituted resilience strategies to absorb strain and preserve performance under adverse conditions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on maintaining a supply of our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing treatments for COVID-19; protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting our communities; and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicines, particularly insulin, including investment in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk to ensure rapid access to patients worldwide. The strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in overall demand in our industry for certain materials, resulting in changed buying patterns and constrained supply, have had, and may continue to have, a number of impacts on our business, including increased costs to provide a consistent supply of our medicines where they are needed and disruptions and shortages in the supply of our medicines. We adjust in-person interactions with healthcare professionals as safety and guidance permit and continue to implement measures in an effort to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent cybersecurity risks and to enhance the resiliency of our IT systems. Management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, and we believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements. We had $5.26 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $5.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. We engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments, while acknowledging significant risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions and recognizing that difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses, products, or assets we acquire may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions. We also manage interest rate, foreign currency, and equity-price exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, and we monitor evolving government price controls, reimbursement, and regulatory reforms, anticipating that restrictive measures may intensify and require operational flexibility and strategic adaptation. These coordinated initiatives and resource allocations illustrate the companyâ€™s ability to absorb adversity and maintain organizational functioning despite external pressures and disruptions.

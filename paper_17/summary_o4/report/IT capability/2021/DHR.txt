Danaher’s 2021 annual report underscores that the company operates in a turbulent global environment marked by pandemics, natural disasters, economic and geopolitical volatility, supply-chain disruptions, cyber-attacks and regulatory changes, and that it has responded by activating and continuously updating its business continuity plans, modifying business practices and implementing return-to-workplace protocols to safeguard its workforce and maintain operational continuity.  It describes reallocating manufacturing capacity under U.S. Defense Production Act requirements and investing in expanded bioprocessing and molecular diagnostics capabilities to meet COVID-19 vaccine, therapeutic and testing demands while recognizing the risk that such actions may prove premature or insufficient.  The company cites its geographically and industry-diverse portfolio of products and services, system redundancy and disaster recovery planning, cybersecurity defenses and proactive risk assessment as means to limit the impact of localized economic or environmental shocks.  Danaher further emphasizes its strategic resilience through disciplined allocation of R&D funding toward high-growth opportunities, ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, agile product and service innovation, collaborations with third parties and government agencies, prudent capital deployment—including a mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt, commercial paper facilities and hedging of currency and interest-rate exposures—and continuous monitoring of evolving market and regulatory conditions to preserve performance and ensure positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

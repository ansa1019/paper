Merck’s Form 10-K discloses that the company is subject to a broad spectrum of internal and external pressures—ranging from the unpredictability of economic conditions, cost-reduction measures by governments and continuing pricing pressures to climate-related physical and transitional risks and cyber-attacks—that could materially impair its ability to preserve or improve operational performance under challenging conditions; it acknowledges that significant global operations expose it to additional risks, including adverse events, supply-chain disruptions and pandemic-related volatility in physician-administered product revenues, and it has therefore increased investments in research and development, manufacturing capacity expansion, collaborations and acquisitions to reconfigure its portfolio, sustain resource flows and support business continuity; to manage financial exposures it enters into hedging agreements for currency and interest-rate fluctuations, maintains committed credit facilities alongside strong cash-flow generation, and believes these measures, together with its capital allocation strategies—including dividends, share repurchases and restructuring-driven cost savings—will enable it to absorb strain, maintain liquidity and adapt its organizational structure and processes in response to regulatory, market and technological changes; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company redirected manufacturing facilities to produce antiviral and vaccine candidates, implemented enhanced information-technology monitoring and crisis-response protocols to detect, contain and recover from network attacks, and adjusted operating expense and supply-chain planning to mitigate the adverse impact of social-distancing measures and logistical disruptions, thereby reinforcing the firm’s capacity to continue critical functions, reassign resources and uphold performance under adverse and rapidly evolving conditions.

The companyâ€™s disclosures emphasize that maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions depends on robust business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans, supported by key management succession and crisis management processes. It warns that an inability to recover from disasters, cyberattacks, power or telecommunications failures or other continuity events could cause material financial loss, human capital loss, regulatory actions, reputational damage and legal liability. The firm relies on the uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks, continuous investments in technology infrastructure, timely patching and security control upgrades, and careful integration of third-party vendor services and acquired systems to preserve operational flexibility. Remote and hybrid work arrangements, adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased cyber-security exposures and reinforced the need to evolve business practices, health and safety protocols and adaptive strategies. The company maintains credit facility arrangements, currency hedging and other liquidity measures to support resilience under adverse conditions and reports that its pandemic response and hybrid work models have thus far demonstrated resilience in servicing clients, while recognizing that significant continuity events could still materially disrupt operations.

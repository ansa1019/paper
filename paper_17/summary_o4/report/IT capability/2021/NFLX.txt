In its 10-K, Netflix discloses that “the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the various responses to it have disrupted our business, increased our costs, led to delays in content releases and may continue to impact our business and results of operations,” and that “we will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations, including content production, as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, members, partners and stockholders.” The company highlights its need to adapt to environmental perturbations, stating that “if we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected,” and that as it expands internationally it is “scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth” while “building out expertise in a number of disciplines” to address the “growing complexity of our business.” Netflix underscores its operational flexibility and risk mitigation mechanisms through its global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) and reliance on third-party “cloud” computing services, noting that “any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties…could result in a loss or degradation of service…which could adversely impact our business,” and that it “has implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems.” The company identifies dependencies on partners and regulatory regimes, observing that “if partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content…our service may be adversely impacted,” and that “if government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our business, or incur greater operating expenses.” Netflix also details its financial resilience, warning that “the long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity,” but it “anticipate[s] that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources…will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs.” Through these disclosures, the company outlines its resource allocation, strategic foresight, continuity planning, and adaptive strategies aimed at preserving integrity and performance under internal and external variations, consistent with maintaining “positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

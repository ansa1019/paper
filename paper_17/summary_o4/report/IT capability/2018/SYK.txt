The company maintains a range of resilience measures designed to preserve operational integrity and performance under adverse conditions, including comprehensive business continuity planning and monitoring of its information technology systems to address cybersecurity threats, system failures or third-party disruptions; diversification of manufacturing sites coupled with contingency protocols to mitigate impacts from natural disasters, equipment breakdowns or regulatory compliance issues and the capacity to seek alternate production sources while recognizing the potential for regulatory approval delays; supply-chain risk management that acknowledges reliance on sole-source suppliers for certain critical raw materials and components and the attendant inventory reserves and qualification processes required to manage shortages and price volatility; disciplined implementation of a global enterprise resource planning system with integrated change-management processes to prevent disruptions to order processing, product shipment, service delivery and customer support; strategic human capital initiatives aimed at attracting, retaining and deploying key employees to support ongoing operations and growth; financial resilience through robust cash generation from operations, access to commercial paper and committed credit facilities, active hedging of foreign currency exposures, and a capital allocation framework prioritizing acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases to ensure resource availability; and ongoing evaluation of contingent liabilities, tax positions and litigation reserves to manage legal and regulatory uncertainties, all of which collectively underpin the companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning in the face of external and internal pressures.

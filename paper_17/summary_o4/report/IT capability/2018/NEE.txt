In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NEE and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their business and any inability or failure to do so adequately could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. NEE’s and FPL’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions also depends on timely recovery of significant costs, returns on certain assets and reasonable returns on invested capital through base rates, cost recovery clauses or other regulatory mechanisms. As an electric utility, FPL operates under FPSC jurisdiction that can disallow recovery of costs deemed excessive or imprudently incurred and limit FPL’s earnings, potentially requiring FPL to cancel or delay planned development activities, reduce or delay capital expenditures or incur non-recoverable costs. To mitigate storm-related adversity, FPL used available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the write-off of Hurricane Irma storm restoration costs and plans to partially restore the reserve amortization through tax savings generated under its 2016 rate agreement, which establishes its allowed regulatory ROE and provides for retail rate base increases, with reserve amortization calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of rate base and capital structure in order to earn a targeted regulatory return. NEE and FPL face risks related to the siting, financing, construction, permitting and negotiation of project development agreements, any failure of which may result in cost overruns, delay or termination payments and write-offs of investment. The operation and maintenance of NEE’s and FPL’s electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities are subject to operational risks that can lead to lost revenues from prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures or legal claims, liability to third parties for property damage or personal injury, failure to perform under power sales agreements or higher replacement power costs; these operational uncertainties include weather events and natural disasters, performance below expected levels, equipment breakdowns, lack of replacement equipment, inability to identify or mitigate defects and use of new or unproven technology. NEE and FPL employ derivative instruments, hedging and trading procedures, risk management tools, decommissioning funds and insurance coverage to manage commodity and financial market risks and reduce financial exposure to nuclear, storm and other hazards; however, changes in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, reductions in market liquidity, counterparty defaults, cyber attacks, terrorist acts and other disruptive events may limit their ability to generate, purchase or transmit energy, bill customers, delay development and construction of new facilities, impose additional security requirements and costs and damage reputation. Any determination by regulators not to permit timely and full recovery of restoration or other costs, any reduction or elimination of governmental incentives that support renewable energy, or an inability to access capital and credit markets on reasonable terms could increase cost of capital, impede funding of liquidity and growth objectives, require posting of additional collateral under guarantee arrangements and ultimately impair NEE’s and FPL’s ability to preserve service continuity, maintain reliability and support future investments. Additionally, NEE’s holding company structure depends on upstream dividends from its subsidiaries and the availability of credit support and insurance from external providers, while guarantee obligations to partners and contractual commitments may require NEE to provide or post funds at precisely the time they are needed to respond to financial, regulatory or operational crises.

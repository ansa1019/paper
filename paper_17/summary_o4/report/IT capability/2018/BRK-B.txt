Berkshire’s board of directors has established and continually monitors a formal succession plan whereby current subsidiary managers have been identified as capable successors to key personnel, helping to mitigate operational risks arising from the unavailability of critical individuals. The Company operates on an unusually decentralized basis, with minimal corporate-headquarters involvement in day-to-day activities and senior management retaining responsibility only for major capital allocation, investment activities and selection of operating chief executives, thereby enabling agile local responses to changing market and regulatory environments. Recognizing the imperative of operational continuity under adverse conditions, Berkshire maintains ample liquidity—holding substantial cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury securities—and insists on safety over yield, while implementing business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to preserve service delivery and positive adjustment in the face of cyber attacks, natural catastrophes or capital-market disruptions. Risk is shared across its diversified insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries through both underwriting and investing activities, with catastrophe loss modeling, reserve development reviews and reinsurance structures designed to align expected loss emergence patterns with actual outcomes, thereby strengthening the organization’s ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve performance despite internal or external disturbances. In its railroad and utilities businesses, the Company commits significant ongoing capital investments to ensure network reliability over extended periods, secures access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates, and continually adapts to evolving laws, regulations and technological mandates, all of which reinforce its capacity to withstand environmental perturbations and reconfigure operational trajectories toward future objectives.

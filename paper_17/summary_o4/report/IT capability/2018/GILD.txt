The Company acknowledges that it “cannot predict or identify all” potential risk factors and may need to “scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development” if adverse events occur, underscoring its capacity to reallocate resources and adjust operations under stress. It describes its use of forward currency exchange contracts “to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales” and certain monetary assets, reflecting a structured risk-mitigation mechanism against market fluctuations. The report details supply-chain dependencies on third-party manufacturers, apheresis centers, wholesalers and distributors and warns that “failure to comply with regulations or to remedy deficiencies” could “impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties” and “delay regulatory approvals,” illustrating an ongoing emphasis on operational continuity and compliance. It notes that “adverse changes in economic conditions, increased competition or other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories,” which would “reduce…orders from wholesalers and, consequently, the wholesalers’ orders from us, even if end user demand has not changed,” highlighting vigilance toward fragmented market pressures. The Company further outlines strategic initiatives—“business acquisitions, licensing arrangements, strategic collaborations or disposal of our assets”—as part of its long-term planning to enhance its pipeline and redistribute capabilities in response to shifting opportunities and constraints. It also flags legislative and regulatory uncertainties—from revised rebate statutes to pricing-transparency mandates—that require adaptive pricing strategies and contract terms. In addressing broader business health, the Company discusses maintaining “capital resources and cash flows” to support current operations “for the foreseeable future,” conducting periodic reviews of legal contingencies and tax exposures, and investing in cyber-security and disaster-preparedness measures to protect information systems from “service interruption or destruction” and guard against data breaches. These disclosures collectively reflect the maintenance of “positive adjustment under challenging conditions,” the preservation of organizational functioning amid internal and external disruptions, and the continual reconfiguration of resources, processes and collaborations to sustain performance and resilience.

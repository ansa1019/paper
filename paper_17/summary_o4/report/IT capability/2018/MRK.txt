Merck’s disclosures highlight its dependence on complex information technology systems for critical operations and acknowledge the June 2017 cyber-attack that disrupted manufacturing, research and sales worldwide, causing order backlogs and unfavorable sales impacts of approximately $260 million in 2017 and $150 million in 2018 and triggering remediation and accelerated manufacturing-variance costs of $285 million in 2017. In response, the company has implemented measures to further enhance and modernize its IT infrastructure and is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to bolster its resiliency against similar future cyber-attacks, not only to protect against intentional or accidental disruptions but also to improve the speed of recovery and enable continued business operations to the greatest extent possible during any recovery period. Merck also maintains contingency plans for natural disasters—such as the impact of Hurricane Maria on its Puerto Rico manufacturing plant—and geopolitical events—such as Brexit negotiations—to manage external pressures, preserve operational continuity and reconfigure talent, facilities and supply-chain resources under adverse conditions, while carrying insurance, monitoring risks and leveraging business-continuity and risk-mitigation strategies to absorb strain and sustain performance despite unexpected internal or external disturbances.

Operational resilience is supported by a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, including near real-time replication of production environments and customer data in separate facilities and the use of alternate facilities or arrangements for certain offerings, while persistent mitigation of cybersecurity and infrastructure threats is pursued through our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, and escalation and response protocols regularly reviewed by the board of directors, audit committee and executive management. Reliance on third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and a broad ecosystem of hardware and software vendors creates potential for system strains, unanticipated service interruptions, performance degradation and liability in the event of breaches, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, administrative actions or regulatory changes, risks that we address with capacity planning, infrastructure investments, alternate service provisions, and strategic resource allocation to preserve continuity of service delivery. Significant growth in customer base and personnel has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure and supporting our existing and growing customer base may require substantial additional investments to scale our operations, increase productivity, train and retain employees, and enhance technical support, all of which are intended to enable the organization to absorb internal and external pressures, maintain functioning under challenging conditions, and adapt effectively to evolving technology, market demands and regulatory requirements.

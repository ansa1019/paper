KKR’s annual report discloses a multifaceted approach to maintaining operations and protecting value under adverse conditions, including business-continuity and disaster-recovery programs designed to mitigate harm from technology or infrastructure disruptions, notwithstanding reliance on a concentrated New York office and third-party hosting vendors, and contingency planning in the event liquidity requirements exceed available liquid assets, which may force the sale of assets or the raising of debt or equity on unfavorable terms. The firm employs risk-mitigation tools such as hedging strategies and derivative transactions to limit exposure to interest-rate, foreign-exchange and commodity-price variability, although it does not hedge every currency or position, recognizing that imperfect correlation and illiquidity can hamper these protections. KKR manages diversified liquidity sources, including revolving credit facilities, bond issuances and uncalled capital commitments across its private markets, public markets and co-investment vehicles, and retains credit support obligations and “clawback” provisions under its fund agreements to preserve its balance sheet integrity. Governance and operational risk processes address errors in trade execution, valuations and cybersecurity threats, and proposed SEC rules would require formal continuity and transition plans, underscoring ongoing efforts to maintain continuity of services for clients and investors while adapting to evolving regulatory and market perturbations.

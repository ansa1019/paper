Our risk disclosures emphasize the necessity of maintaining operational integrity and performance despite internal and external pressures, including economic volatility from credit market disruptions, currency fluctuations, energy‐cost variability and slowed global growth that may constrain customer demand and supplier financing, as well as industry‐specific shifts in healthcare legislation, reimbursement policies, trade agreements, tariffs and Brexit‐related import/export restrictions that require rapid strategic and logistical adjustments. We recognize the complexity of scaling and sustaining manufacturing—where component shortages, sole‐source dependencies, quality control challenges and import/export constraints can impede production—and the critical need for contingency planning, flexible resource allocation and inventory management to preserve business continuity. Potential facility disruptions from natural disasters, epidemics or cyber breaches highlight our reliance on robust disaster recovery protocols, secure information systems and incident response capabilities. Our reliance on distributor networks abroad, the management of operating lease and usage‐based financing programs, and the modulation of service contract offerings demand continuous risk mitigation, credit oversight, and adaptive contract and pricing strategies. Compliance with evolving quality system regulations, product registration and post‐market surveillance requirements in multiple jurisdictions—including timely corrective actions, recalls and field service support—underpins our ability to sustain market access and safeguard patient safety. Exposure to legal and regulatory challenges—from anti‐kickback and privacy statutes to intellectual property litigation and product liability claims—necessitates a dedicated legal framework and insurance approaches to shield our operations and financial stability. Cross‐functional collaboration in research, development, training and global market expansion fosters organizational learning, absorptive capacity and innovation, enabling us to reconfigure product portfolios, optimize training pathways for surgical teams and integrate advanced instrumentation in response to dynamic clinical and economic demands. Collectively, these disclosures portray a systemic perspective on resilience—drawing upon risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, strategic foresight and inter‐organizational coordination to preserve positive adjustment, continuity of service and competitive advantage under challenging conditions.

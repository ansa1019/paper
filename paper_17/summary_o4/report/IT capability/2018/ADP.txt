We routinely encounter and address a wide range of complex risks—from changes in laws and regulations to cyber threats and natural disasters—and have implemented comprehensive risk-based programs, policies and procedures to monitor, review, upgrade and enhance our compliance and operational controls. Our businesses depend critically on payroll, financial, accounting and other data-processing systems, and we maintain disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect against natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communications failures, data-center or vendor disruptions and systemic shutdowns in the banking industry, while recognizing that such preparations may not fully prevent or mitigate interruptions, data loss or damage to our facilities and reputation. We devote significant resources to safeguard and regularly update our information security programs, host applications across both company-operated and third-party data centers with contingency plans for vendor failures, and have obtained binding corporate rules under the GDPR to preserve system integrity, service continuity and regulatory compliance. To support operational flexibility and financial strength, we employ a laddered client funds investment strategy with maturities out to five or ten years, maintain credit quality, exposure and maturity limits, and utilize short‐term financing arrangements—including reverse repurchase agreements, a commercial paper program and committed credit facilities—to satisfy funding requirements for client obligations and to average our way through interest‐rate cycles, thereby enhancing our ability to absorb strain and preserve core functioning under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

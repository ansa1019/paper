The Company discloses that its business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and that additional risks not presently known or currently deemed immaterial may also impair its operations. It warns that intense competitive pressures or its inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, including through the delivery of a superior customer experience or maintenance of effective marketing, advertising or promotional programs, could adversely affect its prices, margins, demand for products and services and market share. The Company acknowledges that it may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations or trends, including evolving demographics and unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters, which could adversely affect customer relationships, reputation, demand and market share. Its strategic initiatives, including the One Home Depot interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives, require significant investments in new processes, systems and support and the failure to choose the right investments or implement them at the right pace could disrupt operations in the near term and adversely affect competitive position and financial condition. The Company relies extensively on information technology systems, some managed by third-party providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data; these systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and design or usage errors, and despite efforts to maintain and update these systems, errors, interruptions, delays or cessations of service could significantly disrupt operations and be costly and time-consuming to remedy. Disruptions in its customer-facing technology systems could impair its interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. A disruption within its logistics or supply chain network resulting from weather-related events, natural disasters, trade policy changes, tariffs, strikes or military conflicts could adversely affect its ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, impair customer demand, increase supply chain costs or damage its reputation. The Company has implemented and regularly reviews and updates its systems, processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer, associate, supplier and company data and to prevent data loss; however the evolving nature of data protection and cybersecurity threats and the complex regulatory environment may render these measures inadequate, potentially resulting in substantial costs, reputational damage, litigation and enforcement actions. It further discloses that natural disasters and extreme weather conditions can affect consumer spending, disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers and supply chain and distribution networks, and impair information systems, potentially causing interruption to operations, increased costs or losses of property, equipment or inventory. The Company also notes that its ability to timely and efficiently access products that meet quality standards depends on identifying and developing relationships with qualified suppliers and managing strategic alliances and exclusive relationships; political instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, supplier financial instability or noncompliance and other factors beyond control could adversely affect inventory availability and its strategy to differentiate products. Changes in economic conditions, housing and home improvement markets, political climate, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, availability of financing and general economic uncertainty could negatively impact customer confidence, demand, costs of doing business and financial performance. Despite the Companyâ€™s belief that its current cash position, access to debt markets, commercial paper capacity and cash flow from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and debt obligations, it cautions that working capital requirements are influenced by seasonality, inventory management, timing of cash receipts and vendor payment terms, and that compliance with debt covenants, changes in laws and regulations and execution of strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and integrations, involve significant uncertainty and require substantial judgment.

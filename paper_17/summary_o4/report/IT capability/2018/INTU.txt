Our annual report emphasizes that our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is rooted in continuous adaptation to technological change and global trends in customer access, successful introduction of new and enhanced products, services and business models, and the allocation of significant resources to developing the skills, tools and capabilities required to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies.  We describe ongoing investments in our information technology infrastructure, privacy and security capabilities and high-availability network systems and note that failures of our or our third-party service providers’ data centers, cloud services (including AWS), internal or external systems, or interruptions during critical peak periods could impair operational continuity, disrupt service delivery, harm our reputation and materially damage financial results.  We acknowledge the vulnerabilities posed by a broad spectrum of adverse events—from cyberattacks, natural or man-made disasters, and human error to third-party partner failures and sole-source dependencies—and the critical need for disaster recovery plans, insurance coverage, risk control mechanisms, and collaboration with industry and government (including enhanced security measures with state and federal agencies) to mitigate those risks and preserve our organizational health, system integrity and business continuity.

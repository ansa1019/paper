Mastercard’s disclosures describe a suite of risk management and continuity measures that support its ability to maintain operations and service levels under internal or external pressures, including “risk management policies and procedures, collateral requirements, participant default policies and procedures, the ability to complete timely switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resource requirements,” the establishment of a business continuity program “to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies,” and ongoing investments in security controls, cyber-attack mitigation and operational capacity to preserve system integrity and performance even in the face of technology malfunctions, service interruptions, natural disasters, terrorism, power outages or infrastructure failures.  The company further notes that its real-time account-based payment network is designated as critical infrastructure, subject to heightened oversight and requiring specialized operational resilience capabilities to manage security vulnerabilities, potential service outages and regulatory interventions, and that any prolonged outage could have “quickly escalating impacts” on reputation and customer confidence.  Mastercard also acknowledges settlement and counterparty guarantees that create credit and liquidity exposures, the risk that concurrent failures could exceed available resources, and contractual indemnification obligations that must be managed to protect its financial health.  It highlights the need to work with third-party providers for global data transmission, calls out the importance of internal and external compliance mechanisms to counter fraud and evolving privacy regulations, and recognizes that economic, political, currency and regulatory volatility could reduce transaction volumes, constrain resource allocation and impair its capacity to adapt and recover under adverse conditions.

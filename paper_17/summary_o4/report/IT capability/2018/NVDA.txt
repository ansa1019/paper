In assessing our organizational resilience, we recognize that system security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce expected revenue and increase expenses, requiring us to continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features. We may experience interruptions, delays, service cessation and loss of customers that adversely impact order fulfillment and critical functions, leading to lower margins and reputational harm. Our operations face business disruptions from natural and man-made disasters—earthquakes, tsunamis, cyber-attacks, epidemics or climate change—which could result in significant losses, elevated costs and substantial recovery time to fully resume operations, particularly given the geographic concentration of our headquarters, R&D, data centers and suppliers near seismic and other risk-prone areas. We rely on forecasts of customer demand to manufacture GPUs and Tegra processors, and misestimations may lead to excess or obsolete inventory, higher costs or supply constraints, while failure to anticipate changing market needs and adapt strategies in a timely manner could decrease demand, impair market share and undermine financial performance. Competition and unanticipated shifts in industry standards may render our products incompatible or less competitive, necessitating the introduction of new offerings and design wins to sustain growth. Errors or defects discovered post-shipment can lead to warranty, repair or recall costs, brand damage and diverted engineering resources to remediate issues. Dependence on third-party foundries and subcontractors for wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging reduces our control over product quality, yields and delivery schedules, while delays in software development tools or design cycles can impede product launches, erode revenue and weaken customer relationships. We seek to ensure liquidity and operational flexibility through cash reserves, marketable securities, credit facilities and commercial paper programs, and we plan resource allocation—such as returning capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends—while evaluating strategic investments and acquisitions, recognizing the complexity, integration challenges and potential diversion of capital they entail. These measures collectively reflect our focus on risk mitigation, operational continuity, adaptation to disruptions and preservation of performance integrity under challenging conditions.

Lowe’s disclosures emphasize its structured risk management process, administered by the chief financial officer and supported by periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks and to develop risk mitigation controls and procedures. The company warns that it may be unable to adapt its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address changing customer shopping habits, demands and demographics or to realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives, noting that its future success depends on the ability to identify and respond to economic, social, style and other trends that affect consumer preferences across merchandise categories and service offerings and to implement change, growth and productivity initiatives successfully or risk negative impacts on customer relationships, demand, market share and results of operations. Lowe’s further explains that its strategic initiatives to achieve an omni-channel sales and marketing presence require delivery of complex programs demanding integrated planning, prioritization and sequencing of initiatives, new competencies across many positions and adaptation and learning of new skills and capabilities by management, employees and contractors, without which it may not realize full benefits or expand market access. The company underscores the resilience of its technology-enabled operations, warning that cybersecurity incidents, evolving regulations, unauthorized access, system errors, power outages, catastrophic events or an inability to pre-empt or detect ever-evolving cyber-attacks could result in data loss, business interruptions, reputational damage, remediation costs and regulatory or litigation exposure and that customer-facing technology systems, including websites and mobile apps, must perform reliably and have disaster recovery plans to maintain operational continuity and customer confidence. Supply-chain and vendor resilience is highlighted through the risk that the failure of key vendors or service providers, political or economic instability in source countries, labor unrest, pandemics, natural disasters, transport capacity constraints, trade policy changes, tariffs, currency fluctuations or other external disruptions could impair product availability or increase costs, and that the inability to effectively manage relationships with selected suppliers or third-party installers may lead to operational, legal and reputational risks. The disclosures also cite the need to comply with a complex and changing regulatory landscape, manage self-insured exposures for workers’ compensation, liability and health claims, and oversee legal proceedings, any of which could require significant resources and affect liquidity. Finally, Lowe’s outlines its strategies for maintaining financial and operational flexibility—through capital expenditures, inventory and working-capital management, access to commercial paper and revolving credit facilities, share repurchases, dividend payments, impairment testing of long-lived assets and goodwill, and review of lease obligations—to preserve organizational continuity, resource allocation and resilience under nominal, extreme or exceptional adverse conditions.

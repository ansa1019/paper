Goldman Sachs’s enterprise risk management framework is governed by the board and its risk committee and implemented through a three-lines-of-defense structure—revenue-producing units, independent risk oversight and internal audit—that systematically identifies, assesses, monitors and limits risks, thereby preserving organizational health and performance under stress. Capital planning and stress-testing processes, including firm-designed and regulatorily mandated scenarios, are employed to forecast liquidity, collateral and capital needs, with a contingency funding plan and a global core liquid assets portfolio maintained to pre-fund estimated outflows in a crisis or period of market stress. The firmwide asset liability committee manages diversified balance sheet composition, tenor and funding sources globally, while the global business resilience committee and operational risk management functions oversee business resilience policies, controls, systems and processes to ensure operational continuity in the face of infrastructure disruptions, cyber attacks, pandemics or geopolitical events. Independent model risk management validates models used for valuation, risk measurement and capital calculations, and regular scenario analyses, including resolution and recovery planning, enable timely reconfiguration of resources, crisis response, and maintenance of critical services, reflecting a systemic perspective on adaptability, risk mitigation and performance maintenance under challenging conditions.

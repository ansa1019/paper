The 10-K discloses that the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity depends on “continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs, including, but not limited to, process line-width, additional 3D memory layers, additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), architecture, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and yield,” and on its capacity to “make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology,” as reflected in a planned $10.5 billion 2019 capital expenditure program. It emphasizes joint development partnerships and its IMFT venture with Intel to advance NAND and 3D XPoint technologies as strategic initiatives, maintains an undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility and disciplined debt management, and has a $10 billion share repurchase authorization—including an accelerated share repurchase—to optimize capital structure and support operational continuity. The report acknowledges intense competition, consolidation pressures, manufacturing disruptions from power outages, equipment failures, raw-material shortages, tariffs and trade tensions, environmental events, and supply chain constraints, and notes diversification of suppliers, multi-sourced raw materials, and contingency planning as mechanisms to mitigate risk and sustain business continuity. It further addresses the necessity of attracting and retaining highly skilled personnel, protecting intellectual property, managing long lead-times for system-level products to avoid excess inventory, and monitoring legislative and regulatory developments—such as U.S. tax reform, repatriation and foreign minimum taxes, and Singaporean incentive arrangements—to safeguard liquidity and enable positive adjustment under challenging internal and external conditions.

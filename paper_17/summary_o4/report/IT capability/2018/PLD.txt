Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems, our systems remain vulnerable to energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks that could materially disrupt our operations. We attempt to mitigate foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we have significant investments, thereby providing a natural hedge, and by entering into derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges to offset translation adjustments on our underlying net assets. We generally carry earthquake, hurricane and flood hazard insurance on properties located in areas historically subject to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles, evaluating coverage annually through outside consultants and, in specific cases, electing to self-insure when commercially reasonable, while acknowledging that uninsured losses or losses in excess of insured limits could result in significant loss of capital and future revenues and impair our ability to satisfy debt obligations. Our business could be adversely impacted by deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, and any material weakness could result in misstatements or restatements of financial statements. Disruptions in global capital and credit markets, difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations, volatility in currencies and exchange restrictions, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs or trade wars, and political instability all pose external pressures that require operational flexibility, risk mitigation strategies and resource reconfiguration to preserve or improve functioning under adversity. We are exposed to the potential physical risks of future climate change and extreme weather events, which could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral. Our credit facilities and debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our flexibility, and adverse changes in our credit ratings could increase borrowing costs or restrict access to capital, potentially forcing reliance on third-party sources or short-term borrowing to meet REIT distribution requirements. In addition, we face environmental liabilities under federal, state and local laws for the removal or remediation of hazardous substances, often imposed without regard to fault, and may be subject to third-party claims or governmental fines, reinforcing the need for ongoing risk assessment, emergency management planning and strategic resilience mechanisms to maintain organizational integrity and performance under varying internal and external disturbances.

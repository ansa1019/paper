Starbucks discloses that it operates in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing environment in which “new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations,” and that its business continuity depends on effective incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, warning that if these plans do not resolve cybersecurity, technology or supply chain failures, food-safety incidents or other operational disruptions in an effective manner, it could cause interruptions in operations and material negative impacts on product availability, sales and financial results. The company states it continues to make “significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel” to develop and implement systems and processes designed to “anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches,” yet acknowledges “operational safeguards in place may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms,” and that “any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business.” Starbucks notes vulnerabilities in its supply chain—“interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability”—stemming from reliance on one or few suppliers of high-quality arabica coffee beans, dairy products and other commodities, exposure to trade restrictions, natural disasters, third-party logistics service failures and evolving product requirements, which could force the company “to temporarily close some stores and/or supply chain facilities, as well as recall products.” The company outlines the complexities of strategic adaptation and operational flexibility required by initiatives such as converting markets to licensed models, closing and opening stores to optimize its global footprint, integrating its acquisition of the East China joint venture, realigning segment structures under the global coffee alliance and advancing digital, delivery and loyalty programs—all of which necessitate the reconfiguration of resources, maintenance of quality standards across diverse markets and the agility to reconstitute trajectories in immediate response to disruptive events. To mitigate financial volatility and sustain its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning, Starbucks actively manages its cash and investment portfolios, uses commodity hedges and financial derivatives to manage price, currency and interest rate risks, and maintains revolving credit and commercial paper facilities, reflecting its approach to maintaining integrity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

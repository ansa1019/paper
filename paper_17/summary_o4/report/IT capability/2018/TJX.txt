The Company’s risk disclosures and management discussion describe a multifaceted approach to preserving performance under challenging conditions through adaptive resource allocation and risk mitigation. Its off-price model—“operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns”—entrusts merchants “to effectively react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market” and requires “flexibility in our allocation of floor space” and inventory mix to maintain customer responsiveness. The enterprise routinely employs “inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates” and maintains “policies, procedures, and controls designed to reduce the risk of data security compromises and information technology failures or disruptions,” recognizing that the “ongoing integrity, security and consistent operations” of information systems and backup capabilities are critical to operational continuity. Contingency planning for “natural or other disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and other extreme weather” and supply-chain interruptions underscores its commitment to business continuity, while the Brexit readiness strategy—management having “evaluated a range of possible outcomes, sought to identify areas of concern and implemented strategies to mitigate them,” including a “plan to realign our European division’s supply chain” and “established resources and systems to support this plan”—demonstrates systemic resilience and strategic foresight. Proactive forecasts of customer demand (“we base our purchases of inventory, in part, on our sales forecasts”), rigorous liquidity management—“existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs”—and ongoing investment in technology systems “to accurately anticipate our current and future information technology needs and successfully develop and implement appropriate systems” further reinforce the Company’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt to environmental perturbations, and sustain positive adjustment under internal and external pressures.

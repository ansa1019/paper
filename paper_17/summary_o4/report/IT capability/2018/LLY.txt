We employ a portfolio‐based approach to sustain continuity and maintain performance under internal or external pressures, including the continuous development and introduction of new products and indications sufficient to cover research and development costs and replace revenues lost to patent expirations or competitive entry; the diversification of our therapeutic pipeline and geographic mix; the maintenance of robust liquidity through cash and cash equivalents, committed credit facilities, and prudent capital allocation, including debt management, share repurchases, and dividend continuity; and the execution of strategic acquisitions, collaborations, and asset rationalizations to reconfigure our resource base and strengthen our capabilities. We self‐insure and accrue for product liability claims, engage in proactive risk management through derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency and interest rate exposure, and implement measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize operational risks in our complex information technology systems, infrastructure, and supply chains—including reliance on third parties and sole‐source materials—to preserve or improve organizational functioning amid potential service interruptions, security breaches, or manufacturing disruptions. Our business continuity is further supported by comprehensive tax planning and compliance processes to address changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, ongoing monitoring of government pricing, reimbursement pressures, and trade disruptions, and efforts to reduce cost structure through restructuring and other special charges, all designed to absorb strain, facilitate positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and emerge stronger following adversity.

The company discloses that its broad international operations expose it to external pressures such as protectionism, trade tensions, macroeconomic weakness and Brexit risks, which “may affect the general economic climate and our performance,” and it must “respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures” in the face of intense competition, while managing cybersecurity threats that “could compromise our information technology networks” and “cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations.” It acknowledges that its global footprint subjects it to political, social, economic and health conditions, terrorism or hostile acts, and “natural events such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations,” as well as supply chain and manufacturing risks from “third parties” whose operations may be affected by quality excursions, financial market instability, political or natural events or limited access to raw materials. To address fluctuations in demand, it endeavors to “match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders,” but notes that inaccurate forecasting can lead to “inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory.” During the semiconductor market downturn in late 2018, it remained “disciplined with our operating plan and expenses, while focusing on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages.” Its business model rests on four sustainable competitive advantages, including investments in in-house manufacturing technologies “to ensure a consistent supply of products,” a “broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors,” global market channels to reach approximately 100,000 customers, and the “diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions” that deliver high terminal value. It commits over $1 billion annually to research and development, plans capacity expansions to support growth, and relies on cash flow from operations—supplemented by cash and short-term investments and a $2 billion revolving credit facility—as its “primary source of liquidity” to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and debt-related payments, asserting that it “believe[s] we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our … business requirements for at least the next 12 months.” It maintains valuation allowances for inventory obsolescence and collects concessions from distributors based on historical data, recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery, and records allowances for product returns and special pricing arrangements, all as part of its risk mitigation and operational continuity measures.

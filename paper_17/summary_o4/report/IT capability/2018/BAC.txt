Our filings describe a comprehensive framework designed to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by integrating risk identification, measurement, monitoring and control across our operations.  We maintain contingency plans, including capital contingency and financial recovery plans that define scenarios, monitoring, escalation, actions and routines to support our businesses under “expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs,” even in severe market stress.  Our resolution strategy, underpinned by “single point of entry” intercompany arrangements and preferred holding-company liquidity contingencies, seeks to preserve system integrity by providing “certain key operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress.”  We diversify funding and liquidity sources, manage “diminished access to secured financing markets” and deposit withdrawals, and maintain “global liquidity sources” of cash and high-quality, liquid securities.  Our risk appetite statement, approved by the board and implemented by the enterprise risk committee, articulates tolerances for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, operational and reputational risks.  Business continuity is supported by centralized model risk and liquidity governance, by our Enterprise Model Risk Committee’s validation of scoring and pricing models, and by monitoring of “previously uncorrelated indicators” that may become correlated under stress.  Operational and cybersecurity risks are managed through controls, training, backup systems and incident response plans, as we acknowledge that “we may not be able to anticipate all cyber-attacks or information or security breaches.”  To hedge interest rate and foreign exchange exposure, we employ swaps, futures and options and perform daily gap analysis, var and stress testing, while our allowance for credit losses is based on quantitative loss-forecast models augmented by qualitative overlays that consider emerging economic conditions, loan seasoning and portfolio concentrations.  Strategic resilience is further bolstered by an annual internal capital adequacy assessment (ICAAP), scenario-testing of balance sheet, earnings and capital under baseline and adverse paths, and by “sound risk management” that balances risk-adjusted returns and allows us to “serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders” in dynamic environments.

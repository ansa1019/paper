The report acknowledges that interruptions in data and information technology systems supporting demand and supply planning and inventory control, as well as broader business disruptions—including those arising from climate change, natural disasters, extreme weather, energy shortages, public health crises, transportation delays and port strikes—may impede the company’s ability to deliver products and preserve operating continuity; it further recognizes that its reliance on a concentrated base of independent contract manufacturers creates risks of delayed or non-delivery, quality shortfalls and labor cost inflation that threaten supply chain reliability; that seasonality and unpredictable shifts in consumer demand can lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, necessitating off-price clearances or expedited, higher-cost transportation; that exposure to foreign currency volatility and changes in trade policy is managed through a centrally administered foreign exchange program leveraging natural offsets, standardized exchange-rate assignments, hedging instruments and factory currency adjustment indices; that credit risk concentration among a small number of large retailers and counterparty default risk in hedging and financing activities can adversely affect liquidity; and that failures or inadequacies in distribution centers, digital commerce platforms, data security and internal controls could disrupt customer engagement, financial reporting and brand reputation—risks the company seeks to mitigate through advanced risk assessment, committed credit facilities, business interruption insurance, strategic inventory management, digital and physical infrastructure investments and confidentiality and compliance programs designed to maintain integrity and performance under internal or external pressures.

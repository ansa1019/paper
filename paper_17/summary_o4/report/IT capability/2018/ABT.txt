Abbott demonstrates organizational resilience through investments in its systems and technology to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption and through ongoing monitoring of those systems for current or potential threats and regulatory changes. The company enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate exposures, regularly analyzes historical rebate trends and adjusts reserves to reflect changing program terms, and maintains business continuity by integrating acquisitions, such as St. Jude Medical and Alere, through cost‐improvement and efficiency initiatives while executing restructuring plans and corrective action programs in response to regulatory inspections or warning letters. Abbott’s framework for risk mitigation includes global supply chain oversight to reconfigure operations following manufacturing or regulatory disruptions, receivables monitoring and occasional factoring to manage credit risk, engagement of actuarial and tax professionals to assess pension, post‐employment benefit and tax contingencies, and strict compliance with complex U.S. and international regulations to preserve or improve functioning despite internal or external pressures. These strategies enable Abbott to absorb strain, adapt to environmental perturbations and unexpected events, and maintain integrity and performance under challenging conditions, consistent with the scholars’ definition of organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

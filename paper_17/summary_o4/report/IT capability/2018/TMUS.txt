Consistent with scholarly definitions of organizational resilience as “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions” (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007:3418) and as an organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning in the presence of adversity, the 10-K risk factors describe a multifaceted system resilience that maintains integrity and performance under pressures, constraints, failures, errors, hazards and environmental disruptions by emphasizing continuous adaptation and resource reconfiguration. The Company identifies risks to business continuity arising from system failures and business disruptions that may allow unauthorized use or interference with the network; cyber-attacks, data breaches, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, political instability and acts of war; third-party supplier and vendor failures; technological change and spectrum scarcity; regulatory shifts and litigation; economic, political and market volatility; and operational and financial constraints imposed by debt covenants and investor expectations. In response, the Company commits to ongoing capital investments in network infrastructure—expanding and enhancing network quality, deploying 5G and low-band spectrum, upgrading to new billing systems—implementing robust risk mitigation and internal control processes, strategic initiatives such as innovation programs and service offerings, inter-organizational collaboration, contingency planning, and dynamic capabilities to adapt, recover and reconfigure trajectories toward future growth, thereby sustaining performance, operational flexibility and competitive advantage amid disruptive events.

The company’s risk-management framework explicitly recognizes that maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions requires a systemic approach to anticipating, mitigating and recovering from internal or external disturbances.  As part of this framework, the company identifies significant risk factors—ranging from foreign-currency fluctuations, political volatility, sovereign risk and economic disruptions to natural disasters, extreme weather events, labor disputes, cybersecurity breaches and operational technology failures—that may interrupt product supply, manufacturing and distribution, impede corporate financing and credit transactions or otherwise impair its business continuity.  To preserve or improve functioning despite such adversity, the company has implemented supply-chain optimizations, sole-source arrangements, extended payment-term agreements, inventory-management programs and productivity-improvement initiatives designed to streamline decision making, reduce cost of goods sold, marketing and overhead expenses, and reinvest savings in product and packaging innovation, marketing, r&d and sales coverage.  The company maintains an information and operational technology (“IT/OT”) risk-management program, supervised by IT management and reviewed by cross-functional stakeholders, which conducts ongoing threat analyses, system monitoring and updates, specialized security training and policy enhancements to bolster resilience against advanced persistent cybersecurity threats.  Business-continuity and disaster-recovery plans address potential failures of IT/OT systems, networks or third-party service providers, ensuring continuity of critical processes—ordering materials, converting materials to finished products, shipping orders and processing payments—and, should these plans prove insufficient, the company acknowledges potential reputational, competitive, operational, financial and regulatory harms.  The company further manages commodity and other cost fluctuations through sourcing decisions, pricing actions and hedging programs for currencies, interest rates and inputs, and sustains liquidity via robust operating cash flow, disciplined financing—including commercial paper programs, bank credit facilities and registered debt offerings—and strategic cash repatriation, thereby preserving operational flexibility, adaptive capacity and overall organizational resilience under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

ServiceNow’s risk disclosures indicate that maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions requires the company to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite competitive pressures, economic or geopolitical turbulence, technological disruptions, cyber-security threats and natural disasters. To this end, the company allocates significant financial and personnel resources to data center capacity, infrastructure hardware, colocation, interconnectivity, redundancy and disaster recovery, and has instituted crisis management and disaster response plans, foreign exchange hedging programs and insurance coverage to protect service availability and organizational integrity. The firm also emphasizes strategic resilience through ongoing innovation in emerging digital and cloud technologies, accurate forecasting of customer needs, efficient integration within customers’ digital environments, flexible contract structures, professional services and partner ecosystems, and continuous enhancement of security measures and operational controls. ServiceNow acknowledges that interruptions—from cyber-attacks, system defects, third-party failures, environmental hazards or regulatory changes—could impair performance, damage reputation or impose liabilities, and it seeks to mitigate such risks by diversifying locations, fortifying security defenses, establishing internal controls and dedicating resources to recover and adapt rapidly under internal or external perturbations.

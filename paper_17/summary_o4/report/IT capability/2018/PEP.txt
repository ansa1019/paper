We disclose that damage or disruption to our or third-party operations due to adverse weather, natural disasters, health epidemics, pandemics, industrial accidents, cyber incidents, acts of terrorism, supply or commodity shortages, regulatory changes or other factors beyond our control could impair our ability to make, manufacture, transport, distribute or sell products and that failure to take adequate steps to mitigate such events or to manage them effectively if they occur could adversely affect our business and require additional resources to restore operations. We describe multi-year productivity plans to simplify, harmonize and automate processes, re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, optimize our manufacturing and supply-chain footprint and simplify our organization in order to maintain performance, enhance operational flexibility and adapt more quickly to changing conditions. We discuss our efforts to address shifting consumer preferences, sustainability and packaging regulations through capital investments to increase recyclability and develop bio-based packaging, thereby reconfiguring resources and processes to preserve or improve functioning under new external constraints. We explain our large investments in network security, backup and disaster recovery, internal controls and coordination with third-party service providers in order to respond to cyberattacks or other system failures and maintain business continuity. We also describe the reorganization of our international operations and intercompany transfer of intangible assets in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, illustrating how we reconstitute and align our legal, financial and operational structures to preserve integrity and performance under new tax and regulatory frameworks.

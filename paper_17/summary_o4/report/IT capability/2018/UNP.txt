The report highlights the company’s ongoing efforts to anticipate and adapt to fluctuating demand and external pressures by continuously improving its transportation plan, adding capacity, enhancing yard and facility operations, and bolstering its ability to address surges in demand with adequate resources, while acknowledging that these measures “may not fully or adequately address any service shortcomings” when demand exceeds planned capacity. In response to network congestion and variability, the company launched Unified Plan 2020 and related G55+0 initiatives focused on “increasing reliability of our service product, reducing variability in network operations, and improving resource utilization costs,” including terminal rationalization and corridor‐specific transportation‐plan changes designed to improve network fluidity and resource allocation. A multi‐faceted safety and risk‐mitigation program—encompassing technology deployment, risk assessment, training, employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments under brands such as Total Safety Culture, Courage to Care, and UP Way—underscores its continuous‐improvement culture and its commitment to maintain operational continuity and performance under challenging conditions. The company’s liquidity and capital resource strategy, which includes operating cash flows, a receivables securitization facility, a $2 billion revolving credit line and access to commercial paper and bond markets, provides financial resilience to support ongoing renewal investments—approximately 75–80% of its $3.2 billion 2019 capital plan—while reserving the remainder for strategic capacity and technology projects. Comprehensive risk management covers severe weather and natural phenomena, cybersecurity threats, hazardous‐materials incidents, regulatory change, labor disputes, fuel‐price volatility and climate‐change impacts, demonstrating an integrated approach to preserving system integrity and performance despite adversity.

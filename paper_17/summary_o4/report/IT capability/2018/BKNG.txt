The company’s risk disclosures and management discussions identify a broad spectrum of internal and external pressures—from macro-economic downturns, currency and commodity price volatility and political uncertainties such as Brexit to sudden disruptive events including pandemics, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and regulatory or competitive shocks—and emphasize the need for business continuity, risk mitigation and adaptive resource allocation to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.  It describes maintaining redundant systems and hosting services, planning for disaster recovery, entering into derivative contracts and deploying financial hedges to protect system integrity and liquidity, while also investing in marketing, information-technology infrastructure and personnel to foster operational flexibility, systemic resilience and strategic agility across its global network.  The company acknowledges its dependence on third-party service providers, highlights the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and supply-chain contingency planning, and details cybersecurity and data-protection measures—such as encryption, authentication controls and monitoring for phishing or denial-of-service attacks—underscoring its crisis-response capabilities.  These disclosures further address the temporal mismatches inherent in seasonality and revenue recognition, evolving tax and regulatory regimes, competition from digital platforms, and litigation contingencies, all of which require dynamic forecasting, resource reconfiguration and governance adjustments to ensure organizational health and maintain performance under pressure.

UPS operates in over 220 countries and territories and faces economic cycles, regulatory changes and competitive pressures beyond its control, requiring the company to continually adjust its air and ground networks, deploy automation and technology, expand weekend operations and reconfigure capacity to absorb strain and maintain service continuity under challenging conditions.  The company mitigates fuel-price, currency and interest-rate volatility through indexed surcharges and derivative hedges, invests in information-security and disaster-recovery plans to counteract cyber-attacks or severe weather events, and sustains operational flexibility via self-insurance reserves, contractual agreements with labor and third-party carriers and facility expansions.  UPSâ€™s multi-year transformation strategy includes capital commitments for new facilities and equipment, workforce growth and network automation, funded by strong operating cash flows, access to commercial paper and long-term debt markets and disciplined dividend and share-repurchase programs, thereby preserving financial resilience and firm performance.  In managing international diversification, pension funding and legal or tax contingencies, UPS allocates resources, monitors exposures and executes strategic initiatives designed to preserve integrity and uphold positive adjustment and performance in the face of external disturbances, evolving demands and disruptive events.

Visaâ€™s compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of evolving global regulations and are continually enhanced as regulations evolve, reflecting our ability to absorb regulatory strain and adjust product offerings, services, fees and other important aspects of our business across diverse regions and regulatory regimes. We maintain policies and practices to mitigate settlement and liquidity risks, including requirements to maintain sufficient levels of capital and financial resources locally, as well as localized risk management and governance, and we indemnify issuers and acquirers for settlement losses subject to our operating rules. Our treasury policies provide guidelines to ensure adequate liquidity to meet operating expenditures, payments settlement, litigation escrow funding, contingency scenarios and planned capital investments, while also supporting dividend payments, share repurchases and investment of excess cash in available-for-sale securities designed to preserve both principal and yield. We regularly evaluate our cash flow budgets and forecasts to confirm that projected sources of liquidity, including cash on hand, cash flows from operations, our investment portfolio, revolving credit facilities and a commercial paper program, will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term needs. We devote significant resources to cybersecurity and supplier risk-management programs, business continuity planning and recovery measures to maintain critical business functions, assets and data when faced with system disruptions, errors, hazards or cyber-attacks. We assess and manage risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments to ensure integration of new employees, cultures, systems and technologies, and we analyze pension and postretirement obligations in light of funded status, discount rates and asset performance. We monitor emerging technologies, competitive pressures and client and merchant behaviors, working with third parties on co-innovation initiatives, and recognize that our ability to anticipate and adapt to environmental turbulence, business continuity challenges and regulatory or technological disruptions is fundamental to preserving system integrity, operational flexibility and performance under pressure.

Our strategy includes a set of integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry, and since 2014 we have executed transformation and process improvement efforts designed to establish a more agile and efficient operating model, enabling us to reallocate resources to fund innovative pipeline and growth opportunities and realize approximately $1.9 billion in savings.  In 2018 we broke ground on a next-generation biomanufacturing plant in Rhode Island—the first of its kind in the United States—using proven next-generation biomanufacturing capabilities to preserve a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines with a smaller footprint, reduced water and energy consumption and lower carbon emissions; our first such facility in Singapore already supports commercial-scale production for multiple countries.  In late September 2017, when Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico’s infrastructure, our commercial manufacturing facility operated on backup diesel generators until re-connection to the electric grid in January 2018, and we continue to deploy generators when power remains unreliable to safeguard product supply; nevertheless, further grid instability or other disasters could disrupt operations and materially affect our ability to supply products.  These initiatives reflect ongoing investments in operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and continuity mechanisms to preserve performance under adverse conditions.

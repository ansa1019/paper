Our annual report emphasizes that our business continuity and operational resilience depend on secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other data across our own and third-party networks, supported by significant investments in systems, processes, internal controls and disaster recovery plans—including backup facilities, key management succession planning and ongoing risk assessments—to safeguard system integrity and performance under cyber attacks, infrastructure failures, natural or man-made disasters and other disruptions.  We acknowledge that breaches, service outages or the misappropriation, destruction or unavailability of data can materially interrupt our websites, applications and data processing; damage our brand and reputation; trigger litigation, regulatory actions or financial losses; and erode customer confidence, and we recognize that our security measures, insurance, outsourcing arrangements and disaster planning may prove insufficient against evolving threats.  We regularly review and enhance our business continuity plans and monitor our reliance on third-party providers for critical data, technology, cloud infrastructure and telecommunications, knowing that their failure to perform to contractual or regulatory standards could impair our ability to allocate resources, reconfigure operations, respond to unexpected situations and maintain functioning under pressure.  Our disclosures further reflect the complexity of ensuring compliance with international laws and regulations, protecting our intellectual property, managing contingent liabilities and tax exposures, and maintaining robust internal risk mitigation mechanisms, while noting that any inability to effectively address or recover from such internal or external pressures could adversely affect our organizational health, strategic agility and capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve performance in the face of adversity.

The Company discloses that it has encountered unanticipated challenges—including supply chain constraints, automation bottlenecks and manufacturing ramp delays—that required it to reduce automation levels, introduce semi-automated or manual processes and redirect cash and management resources to remediation measures; it warns that if such process changes do not continue to be successful, or if issues arise in ramping production or in bringing new facilities such as Gigafactory Shanghai online, it could face further delays unless it addresses bottlenecks promptly and cost-effectively. It emphasizes that achieving high-volume production requires significant upfront investments, vertical integration of cell manufacturing, efficient resource deployment, recruitment and retention of skilled personnel, adoption of new technologies and flexible reconfiguration of operations. To support its rapidly growing fleet, the Company plans to scale its sales, delivery and service capabilities, expand its network of retail locations, service centers, body shops, mobile service technicians and charging infrastructure and adapt its logistics and parts distribution to changing volumes. The Company further highlights its ongoing efforts to secure and diversify suppliers, forecast and synchronize component purchases to production requirements, manage the residual, financing and credit risks of its leasing programs, maintain liquidity through financing facilities and equity offerings, and comply with debt covenants and regulatory requirements. It also commits to continuously expanding and improving its information technology systems, cybersecurity measures, environmental and safety procedures and emergency-management protocols to protect against operational disruptions, breaches and external pressures, while recognizing that failure to secure additional funds, manage indebtedness or adhere to legal, regulatory and labor conditions could impair its ability to sustain operations, maintain continuity under internal or external variations, and preserve performance in challenging conditions.

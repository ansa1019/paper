In the 10-K, the company discloses that its operations depend critically on the reliable receipt, storage, processing and transmission of sensitive information and that any unauthorized intrusion, network disruption or service interruption—whether from software defects, cyberattacks, human error or natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or terrorist acts—could compromise system integrity, continuity, security and client trust, trigger costly litigation, regulatory scrutiny and financial sanctions, and lead clients to defect to alternative providers. Management warns that failure to adapt products and services to ongoing technological change, evolving client expectations and intensifying competitive pressures—including from well-funded new entrants, in-house capabilities of large clients and an industry experiencing consolidations that may narrow its client base—could restrict its ability to retain and grow revenue, thus necessitating strategic resource reallocation and continual investment in innovation. The firm commits significant resources to upgrade its technology infrastructure, enhance information security controls and maintain a robust compliance program in response to a heightened regulatory environment that may require contract modifications, additional legal and operational investments, and could, if not addressed, result in litigation, reputation damage and operational constraints. Integration of acquired businesses is described as a key strategic priority that may disrupt business processes, divert resources and demands retention of specialized personnel to avoid delays and ensure continuity of service. Active portfolio management—including the acquisition of complementary businesses to achieve scale, diversification and digital leadership, divestiture of non-strategic assets, enterprise system consolidation, and targeted innovation and operational effectiveness initiatives—is presented as central to the company’s capacity to absorb strain, preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, mitigate risk, maintain performance and emerge stronger from challenging events.

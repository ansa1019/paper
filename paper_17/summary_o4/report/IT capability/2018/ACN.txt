Accenture’s annual report identifies that its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is tested by “volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions,” which can undermine business confidence, client spending, and make it more difficult “to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans,” as well as require rapid reconfiguration of “services and solutions” to respond to “ongoing changes in technology and offerings,” including digital, cloud, artificial intelligence, automation and other disruptive technological developments. The Company underscores its dependence on balanced global workforce deployment, ability “to hire or reskill, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people” and to rebalance resources through “involuntary terminations” where necessary, to ensure operational flexibility and preserve its “competitive advantage” and organizational functioning across global delivery centers. It further highlights risks to operational continuity posed by its reliance on complex information technology networks, business continuity and “disaster recovery plans may not be effective,” and evolving cybersecurity threats that could disrupt systems, interrupt communications and lead to unauthorized disclosure, all of which demand robust crisis response and emergency management strategies. To mitigate financial strain from foreign currency fluctuations and funding constraints, Accenture employs hedging programs, diversified borrowing facilities and maintains significant cash reserves. The report also emphasizes comprehensive legal, regulatory and compliance controls—covering anticorruption, data privacy (including GDPR) and government contracting audits—to protect system integrity and organizational health. Finally, the Company describes its approach to alliance management, strategic acquisitions and divestitures, in which it must “identify and respond to continuous changes in technology,” integrate and “institutionalize our knowledge” and reconstitute capabilities post-disruption to sustain performance, adapt to environmental perturbations and emerge stronger from adversity.

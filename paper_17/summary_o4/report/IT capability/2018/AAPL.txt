The company describes a broad set of measures and the attendant risks related to maintaining operations and performance under adverse conditions, reflecting core tenets of organizational resilience. It devotes significant resources to business continuity and disaster recovery planning, invests in system redundancy, and maintains continuity measures to address information technology system failures, network disruptions, natural or man-made disasters, and supply chain interruptions, while acknowledging these measures may be ineffective or inadequate for all eventualities. The company has made prepayments to and invested in manufacturing process equipment at its outsourcing partners, entered into manufacturing purchase obligations to secure component supply, accrues reserves for purchase commitment cancellation fees and records write-downs for obsolete or excess inventory, and regularly reviews long-lived assets for impairment to preserve operational integrity. To mitigate financial and operational uncertainties, it uses derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures, implements procedures to monitor and limit credit risk on trade and vendor receivables, and maintains insurance coverage for product liability, data security breaches and other contingencies, although coverage may prove insufficient. The company has established policies, procedures and controls to ensure compliance with extensive domestic and international laws and regulations, and it devotes substantial resources to network and data security—using encryption, authentication technologies and continuous monitoring, including account freezes under suspicious circumstances—to protect confidential information. It maintains liquidity through substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, plans capital expenditures for data centers, corporate and retail facilities, and employs a diversified financing strategy, including commercial paper and term debt, while recognizing its reliance on single or limited sources of supply, outsourcing relationships and key personnel may exacerbate risks to supply continuity, operational flexibility and the preservation of performance under pressure.

Charles Schwab’s enterprise risk management framework is designed to preserve or improve organizational functioning under internal or external disturbances by identifying and assessing operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks, measuring and monitoring them against defined risk-appetite metrics, and mitigating them through policies, procedures, controls, testing, and insurance. A global risk committee and functional sub-committees oversee processes to detect emerging risks, monitor key risk indicators, and recommend corrective actions, while internal audit and compliance functions test and enforce controls. Operational resilience is supported by a geographically dispersed workforce, a backup-and-recovery infrastructure, routine business continuity and disaster recovery plan testing, and a formal incident management program to address unexpected system interruptions, human errors, cyber threats, or external fraud. An information security program integrates tools and technologies to protect systems, client accounts, and data, with continuous monitoring, restricted access, authentication measures, employee training, and collaboration with external agencies. Third-party risk is managed through contractual provisions, performance monitoring, and testing. Credit risk is mitigated through collateral requirements, credit limits, and ongoing monitoring; market risk is managed via interest-rate sensitivity analysis, net-interest-revenue simulation, and asset-liability management to maintain margins amid rate variability; and liquidity risk is addressed through diversified funding sources, regular stress testing, contingency funding scenarios, and early-warning indicators to ensure adequate liquidity in stressed conditions. Schwab also conducts capital stress tests against adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events and maintains a capital contingency plan, reviewed annually, to address low-rate inflows or forced asset sales under funding disruptions, thus reinforcing the firm’s capacity for positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

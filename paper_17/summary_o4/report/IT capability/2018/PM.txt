Our disclosures acknowledge that a wide range of internal and external pressures—such as natural disasters, pandemics, civil unrest, regime changes, nationalization, terrorism, conflict, currency devaluations, regulatory shifts and cybersecurity intrusions—could disrupt supply chains, manufacturing capabilities, distribution networks, information systems and staffing, potentially leading to loss of critical assets, reduction in volumes, revenues and net earnings, and impairment of our operational continuity; to mitigate these risks and preserve organizational integrity and performance under challenging conditions, we maintain backup systems and business continuity plans, regularly assess our capital structure and have repaid high-coupon debt early, adopt new accounting standards such as ASU 2014-09 with retrospective election for excise taxes, update provisional tax estimates under SAB 118 and may reallocate resources by replacing third-party manufacturers or service providers with our own capabilities, albeit at higher cost; our strategic transformation toward a smoke-free future exemplifies systemic adaptation through segmentation of operations into six reportable regions, multidisciplinary product development, state-of-the-art facilities, rigorous scientific substantiation and proactive advocacy for science-based regulatory frameworks, while our efforts to develop and commercialize reduced-risk products demand dynamic reconfiguration of resources, alignment of talent, culture transformation, knowledge absorption and adherence to evolving regulatory regimes to ensure resilience, maintain performance under pressure and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

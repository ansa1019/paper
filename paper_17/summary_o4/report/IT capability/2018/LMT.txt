Lockheed Martin’s disclosures highlight a multifaceted approach to sustaining its integrity and performance under a range of internal and external pressures, from its strategic plan to grow international sales and strengthen relationships through partnerships and joint technology efforts to the continuous capability development and delivery strategy applied to the F-35 program; the company describes its contract accounting practices as constantly identifying and monitoring technical, schedule and cost risks at the contract level, revising profit-booking rates through “risk retirements” when conditions permit, recognizing cumulative effects of contract modifications as they occur, and conducting “continual reviews” of performance, schedule, cost and requirements under oversight and budgeting processes to mitigate programmatic hazards; it also recounts structural measures such as diversifying funding sources—issuance of commercial paper under a revolving credit facility, scheduled repayment and refinancing of fixed-rate notes, use of interest rate swaps, and disciplined debt and capital expenditure management—to preserve financial flexibility and support operational continuity; pension and postretirement benefit obligations are proactively addressed through large discretionary contributions, plan freezes and insurer buy-in and buy-out transactions to lock in costs and reduce volatility; environmental remediation liabilities and receivables are periodically reevaluated and recorded in accordance with government regulations to maintain resource allocation and compliance; and the company’s capital deployment initiatives—including a $1 billion increase to its share repurchase program and a 10 percent dividend increase—are presented as means to reinforce stakeholder confidence and sustain adaptive resource generation in a turbulent market environment.

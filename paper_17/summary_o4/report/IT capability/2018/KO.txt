The Coca-Cola Company’s 2018 10-K discloses a broad array of organizational processes and strategic capabilities that underpin its ability to absorb strain and maintain integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances.  Its stated objective “to use our formidable assets—our brands, financial strength, unrivaled distribution system, global reach, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and associates—to achieve long-term sustainable growth” and its disciplined growth priorities, including infrastructure investments to drive volume and shared value refranchising initiatives, reflect a systemic perspective and future orientation toward positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  The company emphasizes business continuity and risk mitigation through comprehensive water risk management and stewardship frameworks—incorporating water use efficiency, wastewater treatment, shared watershed protection efforts and community engagement—and through sustainable sourcing commitments with farmers, suppliers and partners to address ingredient quality and quantity challenges.  It strengthens operational flexibility and competitive advantage via ongoing productivity and reinvestment initiatives, digital transformation, integrated quality management programs that “continually measure all operations against the same stringent standards,” and commodity-price hedging to manage the impacts of price volatility.  Governance and accounting policies support adaptability by requiring recoverability and impairment tests for assets, goodwill and equity method investments based on discounted cash flow models and management assumptions that mirror hypothetical market participants.  Liquidity and capital resources are managed through an extensive commercial paper program, backup credit facilities and active debt-capital management to ensure the company can reconfigure its balance sheet, meet contractual obligations and fund dividends and capital expenditures even in extreme or exceptional environments.  Variable consideration estimates under the new revenue recognition standard and inter-organizational collaboration with bottling partners further enable resilience by aligning incentives, sharing risk, and deploying resources to respond effectively to evolving consumer preferences, market disruptions and environmental turbulence.

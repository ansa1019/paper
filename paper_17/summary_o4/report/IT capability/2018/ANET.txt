Our disclosures describe how rapid growth and evolving market conditions have placed strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure, requiring us to manage an increasingly complex array of internal systems and processes—including hardware and software development, contract manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, fulfillment and support—to maintain business continuity and organizational functioning under pressure. We explain that our success depends on our ability to manage growth effectively by increasing employee productivity, hiring, training and retaining new employees, improving operational, financial and management controls, enhancing reporting processes and implementing more extensive and integrated business information systems to absorb strain and preserve performance. We recognize that failure to adapt our systems and processes or to detect and correct deficiencies may disrupt operations, impair customer relationships and diminish forecasting accuracy, jeopardizing our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We further acknowledge that the rapid evolution of the cloud networking market and changing customer needs impose external pressures that require continuous innovation and risk mitigation through new product introductions, development of enhanced features and timely transitions, all of which demand resource allocation and organizational flexibility. Our efforts to expand into adjacent markets, investments in acquisitions and technology initiatives, and reliance on third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers expose us to supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, pricing volatility and quality control risks that could strain our resilience, while our dependence on key customers and concentrated purchases underscores the need for operational flexibility and strategic adaptation. We describe the importance of inter-organizational collaboration with suppliers, distribution partners and technology vendors to mitigate component shortages, maintain system integrity, and reconfigure resources in response to perturbations. We also discuss our exposure to geopolitical risks, tariffs, export-import regulations, cybersecurity threats, natural disasters and other hazards, each of which requires crisis response, contingency planning and ongoing resilience strategies to preserve organizational performance, maintain system integrity and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

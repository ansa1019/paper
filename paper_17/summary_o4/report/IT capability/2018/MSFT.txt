Our filings recognize that the company must “maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions” by investing heavily in infrastructure, processes, and organizational change to absorb strain and preserve performance despite internal or external disturbances. We acknowledge that “barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services,” and we emphasize that our “ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services.” To mitigate risks ranging from cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities to major earthquakes, weather events, and supply-chain disruptions, we “spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure,” and we continue “devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.” We are “undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation” and continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve software update deployment, and develop mitigation technologies so that we can “defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems.” Providing customers with more cloud services “puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results.” We address component shortages and sole-supplier risks to avoid “reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity,” and we have reorganized our global sales organization, entered into acquisitions and strategic alliances, and use derivative instruments to manage foreign-currency, equity-price, interest-rate, and credit risks as part of our broader strategic response to environmental disruptions. We also model our long-term debt, leases, purchase and construction commitments, and transition tax obligations to ensure liquidity and resource deployment across a range of scenarios, thereby supporting our capacity to absorb strain, adapt to unexpected situations, and sustain the integrity and performance of our operations.

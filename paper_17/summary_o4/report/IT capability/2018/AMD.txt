The company’s disclosures emphasize the interrelationship and compounding effects of multiple risks on its ability to maintain performance under pressure, highlighting reliance on third‐party wafer foundries, assembly‐test‐mark‐and‐pack joint ventures and distributors that allocate manufacturing capacity on a purchase order basis with limited quantity commitments, thereby constraining operational flexibility and exposing the business to supply shortages, manufacturing inefficiencies, power outages or process disruptions that could materially impair continuity. It notes that design failures, process technology failures or yield shortfalls can lead to delivery delays and excess or obsolete inventory, while seasonal, cyclical and volatile demand patterns—such as those driven by cryptocurrency mining—can exacerbate forecasting errors and margin erosion. The company further recognizes that compatibility issues with industry‐standard hardware and software, delays in product introductions, and shifts in customer design windows may weaken competitive positioning and require resource reconfiguration. Its financial resilience is affected by debt covenants, cross‐default provisions and reliance on external financing, which may limit cash flows for R&D and strategic initiatives under challenging economic conditions. In addition, disclosures acknowledge that security vulnerabilities, cyber‐attacks, IT system modifications and data breaches, as well as natural disasters, political instability, tariffs, currency fluctuations and regulatory changes, necessitate ongoing risk mitigation, adaptive strategies and strategic agility to preserve organizational integrity and performance under internal and external disturbances.

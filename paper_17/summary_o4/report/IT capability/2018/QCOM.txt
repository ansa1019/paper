The Company underscores its capacity to adapt and maintain continuity under challenging market, technological, legal and regulatory conditions by noting, for example, that “we have historically been successful during wireless technology transitions” and by affirming that “we believe it is important that we be a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and develop, commercialize and be a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products and services in order to sustain and grow our business long-term.” Among the resilience strategies it describes are its ability to “differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features,” “develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points,” “drive the adoption of our integrated circuit products into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices,” and “identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us, close the transactions and effectively integrate these new businesses and/or technologies.” The Company also highlights its ongoing investments in new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments, including RF front end, automotive, Internet of Things, networking and artificial intelligence, acknowledging that such initiatives “may not succeed due to, among other reasons, improvements in alternate technologies” while noting that these efforts are central to its adaptive strategies for long-term growth. In response to external pressures and internal cost imperatives, the Company has implemented a cost plan designed to reduce annual costs by $1 billion by fiscal 2019 “to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets,” and it has reconfigured its licensing framework to offer cellular standard-essential patent only agreements worldwide while reducing per-unit royalty caps “to enhance stability for the long term,” even though it recognizes that these changes “will negatively impact QTL royalty revenues.” These disclosures together illustrate the organization’s multifaceted approach to resource allocation, risk mitigation, operational flexibility and strategic foresight that underpins its ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and reconfigure trajectories toward a more resilient future.

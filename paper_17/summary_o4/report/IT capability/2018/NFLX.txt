Netflix discloses that interruptions in its computer systems or those of third parties from natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures and cybersecurity risks could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data or theft of intellectual property, and notes that it has implemented systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect its data and systems, although evolving techniques may limit the effectiveness of security measures. The company’s risk disclosures describe the long-term and fixed-cost nature of its multi-year content commitments, including licensed and original programming, which may limit operating flexibility, constrain its ability to adjust expenditures or content offerings in response to changes in member behavior or market dynamics, and require substantially higher upfront cash payments than the related amortization expense. To support continued improvements in its streaming service and international expansion, Netflix highlights its development of proprietary technology and infrastructure—such as its global content delivery network (“Open Connect”)—its utilization of third-party cloud computing services, and its efforts to build expertise across creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other production disciplines. The company further acknowledges its reliance on agreements with distributors, device manufacturers and Amazon Web Services, any disruption or non-renewal of which could adversely impact its ability to retain and attract members, and underscores the ongoing need to refine its systems and operational practices to address varied content offerings, consumer customs, legal and regulatory environments, network operator practices (including restrictions, bandwidth caps or discriminatory management), device interconnectivity and streaming delivery costs. In addition, Netflix identifies potential liabilities arising from negligence or infringement claims in connection with content acquisition, production and distribution, privacy and data protection regulations (including GDPR), payment processing rules, intellectual property claims and evolving government regulations such as net neutrality or consumer protection laws, all of which necessitate continual adjustments in its business processes, risk assessment and mitigation strategies. In its liquidity and capital resources discussion, the company emphasizes that investments in global streaming content—especially original programming—require significant upfront cash outlays relative to amortization patterns, that it expects to continue to increase such investments through multi-year obligations, and that it plans to fund its content pipeline and operations through cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including debt at a lower after-tax cost than equity. Netflix defines free cash flow as an important liquidity metric that measures the cash available after operating and investing activities, excluding non-operational cash flows from short-term investments, and provides detail on its contractual obligations for streaming content, debt, leases and other purchase commitments, thereby illustrating its resource allocation, strategic planning and operational continuity under challenging conditions.

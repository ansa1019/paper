The company recognizes that organizational resilience—the capacity to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances—depends on maintaining business continuity in the face of natural disasters, cyber-attacks, supply interruptions, or other disruptions of expected business conditions and on having disaster-recovery and incident-response plans for its information-technology systems. It also relies on diversified and, where necessary, sole-source supplier arrangements with contingency planning to mitigate capacity constraints, on access to multiple capital markets and backstop credit facilities to preserve liquidity, and on robust compliance, quality, environmental, health and safety programs to adapt to changing regulations and avoid operational shutdown. The company further maintains indemnification and insurance arrangements, establishes reserves to cushion against litigation, regulatory or environmental liabilities, and deploys productivity improvements, internal controls, and dynamic integration processes for acquisitions and divestitures to reconfigure resources, manage emerging risks and sustain performance under competitive, economic and geopolitical pressures. It monitors currency fluctuations, tariff changes, Brexit-related trade and regulatory shifts, and evolving data-privacy regimes to protect its global operations, and allocates financial, human and technical resources to capital expenditures, cybersecurity, pension funding and regulatory compliance, reflecting its strategic foresight, operational flexibility and capacity to reconstitute trajectories toward future objectives despite unexpected events, extreme or nominal, in order to maintain integrity, performance and competitive advantage.

Visaâ€™s disclosure emphasizes that its global payments business is underpinned by a sophisticated information-technology infrastructure that enables transaction authorization, clearing, settlement and network access, necessitating ongoing investment in technology assets, software and data centers, as reflected in rising depreciation and amortization and network-and-processing costs. The company relies on both internally managed and third-party communications networks to transmit data reliably, making service interruptions, technology malfunctions or telecommunications outages a material operational risk that could degrade performance and harm brand perception. Visa also notes the importance of maintaining interoperability between its own systems and those of Visa Europe, underscoring the coordination of assets, processes and interfirm relationships. Outsourcing and specialization of processing functions have expanded the number of external parties handling sensitive cardholder data, heightening exposure to data-breach and fraud risks, which in turn drive expenditures on cybersecurity, fraud management and payment-security services. To mitigate currency-translation and foreign-exchange volatility, the company employs derivative hedges, reflecting an IT-enabled finance and risk-management capability. In its management discussion, Visa identifies continued investment in its digital solutions portfolio, technology infrastructure and processing network as strategic imperatives for supporting growth in ecommerce and mobile payments, for enhancing operational flexibility and for sustaining competitive advantage in a dynamic regulatory and market environment.

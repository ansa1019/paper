Stryker’s 2014 Form 10-K discloses that failure of a key information technology system, process or site could have a material adverse impact on its business, emphasizing that the company relies extensively on IT systems to conduct core operations such as ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, providing data security and other processes necessary to manage the business. The report warns that if these systems are damaged or cease to function properly—due to catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches or other causes—and business continuity plans do not compensate on a timely basis, Stryker may suffer interruptions in operations. It further notes that a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key IT systems, networks, processes, associated sites or third-party service providers, could have a material adverse impact on its business or reputation. The company states that it relies on information technology systems, networks and services—including Internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties—to assist in conducting its business and that numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats, pose potential risks to the security of these systems and to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data and its responsibilities to governments. In response, Stryker reports having made investments to address these threats by monitoring networks and systems, hiring experts, providing employee training and enforcing security policies for employees and third-party providers, while cautioning that costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the Management’s Discussion and Analysis, Stryker also identifies “information technology infrastructure upgrades” as a component of its capital expenditures to support integration of acquisitions, capacity expansion, new product introductions, innovation and cost‐saving initiatives.

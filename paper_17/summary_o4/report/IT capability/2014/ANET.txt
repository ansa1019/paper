As we have grown, we have had to manage an increasingly larger and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business, including our hardware and software development, contract manufacturing and purchasing, logistics and fulfillment and maintenance and support, and to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems. In order to support our strong growth, we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations, and we increasingly depend upon our IT systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations, ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with third-party technology and our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud, and ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to help produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be evaluated frequently. We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the inadequate design and operation of review controls that are intended to ensure the accuracy of the calculations and related disclosures in our consolidated statement of cash flows and, in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements, we are currently evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, identifying and remediating deficiencies and documenting the results of our evaluation, testing and remediation. Our business also increasingly depends on the security of our IT infrastructure, and computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security, or that of our website, and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service; sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects, bugs or other vulnerabilities that could unexpectedly interfere with system operations; our business operations depend in part on the cybersecurity measures of our third-party service providers, distributors, resellers and system integrators; and we rely upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our IT resources in a safe and secure fashion, but if our cybersecurity systems or those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks or mishandling of data, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be severely impaired.

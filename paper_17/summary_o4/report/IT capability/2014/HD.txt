We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, manage and protect transactions and data, and we also depend on the integrity, security and consistent access to this data in managing our business, requiring periodic maintenance and updates by us or our service providers. Customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile devices to shop online, compare prices and products in real time and to provide feedback via social media, and we have implemented and continually review programs like buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS), buy online, ship to store (BOSS) and pilots of buy online, deliver from store (BODFS) to anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process and provide a multichannel shopping environment. Through our information technology developments and enhanced online and mobile experience, including website navigation and search improvements, expanded chat functionality, multiple online communities and knowledge centers, and a second-generation First Phone mobile service tool for store associates offering an intuitive smartphone interface, internet access to convert online sales in the aisle, integrated mobile checkout and improved processing speed, we drive both in-store and online sales and support an interconnected retail strategy. These systems and third-party networks are subject to damage, interruption or compromise from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches and other events, and we have implemented processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access or use of secured data and to prevent data loss, including enhanced encryption of payment card data at the point of sale and deployment of EMV chip-and-PIN technology. We rely on various third parties to establish standards, develop and test required software, define applicable certification standards and certify compliance for new payment methods, such as EMV transactions, and to provide payment processing services, and failure by those parties or by us to timely implement needed elements or comply with evolving rules, regulations and data security standards could expose us to liability, fines, higher transaction fees or disruptions to our ability to facilitate payments. We have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain and technology initiatives—including highly automated direct fulfillment centers and new web-based tools and services—designed to streamline operations, simplify customer interaction and balance cost efficiency and speed, although the cost and complexity of these implementations and our reliance on third-party service providers could disrupt or reduce operational efficiency, delay or prevent realization of anticipated benefits and adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.

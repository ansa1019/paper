The company acknowledges that it may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions caused by natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism, computer viruses, break-ins or other events, and that system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and its disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities; such failures or disruptions could prevent access to its online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders, and could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transaction processing and financial reporting.  The company’s business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information (“PII”), including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information, which increases its risk of being targeted; accordingly, the company requires user names and passwords to access its information technology systems and uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent unauthorized access to company data or accounts.  To help protect customers and the company, it monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, and it devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures, although these measures cannot provide absolute security.  In support of its ongoing operations and strategic expansion, the company anticipates approximately $12.4 billion of its planned 2015 capital expenditures will be directed to data centers and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements.

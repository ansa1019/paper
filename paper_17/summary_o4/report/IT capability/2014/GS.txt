Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions—many of which are highly complex and occur at very high volumes and frequencies—across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies; these transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines and legal and regulatory standards.  As our client base and geographical reach expand, and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of electronic transactions (and the requirements to report them on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and exchanges) increases, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging, and the risk of systems or human error in processing such transactions also increases, as do the potential consequences of such errors given the speed and volume of activity and the difficulty in detecting and remediating errors quickly enough to limit adverse impact.  Our financial, accounting, data processing and other operational systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled—due to spikes in transaction volumes or other events beyond our control—which could impair our ability to process transactions or provide services, and we must continuously update these systems to support growth, respond to regulatory and market changes, and invest heavily in controls and training to ensure compliance with applicable rules and to avoid market disruptions.  Systems enhancements and updates, as well as the requisite training, entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, and our interconnectivity with third-party vendors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and clients exposes us to the risk of operational failures both within those parties’ systems and in our own.  Moreover, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and proprietary information in our computer systems and networks and, despite protective measures and continuous monitoring, we face ongoing threats from cyber attacks—including denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code—which could jeopardize our or our clients’ information, interrupt critical operations, expose us to litigation or regulatory action and cause reputational damage, especially as the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies heightens these and other operational risks.

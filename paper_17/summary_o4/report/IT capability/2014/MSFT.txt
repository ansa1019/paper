The report highlights Microsoft’s evolving IT capabilities as reflected in its strategic investments in secure and scalable infrastructure, cloud computing, and platform ecosystems. The company devotes significant resources to develop and deploy its cloud operating system and to build and maintain datacenters, enabling integrated private and public cloud environments with common security, management, and administration. It embraces early adoption of new devices and consumer-oriented technologies to enhance internal data sharing and communications, while acknowledging that business policies and internal security controls must keep pace with rapidly evolving cyber threats. Security of Microsoft’s information technology environment is critical to support customer reliance on cloud-based services and to ensure the reliability, confidentiality, and integrity of customer data; accordingly, Microsoft continuously engineers more secure products and services, enhances security and reliability features, improves deployment of software updates, develops mitigation technologies for unpatched systems, maintains digital security infrastructure, and provides customers with firewalls and anti-virus software. Emphasis on platform-based ecosystems and network effects among users, developers, and partners underscores the importance of combining IT resources, management skills, and business process understanding to achieve competitive advantage and respond to changing market dynamics. To support these objectives, the company increased R&D and capital investments in devices engineering, sessions on cloud strategies, and infrastructure upgrades, incurred higher datacenter expenses to scale its commercial cloud offerings (whose revenue doubled year-over-year), and integrated acquired technology and personnel to enhance operational flexibility and IT governance, all while managing risks related to cyber-attacks, regulatory compliance, and interfirm transactions.

The company’s 2014 management discussion observes that it faces “rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization)” in its served markets and is “making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources … in order to be responsive to the company’s customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company’s operations.”  In its risk factors the company further warns that “a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business,” noting that it “relies on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.”  The company cautions that “security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers,” which may expose it to “legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation,” any of which “could adversely affect our business and financial statements.”

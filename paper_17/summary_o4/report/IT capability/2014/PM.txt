We use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others; some of these systems are managed by third-party service providers, and we maintain backup systems and business continuity plans and take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. Nevertheless, failure of our information systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could result in loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us.

Our annual report emphasizes that information technology forms a critical underpinning of our enterprise, encompassing computing hardware, imaging electronics, software applications and network systems that coordinate our assets, internal processes and inter-organizational transactions.  We expressly recognize the necessity of allocating and managing resources to build and sustain a robust technology infrastructure to “operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements,” and warn that failure to do so could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, business disruptions, loss of customers or compromise of intellectual property through security breaches.  We rely on our data management systems “to effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business,” and acknowledge that equipment malfunctions, software deficiencies or human error may impair our ability to plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations.  To protect customer, employee and partner personally identifiable information, we employ user authentication, passwords, encryption and other security measures, but concede that third-party security breaches, employee error, malicious software, worms, viruses or other vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access, service interruptions, reputational damage, litigation and liability, any of which “could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.”

Abbott relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and acknowledges that the size and complexity of these systems makes them vulnerable to cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption; to reduce these risks, Abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats, while recognizing that these measures may not prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. In connection with corporate separations and dispositions, Abbott and its affiliates have entered into transitional services agreements under which Abbott provides certain information technology and back-office support services on an interim basis, with billings recorded as a reduction of the costs to provide those services in the applicable expense category. Capital expenditures have included material investments in information technology to upgrade and expand manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment, as well as laboratory instruments placed with customers, reflecting the importance of IT resources in supporting operational efficiency, data management, regulatory compliance and the coordination of internal processes and inter-company relationships.

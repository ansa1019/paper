We require user names and passwords to access our information technology systems and employ encryption and authentication technologies to secure data transmission and storage, using both internally developed and third-party systems for transaction processing, order management and financial operations. While we maintain redundant hosting services and global data centers, these systems remain vulnerable to human error, natural disasters, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage and cyber-attacks such as phishing, SQL injection and denial-of-service incidents, which could compromise consumer and transaction data, impair service availability, slow response times and damage our brands. We expend significant resources to protect against security breaches and to expand and upgrade our technology infrastructure to cope with rapid growth in consumer traffic, mobile commerce and geographic breadth, yet our disaster recovery plans are not fully formalized in every region and we rely on third-party computer systems, global distribution systems and external payment processors that may be terminated on short notice, creating risks of interruptions in reservations and cash flow. We depend on online advertising channels and search engine placements, including pay-per-click agreements with Google and affiliates, and face challenges from evolving internet search algorithms, “cookie” regulations, mobile platform constraints and competitive dynamics, which may affect our ability to efficiently generate website and app traffic. Our processing and storage of large volumes of personally identifiable data are increasingly subject to global data protection laws, and security breaches at our affiliates or providers could expose us to regulatory sanctions, liability, reputational damage and loss of consumer confidence, all of which underscore the critical importance of our information management, system resilience and technology deployment in supporting our business strategy and operations.

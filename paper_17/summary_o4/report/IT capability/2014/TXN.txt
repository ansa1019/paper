Operating internationally exposes us to political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate, any of which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results. We have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as health epidemics, severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations. Breaches of our information technology systems or those of our customers or suppliers could be caused by computer viruses, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism and could compromise our information technology networks or those of our customers or suppliers, resulting in unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information, a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations, the release of employee personal data, or increased information technology protection costs, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. Our global sales force is larger than those of our competitors, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts tens of millions of visits to our website each year where customers often begin their initial product searches and design-in journey.

We rely on networks and information systems and other technology (“information systems”) to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, as well as to process financial information for internal and regulatory reporting, manage digital marketing activities and enable electronic communications among our global locations, personnel, bottlers, customers, suppliers and consumers. Because information systems are critical to many of our operating activities, our operations may be disrupted by system shutdowns, service interruptions or security breaches caused by routine failures (such as system upgrades or user errors), network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, computer hackers, rogue employees or contractors, cyber-attacks, geopolitical events, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, any of which could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information, violation of data privacy laws, damage to reputation, legal or regulatory actions, and financial losses from our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice or collect payments for concentrate or finished products. In order to address these risks, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies, cyber-insurance and training of company personnel and maintain an information risk management program supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee, under which reports analyzing emerging risks and the company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management. As part of our global productivity and reinvestment program, one of four primary areas of focus is “data and information technology systems standardization,” together with global supply chain optimization, global marketing and innovation effectiveness, and operating expense leverage and operational excellence, designed to generate significant annualized productivity that can be reinvested in brand-building and media initiatives.

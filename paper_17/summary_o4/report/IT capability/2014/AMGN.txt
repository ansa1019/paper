We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, recognizing that our computer environment is inherently vulnerable to service interruptions or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack, and that data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may expose sensitive data—including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to the company, its patients, customers or other business partners—to unauthorized persons or the public. Cyber-attacks, which are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, could deploy harmful malware, denial-of-service or social-engineering means to threaten service reliability and data confidentiality, integrity and availability, and any security breach affecting us or our key business partners could materially impair our security posture. Although past intrusions have not had a material adverse effect on our operations, we cannot assure that our substantial investments in data and information technology protection will prevent future service interruptions or undetected breaches that could result in the loss of critical or sensitive information or otherwise cause financial, legal, business or reputational harm. In addition, we note that our price reporting data processes are complex and require quarterly reviews and restatements where necessary; these data calculations affect provider payment rates, rebates and mandated discounts under government healthcare programs, and if our submissions were incorrect we could face substantial fines, enforcement actions or additional payment obligations.

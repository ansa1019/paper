The annual report discloses that the Company expects to continue to invest significant management attention and resources in its information technology infrastructure and in its privacy and security capabilities, reflecting a strategic focus on solving problems faster and more efficiently and supporting its transition to more connected services.  The risk factors emphasize the Company’s increasing dependence on the ongoing operation and availability of its information technology and communication systems and those of external service providers, including cloud computing, and note that the Company does not currently have full redundancy for all systems, maintains many critical applications in a single data center without real-time data backup, and may not account for all disaster-recovery scenarios, any of which could lead to data loss, processing interruptions, customer loss and reputational damage.  The report further describes in-flight initiatives to update customer-facing applications and migrate legacy applications and infrastructure to new data centers and third-party hosted environments, warning that ineffective execution may cause unplanned service disruptions or cost overruns.  It also highlights reliance on both internal and external systems to take and fulfill customer orders, handle service requests and host online activities, with any interruption or failure potentially harming revenue and compromising customer data.  In addition, the Company is undertaking continuing, complex and costly efforts to upgrade and expand its network security, high-availability capabilities and information systems, acknowledging that design or implementation failures could disrupt operations, delay new offerings and damage its competitive position.  As the Company collects and retains increasing volumes of sensitive and personal customer and employee data, it employs commercially available security technologies and business controls to protect confidentiality, accuracy and access, but recognizes that major security breaches, vulnerability exploitation or delays in remediation could materially harm business performance, brand reputation, invite regulatory scrutiny and impair its ability to provide financial transaction services.  Finally, the management’s discussion and analysis highlights ongoing investments to update and improve internal information technology systems and software platforms to meet growing and evolving business and customer requirements and cautions that prolonged delays, integration challenges or unsuccessful implementations could lead to outages, lost revenue and reputational risk.

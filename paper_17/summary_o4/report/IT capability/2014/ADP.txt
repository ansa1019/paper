Our disclosures underscore the evolving role of technology in our operations and strategic initiatives. We rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems, and we warn that, if any of these systems fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation. To maintain operational flexibility and resilience, we have implemented disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against events such as natural disasters, power or communication failures, or similar disruptions. We acknowledge that our operating environment is designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information but note that we cannot monitor similar safeguards implemented by our clients or vendors, and that third parties may circumvent even robust protections, requiring us as threats continue to evolve to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. In order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands in industries subject to rapid technological advances and changing needs and preferences, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our existing solutions and services, investing to grow and scale our human capital management business process outsourcing solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes and by investing in systems development and programming to develop, support, and maintain our products. Our strategic pillars reflect our focus on embracing new technology and innovation to deliver market-leading cloud-based HCM, benefits, and payroll solutions, to leverage our global presence in serving clients where they do business, and to build and retain talent. We have committed capital expenditures to data center and facility improvements to support our operations, and we maintain operating lease and software license obligations as well as purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets in line with our emphasis on technology infrastructure and capability.

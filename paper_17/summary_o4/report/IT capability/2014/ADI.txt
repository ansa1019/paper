A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation, since we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and e-mail. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and we may be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties. Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches, and third-party partners may also be subject to breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of confidential information, which could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Any prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, or any security breach of our systems or those of our partners, could result in the loss of sales and customers, significant incremental costs and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.

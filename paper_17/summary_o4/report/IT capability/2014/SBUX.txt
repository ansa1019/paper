Starbucks discloses that it relies heavily on information technology systems across its operations—including point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms (such as online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs), administrative functions, supply chain management, Starbucks Cards and loyalty functionality—and also on the information technology systems of its third-party business partners and service providers, and warns that any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate its business and adversely affect its financial results. The company acknowledges that the unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of proprietary or confidential information stored in its IT systems could materially damage its reputation and brand, expose it to potential liability, disrupt its plans and require significant capital investments and other expenditures—such as additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services—to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in its systems or those of third-party partners can also adversely impact brand and business. To mitigate these risks, Starbucks continues to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate cyber-attacks, prevent breaches and data loss, and support the reliability, integrity and capacity of its digital infrastructure, and maintains disaster recovery and business continuity plans to limit material negative impacts on product availability, operational efficiency, sales and overall financial performance. In its capital plan for fiscal 2015, the company expects to include systems and technology investments in stores and support infrastructure among its primary uses of cash.

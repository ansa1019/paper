Amazon’s annual report discloses that its rapid expansion of global operations and broadening of product, service, and digital content offerings have placed significant strain on its systems, technical performance, and internal processes and reporting functions, necessitating ongoing investments in technology infrastructure—including software and hardware upgrades, data center and network capacity expansion through AWS and fulfillment networks—to support business strategies and work processes, enhance customer experience, and improve operational efficiencies. The company identifies its technology and content costs as principally payroll and related expenses for research and development activities, application, platform, and website development, category expansion, editorial content, merchandising selection, and AWS infrastructure, with significant amounts capitalized as internal-use software. Amazon warns that failure to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade its systems and network infrastructure, or implement sufficient redundancy and disaster recovery plans could cause system interruptions, delays, and data loss—exacerbated by reliance on third-party technology for encryption, authentication, content delivery, and back-office support and by threats such as viruses, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, computer intrusions, and data theft. It further notes that its expansion into new technologies and geographies may entail novel technology challenges and that intensified competition will require continued devotion of resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing, underscoring the critical role of mobilizing and deploying IT resources in concert with other organizational capabilities to maintain competitive advantage, operational flexibility, and market responsiveness.

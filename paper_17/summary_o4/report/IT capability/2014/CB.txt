Our risk factors acknowledge that “man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attack” pose a material threat and that “a failure in our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties, including due to security breaches or cyber-attacks, could disrupt business, damage our reputation, and cause losses.” We disclose that our “operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information and assets, including in our computer systems and networks,” and that our “business depends on effective information security and systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data our information systems use to run our business.” We further note that our “ability to adequately price products and services, to establish reserves, to provide effective, efficient and secure service to our customers, to value our investments and to timely and accurately report our financial results also depends significantly on the integrity and availability of the data we maintain, including that within our information systems, as well as data in and assets held through third-party service providers and systems.” Accordingly, “in an effort to ensure the integrity of such data, we implement new security measures and systems and improve or upgrade our existing security measures and systems on a continuing basis,” although we qualify that “such measures may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access, computer viruses, malware or other malicious code or cyber-attack” and caution that “as the breadth and complexity of our security infrastructure continues to grow, the potential risk of a security event increases.” We warn that “if additional security events occur, these events may jeopardize ACE’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored within ACE, and transmitted through its computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions, delays, or malfunctions in operations, or result in data loss or loss of assets which could result in significant losses, reputational damage or a material adverse effect on our operations and critical business functions.” We similarly acknowledge that “the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding” and that breaches of our “established controls with respect to our client data” could expose us to “significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution.” In our critical accounting estimates, we describe how “we use various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) and data analytics to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities,” and how we “use the modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making (e.g., underwriting, pricing, claims, reserving, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk) and to maintain competitive advantage,” while acknowledging that these outputs “are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis” and that “actual results may differ materially from our modeled results,” potentially affecting our underwriting profitability and business growth. Finally, in our discussion of fair value measurements, we explain that we “categorize financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy at the balance sheet date based upon the lowest level of inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement” and that we maintain “controls to review significant price changes and stale pricing, and to ensure that prices received from pricing services have been accurately reflected in the consolidated financial statements.”

The Company discloses that competing successfully depends heavily on its ability to rapidly deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace and provide products and services that make search results and ads relevant and useful for its users.  It states that, as technology continues to develop, it must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance its search technology and its existing products and services, and introduce new offerings that users can easily and effectively use.  The Company expects to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices and notes that more people are using devices other than desktop computers to access the Internet and to make search queries.  It acknowledges that the availability of its products and services depends on the continuing operation of its information technology and communications systems, including data centers, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption, and that its highly technical and complex products may contain errors or vulnerabilities that could result in service interruptions or failures.  The Company recognizes that cyber-attack techniques change frequently and it experiences attacks on a regular basis, that its security measures may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or otherwise, and that such breaches could result in the release of users’ data and exposure to significant legal and financial liability.  It observes that regulatory authorities are considering measures affecting its encryption of users’ data and that the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are often uncertain, potentially requiring changes to its data practices at substantial cost.  In connection with acquisitions, the Company identifies risks in integrating acquired companies’ accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems and in implementing or remediating controls, procedures, and policies at acquired entities.  It also notes that Internet access providers may restrict, block, degrade or charge for access to its services, and that it continuously combats web spam through indexing technology and algorithmic changes to improve search quality.  Finally, the Company reports that it expects to continue investing heavily in its systems, data centers, real estate and facilities, and information technology infrastructure, and that failure to keep its websites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions could materially impair its business and operating results.

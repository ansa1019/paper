Our disclosures emphasize that our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of our business strategies and work processes is fundamental to sustaining competitive advantage, as we must continually develop, market and enhance high-technology products and services by anticipating customers’ changing needs, emerging technological trends and shifts to new platforms and standards, while adapting our core technologies into new applications and software delivery methods such as our subscription- and cloud-based models. We highlight that our cloud strategy demands substantial ongoing investment in product development, data center and network infrastructure, scalable transaction processing systems and data management capabilities to ensure information accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access—increasing our operational flexibility and resource deployment—but that any delays, cost overruns or gaps in building the necessary infrastructure, business models, IT architecture or incident-response processes can impair service availability, frustrate customer adoption, and erode our results. Our reliance on third-party hosting and content-delivery providers, the need to continuously engineer and harden products against cyber-attacks, defects, worms and malicious software, and the imperative to protect confidential source code, intellectual property and large volumes of customer data illustrate the pervasive security, privacy and governance dimensions of our IT capability. We also underscore the challenges of integrating acquired technologies, coordinating interfirm relationships with strategic partners, managing compliance with evolving privacy and data-protection regulations, enforcing our IP rights and ensuring that our multiple technology platforms remain modern and interoperable, all of which are critical to transforming our firm’s assets and internal processes into sustainable performance gains and long-term organizational resilience.

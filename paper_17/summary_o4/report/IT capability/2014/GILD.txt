The report describes the company’s reliance on complex inventory management agreements and forecasting processes to coordinate product distribution and end‐user demand, noting that wholesalers estimate demand under those agreements while retail and non‐wholesale channels operate without the company’s direct control, which can lead to mismatches between prescription demand and revenues. It further discloses a heavy dependence on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, warning that the multitude and complexity of its computer systems expose the firm to service interruptions, destruction, malicious intrusion and random attacks, and that data privacy or security breaches—potentially of intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information—along with increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks threaten service reliability as well as data confidentiality, integrity and availability. The company acknowledges ongoing investments in protecting its data and IT infrastructure but cautions that such measures may not fully prevent interruptions or breaches that could inflict financial, legal, operational or reputational harm, thereby implicitly underscoring the importance of mobilizing, deploying and securing IT resources to support business strategies, internal processes and interfirm transactions.

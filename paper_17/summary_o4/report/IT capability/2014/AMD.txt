We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our ability to coordinate assets, manage inventory and fulfill customer demand on a timely basis.  These information systems must be sufficiently scalable to support business growth and frequently require modifications or upgrades—efforts that can be costly, disruptive of operations and demanding of management time, internal control redesign and employee training.  To improve agility and reduce complexity, we continuously consolidate and standardize our information systems while also embracing mobility and cloud-based communication to enhance business efficiency, but these practices can result in a more distributed IT environment in which maintaining visibility, administrative control and compliance requirements over both internal and external users becomes increasingly difficult.  We also rely on third-party IT service providers—including help desk support, desktop-application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data-center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access—and cannot guarantee that they will fulfill contractual responsibilities or that the transition of these services in-house or to alternate providers will not disrupt operations or our supply-chain logistics.  In addition, our IT and those of our partners are vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic events, power anomalies, viruses, malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and network failures, any of which could expose sensitive intellectual property and confidential business information to unauthorized access, impose significant remediation costs, divert management attention, harm our reputation and materially disrupt business processes.

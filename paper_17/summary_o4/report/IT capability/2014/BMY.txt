We are increasingly dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face significant cybersecurity and data‐leakage risks; a breakdown, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical IT systems or infrastructure—whether through internal error, authorized access, malware, industrial espionage or other cyberattacks—could negatively impact our operations. The ever‐evolving use of digital technologies, including cloud‐based computing and non-encrypted portable media, creates opportunities for unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our systems or those of our third-party providers. Although such events have not yet materially affected our business, we have been targeted by cyber incidents and expect the threats to persist. To mitigate these risks, we have invested in industry-appropriate protections, monitoring practices and ongoing system surveillance, but there can be no assurance that efforts will preclude future breakdowns or breaches. We also rely on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners and alliance partners—including those providing information‐technology, business‐unit, finance and other functional services—whose failure to meet contractual, regulatory or business-continuity obligations, or to safeguard privacy and data security, could materially harm our operations and reputation. In addition, the expanding use of social media platforms poses risks of brand damage, information leakage, legal implications and unauthorized collection or dissemination of personally identifiable or non-public company-sensitive information, while the identification of new points of entry as social media proliferates presents ongoing challenges for securing and protecting information.

Across our cable communications and NBCUniversal segments, we underscore the strategic importance of aligning and mobilizing IT-based resources to support business strategies and work processes. We emphasize our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing digital technologies—such as our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology, wireless gateways and outdoor, business and in-home Wi-Fi hotspots—to enhance connectivity, operational flexibility and customer access through portals and mobile apps that deliver live programming, on-demand content, email, contacts and calendars. Our business services leverage cloud network servers, interactive online document tools and hosted voice services to coordinate customer relationships, while our home security and automation offerings illustrate actionable IT investments that integrate network infrastructure, software and hardware. As network and information systems are critical to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery, we continuously invest in systems for process optimization, information management and security—implementing monitoring systems, defensive measures against cyber attacks, and vendor-provided hardware, software and operational support—to ensure the timeliness, reliability, confidentiality and security of customer, personnel and vendor data. Failure to execute technology initiatives or to effectively integrate and govern these IT capabilities could diminish competitive advantages, erode performance gains and impair our ability to adapt to evolving market dynamics.

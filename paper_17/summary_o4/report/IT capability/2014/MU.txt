The 10-K discloses significant strategic resource allocation and coordination of internal processes and assets through substantial capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities and R&D—estimated at $3.6 to $4.0 billion for 2015—to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality; it details continuous implementation of advanced process technology at multiple global sites (U.S., Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and China), partnerships such as the IMFT NAND Flash joint development program with Intel and the DRAM R&D collaboration with Nanya, and transitions of production capacity (including the shift of a Singapore fab from DRAM to NAND Flash) to align manufacturing output with market demand. It further describes the integration of acquired entities (Micron Memory Japan and Inotera) to expand wafer capacity and the supply agreement with Inotera for dramatic increases in DRAM output, as well as organizational restructuring and workforce optimization initiatives to optimize operations, improve efficiency and focus on core memory operations. Inventory management practices—including lower‐of‐cost‐or‐market adjustments based on forecasted selling prices, volumes and completion costs—reflect efforts to tailor information and performance metrics in response to changing business needs. The report also highlights governance and oversight constraints imposed by Japan court reorganization proceedings on MMJ’s ability to pay dividends or make loans, the limited control over joint ventures, and the use of balance sheet hedges and derivative instruments to manage currency, debt and other financial risks, all of which underscore the firm’s ongoing efforts to mobilize, deploy and reconfigure technological, financial and human resources in support of competitive advantage, process optimization and enhanced firm performance.

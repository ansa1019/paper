PepsiCo’s disclosures recognize information technology as a strategic resource integral to coordinating assets, processes and interfirm relationships and driving competitive advantage through enhanced business strategies and work‐process support. The company states that it “depends on information technology, including public websites and cloud‐based services, for many activities important to our business, including to interface with our customers and consumers, to engage in digital marketing activities, to enable and improve the effectiveness of our operations, to order and manage materials from suppliers, to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements, to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information, and to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our independent bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint ventures, suppliers and other third parties.” It has entered into agreements with third‐party service providers to share “information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions,” and “may enter into agreements to share services for other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies.” It has also undertaken a “multi‐year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise‐wide systems solutions,” and notes that failure “to allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of the trade.” The risks of inadequate IT capability are emphasized by disclosures that “cyberattacks” are “occurring more frequently” and “becoming more sophisticated,” and that failure “to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to, cybersecurity incidents or if our information systems are otherwise disrupted” could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, unauthorized access to confidential information, damage to reputation, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation and remediation costs. Conversely, the company’s productivity and cost‐reduction programs, which include expanding automation, optimizing global manufacturing footprints and re‐engineering go‐to‐market systems, depend on “mobilizing and deploying IT‐based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities” to deliver performance gains, support innovation and position the firm as an adaptive, digitally enabled competitor in dynamic market environments.

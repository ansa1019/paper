The Company’s operations are highly dependent on its information technology infrastructure, as evidenced by the statement that “we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business” and that “failure to adequately update our systems and disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations.” Recognizing the importance of mobilizing IT–based resources, the Company discloses that “we are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business,” while cautioning that “the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process can mitigate this risk.” The criticality of information management capability is underscored by the observation that if the Company “do[es] not maintain the privacy and security of member-related and other business information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation,” and that its “online business…depends upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks.” In support of its evolving multichannel strategy, the Company notes that “our members are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to shop online. As part of our multichannel strategy, we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.” Furthermore, management acknowledges that “central operating costs” have increased “primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems,” demonstrating an ongoing commitment to enhancing IT capability to coordinate internal processes, support business needs, and maintain competitive advantage.

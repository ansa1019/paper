In discussing the risks associated with scaling production, Tesla notes that “the information technology systems that we are currently expanding and improving upon” must be effective to manage higher‐volume production, with particular need for robust product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management and financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems. The filing also warns of inherent risks in “developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as implementing new systems,” which could disrupt data management, procurement, manufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes, impair timely reporting and internal controls, and require significant resources to fix if “these systems or their functionality do not operate as we expect them to.” Tesla further acknowledges that its vehicles “are highly dependent on software to operate,” noting complexity of software for components such as the 17-inch display screen, panoramic roof and 12-volt battery, and that customers must rely on “built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates” to improve functionality. Moreover, Tesla recognizes that its information technology networks and communications may be “vulnerable to interception, manipulation, damage, disruptions or shutdowns” by hackers or operational errors, potentially resulting in unauthorized control of vehicle systems, access to location and user data, legal claims, negative publicity and harm to its brand, business and financial results.

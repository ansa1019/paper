Applied’s risk disclosures identify information technology or infrastructure failures as a source of manufacturing interruptions or delays that could impair its ability to meet customer demand and increase costs, noting that “information technology or infrastructure failures” may disrupt its supply chain and order fulfillment.  The company further discloses that it “outsources certain functions to third parties, including … software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities,” and is undertaking “a multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes, including enhancements or replacements to certain enterprise resource planning (ERP) software systems.”  Applied cautions that “the implementation of additional functionality to the ERP system entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data,” and that during transitions it “must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient.”  In describing its cybersecurity posture, Applied states that it “collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems,” has “experienced … cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to … advanced persistent threats,” devotes significant resources to “network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse,” and acknowledges that cybersecurity incidents “could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.”

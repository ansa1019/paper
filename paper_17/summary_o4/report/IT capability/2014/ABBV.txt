In connection with its separation from Abbott, AbbVie has assumed responsibility for and incurred incremental costs to establish stand-alone information technology infrastructure and transaction processing services—functions that were previously provided by Abbott under transition services agreements.  Such agreements have covered the mobilization and deployment of IT resources alongside accounts payable, payroll, receivables collection, treasury, order entry, warehousing, quality assurance and other administrative services both in the United States and in international markets until AbbVie’s own back-office systems were fully implemented.  As part of this transition, AbbVie is conducting a phased global implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and related technology infrastructure to replace the legacy IT environment inherited at separation.  These initiatives include modifications to the design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting, which AbbVie reviews for design effectiveness prior to each implementation phase.  Prior to and following separation, allocations for corporate support services—such as telecommunications, corporate income tax, internal audit and information technology—were recorded in AbbVie’s combined financial statements.  Together, these actions reflect AbbVie’s capability to acquire, deploy and integrate IT-based resources in support of its independent business operations and strategic objectives.

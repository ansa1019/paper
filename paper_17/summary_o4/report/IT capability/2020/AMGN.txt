The report emphasizes that our operations depend critically on “sophisticated information technology systems, including software, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems,” and warns that “a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation.” It further explains that the shift of the majority of employees to a remote work environment “has increased substantially our reliance on our and third-party information technology systems” and “risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of cybersecurity attacks (including social engineering attacks), and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or our proprietary or confidential information.” The report details that “internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or adversely affect our reputation,” and that “attacks such as those experienced by governmental entities and other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access or protect important data.” Examples cited include ransomware and supply-chain attacks—specifically the SolarWinds incident in which malicious code was inserted into legitimate software updates, enabling attackers to access third-party documents. To address these vulnerabilities, we “continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems,” while acknowledging that our cyber-liability insurance “is not sufficient to cover us against all losses” from service interruptions, breaches or data loss. Finally, the report notes that we are “subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection,” including the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA, and that “failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”

Our filings emphasize that our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies and to continuously mobilize and reconfigure IT resources in support of our business strategies and work processes, and that failure to choose or deploy technology or equipment as effectively or as early as our competitors or to execute our technology initiatives—such as the deployment of the X1 and Sky Q platforms, xFi-enabled wireless gateways, wireless gateways and the Peacock streaming service—could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We recognize that new technologies can materially impact our businesses by affecting demand, distribution methods, customer purchase and viewing behaviors and the growth of digital and streaming distribution platforms available to advertisers, and that competition from next-generation broadband technologies, digital video distribution and streaming services intensifies the need for ongoing investment in and reconfiguration of our IT architecture and digital infrastructure to maintain operational flexibility and a competitive edge. We rely on network and information systems, including those embedded in our products and services and those supporting network management, customer service operations and programming delivery, as well as on third-party vendors to supply hardware, software and operational support essential to providing our offerings, and we acknowledge that if these vendors fail to meet our specifications or suffer operating or financial difficulties, our ability to serve customers could be compromised. We further acknowledge that cyber threats and attacks against both known and newly discovered software and hardware vulnerabilities are constantly evolving and could, through process breakdowns, security design vulnerabilities, malicious software, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, power outages or natural disasters, degrade or disrupt our products and services, compromise confidential or technical business information, damage our equipment or reputation and expose us to litigation or regulatory fines, and that maintaining and securing these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change. Our experience during the COVID-19 pandemic—when our distribution network successfully accommodated increased traffic from video streaming, gaming and videoconferencing as customers worked and learned remotely—underscores the strategic importance of robust IT capability and resilient digital infrastructure.

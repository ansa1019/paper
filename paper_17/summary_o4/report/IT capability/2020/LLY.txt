The annual report underscores the company’s extensive reliance on complex information technology systems, infrastructure, and networks to accumulate, process, store, and transmit large volumes of confidential information and other data, while identifying significant vulnerabilities in system adequacy, controls, service continuity, and security that could disrupt business processes, intellectual property protection, manufacturing operations, supply‐chain distribution, clinical trial management, and third‐party collaborations. It warns that failures, breaches, or malicious intrusions—such as cyber-attacks, operating failures, service interruptions, unauthorized access, or data manipulation—could materially harm operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, reputation, and customer relationships, and notes a program of cyber liability insurance alongside ongoing investments in protective, detection, response, and resiliency measures to safeguard IT assets. The company also recognizes dependencies on third-party providers for data hosting, cloud services, and IT support, acknowledging that vulnerabilities or contractual nonperformance in these outsourced functions could compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it shifted in-person interactions to virtual engagements enabled by digital technologies, reflecting the role of IT capability in maintaining continuity of clinical trials, manufacturing and distribution processes, and employee operations under evolving public health guidance.

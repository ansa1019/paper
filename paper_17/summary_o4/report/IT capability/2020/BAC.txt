The discussion emphasizes that a failure of our information technology infrastructure or operational and security systems, whether internal or at third parties or within the financial services industry, could disrupt critical business operations, customer services, liquidity and compliance, underscoring the integral role of our IT systems in business continuity and enterprise resilience.  We note that we are “increasingly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to operate our businesses remotely,” reflecting the work-from-home posture and evolving customer preferences for “digital banking and other digital services,” and that effective management of remote operations depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of digital platforms.  Our business relies on the secure collection, processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential and proprietary information in our computer and data management systems and networks, including access management controls, and we regularly update these systems to support operations, growth and compliance, which entails significant costs and risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing infrastructure.  The corporation identifies cyber attacks and security breaches—ranging from malware and ransomware to state-sponsored events and social engineering—as pervasive, sophisticated and evolving threats that are magnified by increased remote access, and acknowledges that systemic cyber events could cause outages across financial services infrastructure and third-party providers.  We have invoked a centralized enterprise response framework to manage IT-related disruptions, including maintaining backup systems, training, business continuity plans and safeguards, while our board and management committees oversee IT-related operational, compliance and reputational risks.  Within consumer banking, we highlight “leading digital banking platforms” with over 39 million active users, including approximately 31 million mobile users, and recognize ongoing pressure to adapt products and services through technology investments—such as online and mobile channels, automation and cloud-based solutions—to meet changing customer needs and support business transformation.  These disclosures collectively reflect our view that mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other corporate capabilities is essential to maintaining operational flexibility, managing risk and enabling the organization’s digital transformation and competitive agility.

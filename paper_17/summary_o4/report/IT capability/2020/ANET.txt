Our risk disclosures highlight that our business depends on the overall demand for information technology, network connectivity and access to data and applications, and that the networking market is rapidly evolving as end customers deploy larger, more sophisticated networks and increase the use of virtualization and cloud computing. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing platforms, which incorporate our EOS software and related network applications, and our cloud-networking platforms are highly scalable and programmable, purpose-built to address workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, delivering constant connectivity and access to data and applications. We sell products and post-contract support through direct and channel partners, and continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts reflects our installed base expansion and information management capability. We continue to invest heavily in software development to expand our cloud-networking platform’s functionality, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. Risk factors include failure to anticipate technological shifts, such as adoption of disaggregated “white box” solutions or open-source network operating systems, which could render our offerings obsolete or less attractive; challenges ensuring our products interoperate with operating systems, software applications and hardware developed by others; and the need to mobilize IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to maintain competitive advantage. Adverse economic conditions or reduced IT and network infrastructure spending could lengthen sales cycles and defer purchases, while supply-chain disruptions have extended lead times and increased costs, potentially impairing operational flexibility and gross margins. Finally, cybersecurity and data-privacy risks—such as defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our security products or internal networks—pose threats to information reliability, security, confidentiality and overall system capability, and rapid changes in regulatory contexts, market dynamics and external influences may further challenge our resource allocation, strategic alignment and ability to support evolving business needs.

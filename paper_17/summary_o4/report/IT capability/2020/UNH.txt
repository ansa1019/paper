The company’s operations are highly dependent on its information systems and data integrity, and it recognizes that a failure properly to maintain, protect, consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand existing systems or to ensure its technology products operate as intended could materially and adversely affect its results of operations, financial position and cash flows; it therefore commits significant resources to enhancing and developing systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving regulatory standards and customer preferences.  The rapidly expanding volume of health care data, including electronic health records, and the growing importance of connectivity among devices—such as sophisticated mobile applications—underscore the need to mobilize, deploy and leverage information‐management capabilities to support innovation in service delivery, pricing accuracy, reporting and uninterrupted customer service.  The company periodically consolidates and integrates platforms following technology initiatives, regulatory requirements and business acquisitions, but an unsuccessful integration or protection of systems may divert management’s time and energy and increase costs.  In addition, it sells and installs software products that may contain design defects or encounter complications when interfacing with customers’ existing technologies, and it acknowledges that uncertain and rapidly evolving health information technology regulations could require changes to system configurations and competitive positioning.  Cybersecurity risks—including attempted or successful cyber‐attacks, privacy or data security incidents, misappropriation of protected personal information or proprietary data, hardware or software defects and third‐party vendor vulnerabilities, as well as heightened exposure from increased remote working—pose threats to system availability and confidentiality; accordingly, the company has programs to detect, contain and respond to security incidents, provides employee awareness training, and remains subject to privacy and security frameworks such as HIPAA and GDPR, with any breach or non-compliance potentially resulting in operational disruptions, litigation, regulatory penalties and reputational harm.

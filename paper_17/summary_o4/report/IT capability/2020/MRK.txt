Merck’s disclosures emphasize that the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure and cloud service providers to conduct critical operations and that disruptions, degradation or manipulation of these IT systems through cyber-attacks, unauthorized third-party access or misuse could adversely affect key business processes — including manufacturing, research and sales — with potential loss of revenue or critical or sensitive information; following a 2017 network cyber-attack that disrupted its worldwide operations, Merck has implemented enhanced measures and an enterprise-wide effort to modernize its systems and improve resiliency and recoverability, but acknowledges continued vulnerability given the evolving nature of cyber threats and the limits of third-party providers’ security efforts. The company also continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes while recognizing that the expansion of digital channels and social media platforms presents additional risks of brand damage, information leakage and legal implications, and it monitors its data, IT and personnel usage of its systems to guard against these risks. Furthermore, in its Animal Health segment Merck has adopted digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring solutions, reflecting the broader trend of integrating digital technologies to coordinate assets, processes and interfirm transactions in support of its business strategies and operational goals.

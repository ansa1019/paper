The Company’s disclosures emphasize its reliance on robust technology infrastructures and processes to coordinate assets, internal operations and interfirm transactions in support of business strategies. Management acknowledges that future revenue growth “depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products, services and business models,” reflecting evolving IT capabilities to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology resources. The risk factors note that operations “are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions” and that the Company must “continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers,” highlighting the IT function’s competence to support business needs. The firm underscores investment in internal information technology systems and software platforms to “meet existing needs, as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers,” including data processing and storage from public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, and the development of mobile-compatible offerings. The commitment to information management capability is implicit in its description that it “hosts, collects, uses and retains large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and workforce data,” necessitating attention to accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access. Moreover, the Company recognizes that “the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems, including multiple technology platforms, data center infrastructure and network systems, are critical for reliable performance of our online services and internal functions.” It discloses substantial resources devoted to upgrading technology “that can be challenging to integrate with our existing systems,” and details cybersecurity risks, including social engineering, software bugs, insider threats, and open source vulnerabilities, which pose threats to information reliability and operational flexibility. The report also addresses digital-driven operational changes—“increased use of videoconferencing, the shift to working from home, and the complexity of resuming operations in our offices”—illustrating the interplay of IT deployment, connectivity and execution risks. Reliance on third-party vendors and developers to host customer data and deliver services further underscores the need for IT governance, data management, and strategic alignment to maintain competitive advantage, business transformation and firm performance.

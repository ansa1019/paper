Boeing discloses that it faces evolving security threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data and systems and therefore “maintains an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats,” recognizing that “certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm.”  The company further notes that it “manages information and information technology systems for certain customers” who face similar risks and that “business disruptions … including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures … any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and of our products and services.”  As part of its broader business transformation, Boeing states that “our information technology teams are evaluating opportunities to form or expand strategic partnerships with vendors that allow us to simplify and optimize our operations, and reduce overall costs,” and under its infrastructure pillar it is “assessing our overall facility requirements in light of reduced demand … and remote and virtual work opportunities for large numbers of our workforce,” reflecting an emphasis on technology-enabled operational flexibility and resilience.

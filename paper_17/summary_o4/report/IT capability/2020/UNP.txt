The Company discloses that it relies on information technology in all aspects of its business—including both internally managed and third-party operated technology systems—and emphasizes the need for sufficient capital to acquire, develop, implement, maintain, and upgrade these systems, such as positive train control (PTC) and its latest transportation control systems, to avoid competitive disadvantage. It reports significant investments in “technology and other” capital and records computer software costs, reflecting ongoing deployment of IT resources in support of operational efficiency, network capacity, and business strategies. Recognizing the criticality of information management capabilities, the Company devotes substantial resources to cybersecurity—monitoring, training, prevention, and planning—to protect its technology infrastructure and proprietary data from cyber-attacks, ransomware, supply-chain vulnerabilities, and zero-day exploits, which could otherwise disrupt safety, service, and financial performance. The Company also plans to leverage data and technological improvements to identify and mitigate safety and operational risks—including rail defect detection and crossing improvements—and to transform its network through structural and technological changes aimed at enhancing reliability, resource utilization, and productivity, thereby underscoring its evolving IT capability to coordinate assets, processes, and interfirm relationships.

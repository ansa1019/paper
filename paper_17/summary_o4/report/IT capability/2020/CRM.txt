Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial, health and other personal information, and any breaches in our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the internet, that cause unauthorized access to a customer’s data, our data or our IT systems, or the blockage or disablement of authorized access to our services, may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant reputational harm, legal exposure, liabilities and negative financial impact; we rely on security measures, business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks, to mitigate such cybersecurity risks, but frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach IT systems, the evolution of our internal IT systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, the acquisition of new companies requiring us to incorporate and secure more complex IT environments, and our limited control over third-party technology providers and the processing of data by such providers, increase the complexity of our IT environment and could adversely affect our ability to anticipate threats or address vulnerabilities; any interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business; our dependency on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties exposes us to the risk of network outages and delays that could reduce the availability of our internet-based services, while certain countries’ legislative or technological actions that regulate or limit access to the internet, as well as increased internet demand during the pandemic, could create access challenges; as we add data centers, expand capacity, move to cloud computing platform providers and transfer our data and our customers’ data, any disruption or damage to, or failure of, these systems or any unsuccessful data transfers may impair service delivery and harm our reputation and financial results; our global work-from-home operating environment, accelerated upgrades or replacements of our software systems, and our efforts to integrate acquired technologies into our existing platforms and augment them to meet our quality standards, have strained our personnel resources, infrastructure capacity, operational processes and security measures, which could adversely affect productivity, our ability to develop and support products and services, and our overall operational efficiency; moreover, any failure to accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements or to hire, retain and manage key development and operations personnel could result in performance degradation, service outages, defects or disruptions in our services, diminished demand and substantial liability.

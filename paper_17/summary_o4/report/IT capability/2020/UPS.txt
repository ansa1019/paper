We rely heavily on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and a number of internally developed systems and applications, to manage and support a wide variety of business processes and activities throughout our operations; for example, we rely on information technology to receive package‐level information in advance of physical receipt of packages, to track items through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. Our franchise locations and acquired businesses similarly depend on these systems to support their activities, and the operation of our networks involves the collection, storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary and sensitive or confidential data. To conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders and are therefore subject to a variety of continuously evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and information security, the scope of which is often uncertain or conflicting. These information technology systems—including those of our franchisees, acquired businesses and third‐party service providers such as cloud service providers and delivery partners—are susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by programming errors, defects or other vulnerabilities, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, ransomware, malware, theft, insider misconduct, telecommunications failures, human error or other catastrophic events, and hackers, foreign governments, cyber-terrorists and cyber-criminals may launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks that could cause outages, unauthorized access, misuse or blockage of legitimate access to systems or information. We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans, but our security processes, protocols and standards and the contractual measures we impose on third parties may not be sufficient to prevent such events, which could materially adversely affect our operations, expose us to litigation, fines or regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation and customer confidence, and necessitate significant additional effort and expense. In our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, we note that we are enhancing our digital access program into e-commerce platforms and investing in technology initiatives and additional network capabilities—including capital expenditures on internally developed software—to improve speed, ease of access, connectivity and operational efficiency, all of which underscore our strategy of leveraging information technology resources to support business needs, enable process optimization and sustain competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market environment.

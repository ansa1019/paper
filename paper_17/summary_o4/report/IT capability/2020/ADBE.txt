The report discloses that “this global work-from-home operating environment has caused strain for, and may adversely impact the productivity of, certain employees,” reflecting the need to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources to support remote work, and observes that “conditions caused by the pandemic have affected the rate of IT spending and may continue to adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our offerings,” underscoring how external influences, resource allocation and technology investment affect market dynamics and firm capability. It further states “we rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services,” and that “we do not have redundancy for all of our systems… and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities,” highlighting infrastructure capability, operational flexibility and IT architecture considerations. The risk of “hardware or software failures or errors… could result in data loss or corruption… or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels,” and that “our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by… failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic,” speaks directly to information management capability—accuracy, timeliness, reliability and connectivity. In recognition of security governance, the filing warns that “security vulnerabilities in our products and systems, or in our supply chain, could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims,” and describes investments in “code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities, reviewing our service providers' security controls, reviewing and auditing our hosted services against independent security control frameworks,” each illustrating the firm’s competence in IT governance and technology deployment. In the revenue recognition discussion, Adobe explains that its creative and document cloud offerings integrate “on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services… to provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either… on their own,” and highlights cloud-based features such as “creative cloud libraries,” “shared reviews,” “automatic cloud rendering” and Sensei’s “artificial intelligence and machine learning framework,” demonstrating how IT capabilities support, enhance and transform business processes. Finally, the MD&A notes that research and development investments include “recruiting and hiring of software developers” and “capital expenditures… to fund our San Jose and Bangalore construction projects,” evidencing the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of its strategies, and in sales and marketing the company describes “the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment,” illustrating how IT capability underpins competitive advantage and customer value.

Our operations rely on a pervasive information technology infrastructure and capability that spans proprietary and third-party computer hardware systems, cloud computing services and content delivery networks to support and enhance our streaming platform, recommendation and merchandising algorithms, and business processes. We have architected our software and systems to utilize data processing, storage and distributed computing services provided by Amazon Web Services, and we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS, with limited ability to switch providers, highlighting our operational dependence on scalable cloud architecture. We have built and deployed our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) and utilize third-party networks to ensure efficient, high-volume streaming, and we continually develop and maintain technology and infrastructure to scale our service reliably in line with membership growth and feature enhancements. Our use of technology extends to marketing and customer acquisition through digital and social media platforms, complex multi-method payment processing systems subject to regulatory and security requirements, and remote-work enabling tools that support a largely home-based workforce. We face continuous cybersecurity and operational risks, including unauthorized access or disruption of our systems and third-party providers, which could impair service availability, data confidentiality or integrity, expose us to privacy or regulatory liability under GDPR, CCPA and other data protection laws, and damage our reputation. We regularly monitor, update and invest in security protocols, encryption and authentication technologies, and maintain data management and governance practices to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks, protect member information, and support our digital transformation efforts.

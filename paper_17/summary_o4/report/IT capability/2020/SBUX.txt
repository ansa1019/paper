Many of our information technology systems—including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs, as well as administrative functions—are interdependent across our operations for processes such as supply chain management, Starbucks Card management, mobile ordering apps, loyalty functionality and other transactions and contain personal, financial or proprietary information. We rely heavily on these systems to support administrative functions, payment processing in our stores and online, our mobile and delivery services and customer-facing digital relationships that drive incremental traffic and spend, and have accelerated our transformation of store formats—particularly convenience-led formats—based on mobile ordering capabilities in response to evolving customer behaviors. We recognize that any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of our information technology infrastructure—whether through cyber-attacks, flaws in third-party software or services, inadequate redundancy, power outages or other causes—could result in unauthorized access to or loss of customer or partner data, disrupt our operations, impair our reputation, expose us to significant liability, regulatory penalties under evolving global privacy and cybersecurity regimes such as the GDPR and CCPA, and require substantial remediation investments in additional security technologies, personnel and third-party services. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate cyber-attacks, prevent or minimize breaches and support our long-term growth initiatives.

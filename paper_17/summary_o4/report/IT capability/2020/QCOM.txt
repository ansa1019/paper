Although the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our workforce practices, such as having the vast majority of our employees working from home, we have not experienced a significant negative impact to our business or results of operations; third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, and many such attempts are increasingly more sophisticated; these attempts include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, and impersonating authorized users; we may also be subject to ransom-style cyber-attacks, which could impact our information technology systems and cause widespread disruption to our business, including our manufacturing operations, and expose our confidential or proprietary information; in addition, third parties that we may rely on to store or process our confidential information may also be subject to similar threats; such threats could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property or the proprietary, confidential or personal information of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our information technology systems; these threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventive measures; we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems or other attacks may be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects; similarly, employees and former employees have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information; we also provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees and certain of our consultants, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use or disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors; we also provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to certain of our joint venture partners, including those affiliated with state actors and those in foreign jurisdictions where ownership restrictions may require us to take a minority ownership interest in the joint venture, and such joint venture partners may wrongfully use or disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors; the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our technology, intellectual property or the proprietary, confidential or personal information of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings and otherwise adversely affect our business; we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology systems and our technology, intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information; further, China has implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity laws that require our overall information technology security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified, which are complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation, and our efforts to comply with such laws may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.

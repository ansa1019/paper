NVIDIA’s IT capability encompasses a third-party-supported IT infrastructure for business management and communication software products and critical software development tools used for the design, simulation and verification of new products or enhancements to bring advanced features to market in a timely manner, though in the past delays have occurred when available tools could not fully simulate complex features and functionalities. The company relies on extensive data center capacity, cloud computing instances with major providers and networking and edge-AI platforms—including GPU-based accelerated computing systems, DPUs and virtualization solutions—to support high-performance computing, AI, professional visualization, autonomous driving and service delivery. To defend against evolving cyber threats such as malware, phishing and attacks by experienced programmers, hackers or compromised third-party providers like SolarWinds, NVIDIA continuously engineers more secure products, enhances reliability features, develops and enforces security measures across internal systems and supplier networks, and meets evolving customer security requirements to safeguard data accuracy, timeliness, reliability, confidentiality, connectivity and access. Actual or perceived breaches of security measures or accidental loss or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary or sensitive data about NVIDIA, its partners or customers could expose the company to litigation, regulatory inquiries and reputational harm. Operational resilience of its IT systems is critical, as business disruptions from telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, natural disasters, pandemics or geopolitical events—or impacts on third-party vendors providing critical IT and research-and-development infrastructure services—could impair order fulfillment, interrupt other critical functions and adversely affect revenue, costs and global operations.

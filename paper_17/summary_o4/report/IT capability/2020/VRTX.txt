Vertex Pharmaceuticals maintains and relies extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of its business and collects, stores and transmits confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property) that must be maintained with appropriate levels of confidentiality, integrity and security. The size and complexity of these information technology and information security systems makes them potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or security breaches resulting from software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or other events, any of which could cause loss of critical data, significant operational interruption or subject the company to private and governmental causes of action. Although Vertex has implemented security measures and adopted a business continuity plan to address disruptions to its information technology systems and to mobilize resources in response to crises, there can be no assurance that these safeguards will prevent breakdowns or breaches that could materially adversely affect the business. The widespread shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic further increases the risk of cybersecurity-related events, including phishing attacks and other security threats as employees, third-party vendors and collaborators operate from non-corporate managed networks. In addition, Vertex is subject to various and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal data, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and other state and federal privacy and data-protection statutes, which impose significant compliance obligations for data collection, use, disclosure, breach notification, consent, transparency and cross-border transfers and carry the possibility of substantial fines, criminal penalties and reputational harm if not met. The companyâ€™s global privacy program and contractual arrangements with processors seek to address these requirements, but may prove insufficient to avoid enforcement actions. Furthermore, the EU Clinical Trial Regulation and EMA policy on publication of clinical data will permit public dissemination of clinical information submitted in marketing authorization applications, potentially exposing sensitive trial results to enhanced scrutiny and risking commercial confidentiality, while use of social media platforms may lead to unintentional public disclosure of sensitive or regulated information and complicate compliance with applicable laws.

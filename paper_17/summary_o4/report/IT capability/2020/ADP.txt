ADP’s reliance on its payroll, financial, accounting and other data-processing systems underscores the critical need to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure its technology resources in support of business strategies and work processes; accordingly, the company continually upgrades, enhances and expands its systems, applications and solutions—including significant investments in systems development and programming, next-generation platforms and digital implementation and servicing initiatives—to ensure they properly support its businesses, meet evolving client needs, and maintain competitive advantage. Failure of any such system or solution, whether due to errors, defects, malevolent acts or other factors, could disrupt operations, damage its reputation and materially impair financial results, so ADP maintains disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and operates both internally managed and third-party data centers and cloud-computing services. The firm devotes substantial resources to information security and controls—programs to prevent, detect and respond to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats such as unauthorized intrusions, malware, phishing and social-engineering—and continuously updates its hardware, software and third-party applications to guard the confidentiality, integrity, availability, connectivity and access of data. Its information management capability encompasses the collection, storage, hosting, transfer, processing, disclosure, use, retention and destruction of personal and business information in compliance with extensive privacy, data protection and cyber-security laws, while its strategic use of digital technologies, data analytics and IT governance practices enables operational efficiency, agility and resilience in a dynamic market environment.

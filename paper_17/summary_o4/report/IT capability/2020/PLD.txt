During the COVID-19 environment our disclosures highlight the role of information technology in supporting business continuity and decision making, noting that “our business continuity, communication plans and technology are allowing all functions of our business to work smoothly,” aided by insights from “proprietary data” on demand; our employees “have continued working remotely or in certain locations in our offices” under health and safety protocols enabled by our IT infrastructure and support systems; we maintain system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan for “internal and hosted information technology systems,” yet acknowledge that those systems remain “vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, such as computer viruses or unauthorized access”; any “system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business,” and any security compromise could lead to “unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business,” underscoring the importance of our IT capability in managing remote work, customer engagement and operational resilience in an uncertain environment.

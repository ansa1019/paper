Nike’s 2020 Form 10-K explicitly highlights “difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining Nike’s increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security,” and it warns that “operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, as a result of extended workforce remote work arrangements” may impair its operations. The company states that it is “heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services, across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities,” and cautions that any failure, inadequacy or interruption of those systems “could harm our ability to effectively operate our business,” cause “delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency,” require “significant capital investments to remediate the problem,” and adversely affect its reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Nike reports that “over a number of years, we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate” and that its “work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing,” but notes that “problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems” could exacerbate such risks. The filing also underscores reliance on IT for customer-facing digital commerce, stating that “if the technology-based systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base, could be materially adversely affected,” and that “if we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline.” It further describes its investments in “digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our Nike Direct operations,” noting these “digital offerings will require continued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms” and that these platforms “must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks and standards that we do not control.” On the financial reporting side, Nike relies on IT systems “to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements,” warning that a severe system disruption “could result in delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage.” The company also emphasizes the critical nature of data security, cautioning that “any breach of our or our service providers’ network, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers’, users’ or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business,” and acknowledges the “significant resources” required to “protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach.” Finally, Nike recognizes the burden of privacy and data protection regulation—referencing GDPR and CCPA—and states that “compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws … can be costly and time consuming, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks.” In its management discussion, the company outlines strategic plans to “unify investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation” and confirms ongoing investment in “end-to-end digital capabilities,” including enterprise resource planning tools to support global operations.

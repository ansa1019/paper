The report cautions that extended periods of remote working “could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk,” since “remote working environments are less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the covid-19 pandemic.” It emphasizes our reliance on “financial, accounting and other data processing systems and on the systems of third parties who provide services to us,” warning that failures or disruptions in such systems could lead to “errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions,” “liability to our funds,” “regulatory intervention” or “reputational damage.” It further observes that “our and our third-party service providers’ information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, may not be able to adequately protect the information of our individual fund investors or global atlantic’s policyholders, may not be suitable for new products and strategies … and may be subject to security risks,” and that the “cost of maintaining such systems and technology may increase.” The 10-K identifies cyber-security as a top priority for regulators worldwide and warns that “breaches in security could potentially jeopardize our, our employees’, our fund investors’, global atlantic policyholders’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information … which could result in significant losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to our fund investors and other counterparties, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.” It also notes that “we rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks” and that ongoing “cyber-security threats to and attacks on our information technology infrastructure” create a sustained risk of unauthorized access, theft or misuse of data.

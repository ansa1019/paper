The report discloses that a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect the company’s business and notes that it relies extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data—ranging from sales, customer and associate data to demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer service and post-purchase matters. It emphasizes that for these systems, applications and processes to operate effectively, the company or its third-party service providers, including cloud platform vendors, must maintain, update, upgrade and patch them, and that delays or design, usage or maintenance errors can impair effectiveness or expose the company to significant security risks. It recognizes that its own systems and those with which it interacts have on occasion experienced damage or interruption from critical infrastructure outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, data theft or misuse, cyber-attacks (including malware, phishing, denial of service and ransomware), uncontrollable natural or public health disasters, acts of war or terrorism, inadequate redundancy, and malfeasance by associates, contractors or service providers. The company is making and intends to continue substantial investments in its information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel—sometimes with strategic partners and third parties—including replacing legacy systems with more flexible successor systems, migrating applications to the cloud, outsourcing technology, enhancing existing systems and designing or acquiring new functionality—while acknowledging that these efforts carry risks of system failures, data loss or corruption, changes in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns, implementation delays or errors, operational disruptions and potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. It warns that any implementation or transition difficulties may result in operational challenges, security failures, reputational harm and increased costs. The company further cautions that disruptions, delays or failures in its customer-facing technology systems could impair its interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences, particularly as it uses digital platforms both as sales channels and as methods of providing product, project and other information, maintains online communities and knowledge centers, and continually seeks to enhance its online and digital properties to deliver an attractive, user-friendly interface. The company’s acceptance of multiple electronic payment methods subjects it to complex rules, regulations, contractual obligations and certification requirements and exposes it to potential fraud, theft or liability if its or its payment processors’ systems are compromised. It underscores that its information systems and those of third-party service providers face an evolving threat landscape of data protection and cybersecurity risks, with unauthorized access already occurring through deceptive means, software defects or potential back-doors, and that the methods of attack frequently change and may not produce immediate indications of compromise, necessitating constant evaluation and adaptation of systems, processes and overall security environments, including for acquired entities, without guarantee that such measures will fully prevent data breaches or governance failures that could result in substantial costs, fines, litigation, lost sales or reputational damage. The company also notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated customer demand for online purchases, required rapid technology modifications—such as curbside pickup—and shifted store support operations to remote work, thereby further heightening risks related to internal and external IT infrastructure failures and cybersecurity threats. Finally, in describing its strategic One Home Depot experience and “build one supply chain” initiatives, the company states that it has substantially increased investments in operations and information technology systems, the development and execution of new processes and support, employment of web-based tools and services, and management of third-party service providers, and that failure to choose or implement these investments, technologies and process redesigns in the right manner, at the right pace or cost could disrupt operations, reduce efficiency, impair product availability, damage the customer experience and materially and adversely affect its business operations, financial results and competitive positioning.

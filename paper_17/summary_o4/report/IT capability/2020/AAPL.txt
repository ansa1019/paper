The company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely and continues to monitor and adapt its operations in accordance with relevant authorities, relying on its information systems capability to support business continuity. It acknowledges exposure to information technology system failures, network disruptions and security breaches and warns that its system redundancy and disaster-recovery planning may prove ineffective or inadequate, potentially preventing access to online services, impeding customer transactions or disrupting manufacturing and shipping processes. The company devotes significant resources to network and data security—including encryption, authentication and monitoring systems to detect unusual activity and freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances—and has implemented processes and governance practices designed to secure its IT systems, protect personally identifiable information and comply with evolving federal, state and international laws on privacy, data security, data localization and digital platforms, although it recognizes these measures cannot provide absolute security. Given its reliance on third-party digital content and software developers, the company contracts for digital rights management and other security solutions, supports its App Store ecosystem to encourage timely development and maintenance of applications, and depends on these digital partnerships and its own security and monitoring capabilities to maintain operational flexibility, connectivity, compliance and competitive advantage.

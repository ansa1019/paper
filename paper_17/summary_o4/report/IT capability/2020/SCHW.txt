Certain of our client service response and processing times have increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients have experienced and continue to occasionally experience delays accessing and using our website and mobile applications, and many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers are working remotely, which has at times contributed to the increase in response and processing times, particularly when we have experienced the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers. The COVID-19 pandemic could make the timely achievement of our TD Ameritrade integration milestones more challenging, particularly with regard to technology and systems. We must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures, and our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and stress testing, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time, and it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses, decreased client satisfaction, reputational damage, and regulatory inquiries. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses, market makers, dealers, and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement, and system failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, cancelled orders, substantial losses for us and for our clients, claims from our clients for damages, and reputational harm. We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions, and any significant failures by them—including improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information—could cause us to incur losses and harm our reputation, while an interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, natural disasters, public health crises or political developments, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to us. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations. Our business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us, and our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, ransomware, and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources; data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct. Given the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack. Security breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures, and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. Most of the integration planning and execution work is currently being done remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the inability to work in-person and on-site with information technology and management oversight could make some of the integration work more challenging, particularly with regard to technology; we will need to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff and rely on a number of critical technology vendors in order to complete the integration work relating to technology platforms and systems within the target timeframe, and we may experience delays in acquiring the technology and infrastructure components needed for the integration due to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, while sustained high levels of trading volume may require us to increase the capacity in our integration technology build-outs.

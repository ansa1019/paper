The company discloses that it relies extensively on information technology systems and related networks and services—such as internet sites, cloud and SaaS solutions, data hosting and processing facilities, and other hardware, software and technical platforms, some of which are managed or hosted by third parties—to conduct its business, and it has made investments in monitoring these networks and systems, hiring experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers; however, it acknowledges that numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats to its IT systems, networks and product offerings, compounded by an increased remote workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, pose risks to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data and could expose it to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The report further warns that damage to or failure of its IT systems, networks or service providers—whether from catastrophic events, power outages, improper data handling or security breaches—could impair its ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices, track payments or otherwise operate effectively, and it emphasizes that its business continuity plans may not fully address such failures in a timely manner. The company is implementing a new global enterprise resource planning system to replace many existing operating and financial systems and cautions that any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design or implementation of this system could adversely affect its core business processes. In addition, through its acquisition of Orthosensor, described as a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for total joint replacement, the company underscores its focus on digital technologies. Finally, the report highlights the complexities of complying with global privacy, data protection and security regulations—including HIPAA, the HITECH Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation—which impose comprehensive standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of personal data and carry significant penalties for non-compliance.

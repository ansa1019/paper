Berkshire and its subsidiaries rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of their business operations, recognizing that IT systems coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions and underpin critical functions such as decision‐making, financial activities and regulatory compliance.  The Risk Factors section discloses that certain information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious code, unauthorized access, phishing, denial‐of‐service attacks and other cyber‐attacks that could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties.  In mitigation, the company has adopted business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis and has implemented measures such as remote‐access capabilities, work‐from‐home arrangements, staggered or reduced work schedules, elimination of nonessential travel, enhanced network connectivity controls and remote user support to maintain operational flexibility and resilience.  Berkshire further warns that if it is unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage, underscoring the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT‐based resources in combination with other strategic resources to support business needs, drive innovation and sustain competitive advantage.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has rapidly deployed and reconfigured its digital infrastructure and operational processes—requiring team members to work from home where possible, upgrading site access and thermal‐screening systems, enforcing physical‐distancing and cohort separation protocols, and limiting business travel—to ensure health and safety while maintaining business continuity; it has evaluated and reshaped its global supply chain, adding alternative suppliers, increasing on-hand inventory of critical materials, and expanding assembly and test capacity through its captive network and third-party partners to preserve continuity of manufacturing and resource allocation. The Company maintains formal controls over the physical security of its facilities and over network systems, data centers, and information repositories that process, store, and transmit large volumes of customer, employee, and proprietary data subject to confidentiality, integrity, availability, and access requirements; it recognizes that unauthorized access, cyber incidents, or deployment of malicious software could disrupt operations, compromise trade secrets or confidential information, damage its reputation, and expose it to litigation. Its business resilience strategies include dynamic adjustments to discretionary spending and capital commitments, compliance with evolving government directives and international trade regulations (such as export controls and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and the mobilization of technology resources to support remote connectivity, operational flexibility, compliance, and market responsiveness amid rapidly changing economic, regulatory, and competitive environments.

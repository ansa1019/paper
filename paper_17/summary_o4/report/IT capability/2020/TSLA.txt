The report describes the need to scale and refine information technology systems—including product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management and financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems—through new internally developed platforms and global deployments, underscoring the coordination of digital resources in support of manufacturing, delivery and service operations. It acknowledges that implementing, maintaining, segregating and updating these systems demands significant management effort, cost and support while posing inherent risks of operational disruption, impaired data and inventory controls, delays in financial reporting, deficiencies in internal controls and failure to secure intellectual property and customer information against cyber-attacks, data breaches, sabotage or misappropriation. The company further highlights that its products embed complex IT architectures and built-in connectivity for remote updates, which, if not functioning as expected or if subject to unauthorized access or manipulation, could undermine information reliability, customer trust, system functionality and regulatory compliance and may require substantial corrective investments or alternative solutions. Furthermore, maintenance of information security measures and IT governance is positioned as critical to safeguarding strategic resources, ensuring flexibility in responding to evolving business needs and leveraging IT capability in combination with other organizational assets to support competitive positioning and operational efficiency.

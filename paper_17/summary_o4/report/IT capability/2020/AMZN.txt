Amazon’s 10-K disclosures reflect a concerted effort to develop and mobilize IT capability by investing heavily in technology and content resources—highlighting payroll and related expenses for computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees; infrastructure costs for servers, networking equipment, data center depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses; and capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. The company reports that as it rapidly expands its global operations and scales its infrastructure to support its retail, services, fulfillment, and data center networks, it is continually adding software and hardware, upgrading its systems and network infrastructure, optimizing its fulfillment network, and enhancing stability, efficiency, operational flexibility, and process automation—particularly within AWS’s broad set of on-demand technology services including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning. Amazon acknowledges that failures or delays in its computer and communications systems—stemming from natural or man-made disasters, capacity limitations, security breaches, or third-party technology or vendor issues—can cause system interruptions, service unavailability, and loss of critical data, noting that its systems are not fully redundant and its disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. The Company further emphasizes reliance on third-party technology and systems for encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions, underscoring the importance of data management, information security, connectivity, and reliability to support business strategies, regulatory compliance, and competitive differentiation.

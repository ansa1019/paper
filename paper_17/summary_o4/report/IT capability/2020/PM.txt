The Company increasingly relies on information systems and digital platforms to help manage business processes, collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, consumers and customers, and it engages third-party service providers and maintains backup systems and business continuity plans along with internal specialists to protect these systems and data; however, the failure of these information systems to function as intended or their penetration with the intent to extract or corrupt information, or the failure to adhere to strict data governance and cybersecurity protocols and to comply with privacy laws and regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, could result in business disruption, loss of reputation, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other confidential data, with the magnitude of these risks likely to increase as the Company relies more heavily on digital platforms and as privacy laws become more stringent. The Company also increasingly relies on third-party resources to support its finance and information technology processes, which, while improving efficiencies and decreasing operating costs, diminish its direct control and may adversely affect product or service quality, supply chain performance and the speed and flexibility of its response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences, potentially placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage and increasing costs if it must replace such third parties with its own resources. In addition, the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about the Companyâ€™s reduced-risk products, underscoring the critical importance of effective information management capability, cybersecurity, data governance and digital infrastructure in protecting business performance, brand integrity and regulatory compliance.

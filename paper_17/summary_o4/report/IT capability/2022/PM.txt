The report discloses a range of policies and practices that support the maintenance of operations and preservation of performance under adverse conditions, including continuously assessing rapidly evolving geopolitical risks, such as the suspension and resumption of commercial and manufacturing activities in Ukraine and Russia, the payment of employee salaries and provision of humanitarian aid despite suspended operations, and the development of contingency plans “as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop.” It describes business continuity plans and other safeguards intended to mitigate the impact of natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics (notably COVID-19-related closures and supply chain shortages of key components), climate-driven agricultural variability, regulatory constraints, and cybersecurity attacks, while acknowledging that such measures “might not always be effective to fully mitigate their impact.” The Company further details reliance on third-party distributors, manufacturers and service providers—diminishing direct control over product availability and quality—along with initiatives to establish environmental goals, secure alternative supply sources and invest in administrative, technical and physical safeguards to preserve system integrity, operational flexibility and the speed of response to changing market conditions. Concurrently, strategic organizational changes, including geographic segment realignments, acquisitions and integration efforts, are described as aimed at reinforcing consumer centricity, accelerating innovation and sustaining performance under uncertainty, while acknowledging the inherent unpredictability of regulatory approvals, currency fluctuations, tax and trade regimes, and talent retention in turbulent markets.

The organization’s ability to maintain integrity, functioning and performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional pressures is reflected in risk disclosures of “operational failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our products or services” that could harm the business or cause loss of clients and in the acknowledgment that “we may not be able to successfully or quickly recover all of our critical business functions, assets and data through our business continuity program.” The company highlights its robust information security and controls investments to counter constantly evolving unauthorized access attempts, while noting “we cannot be certain that the security measures and procedures … will be successful or sufficient to counter all current and emerging risks and threats.” Supply chain resilience is addressed by identifying potential workforce shortages, shipping delays, increased lead times and higher costs for materials and components, and by recognizing dependence on third-party products and services whose underperformance could materially affect operations. The interconnected nature of global financial system participants underscores systemic vulnerability, where disruptions at any node may impair the firm’s ability to deliver products and services, despite inter-organizational collaboration to mitigate such risks. Pandemic- and geopolitical-related volatility, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, political conflicts and regulatory changes, are cited as amplifying other risk factors, intensifying economic uncertainty and financial market volatility and challenging the firm to adapt, reconfigure operational parameters and allocate resources to maintain continuity. In response, the company emphasizes strategic initiatives such as operating system integrations, technology modernization, targeted innovation and disciplined capital allocation to strengthen operational flexibility, competitive advantage and the capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger from adversity.

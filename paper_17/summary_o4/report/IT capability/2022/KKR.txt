While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we can provide no assurance, and we make no representation, that our mitigation efforts will be successful. During periods of difficult market or economic conditions or events, the various companies or assets in which we have investments may experience several negative consequences, including decreased revenues, increased costs, credit rating downgrades, difficulty in obtaining financing and even severe financial losses or insolvency, and any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems and on the systems of third parties who provide services to us, and if any of these systems do not operate properly, are disabled or not appropriately updated, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our various investment vehicles, regulatory intervention, fines, sanctions or reputational damage. A disaster, disruption, error or inability to operate or provide any of these services by us, our vendors or other counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption, and our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. Cyber-security failures and data security breaches may disrupt or have a material adverse impact on our businesses, operations and investments, including by jeopardizing confidential information, and while we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, malware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other sophisticated threats. Public health crises, pandemics and epidemics, such as those caused by new strains of viruses like H5N1, SARS and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), may occur from time to time, which could directly and indirectly impact us and our portfolio companies in material respects by threatening our and their employees’ well-being and morale, interrupting business activities, supply chains and transactional activities, disrupting travel, and negatively impacting the economies of the affected countries or regions, and it is impossible to predict with certainty the possible future business and economic ramifications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health crisis, pandemic or epidemic, including potential adverse impacts on operational risks, employee productivity, liquidity and market volatility. We have significant liquidity requirements, and adverse market and economic conditions may adversely affect our sources of liquidity, which could force us to sell assets or seek to raise debt or equity capital on unfavorable terms. Our capital markets activities expose us to material risks such that, if counterparties fail to acquire or pay for the loans, securities or other financial instruments we expected to sell, place or syndicate to them, we may incur significant losses and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. We face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions, reliance on manual processes in certain circumstances and transactions not being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted for in our various investment vehicles. We may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses and new types of investors, each of which may result in additional risks, including heightened regulatory and compliance burdens, increased scrutiny, oversight and controls, greater operational complexity and cost and challenges integrating new businesses or investment structures. Various economic conditions and events outside of our control that are difficult to quantify or predict—including shifts in interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices, supply and demand imbalances, monetary and fiscal policy changes, geopolitical conflicts, trade sanctions, natural disasters and public health crises—may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on our results of operations and financial condition, in each case potentially impeding our ability to maintain or restore positive performance under challenging conditions.

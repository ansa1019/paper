Blackstone acknowledges that difficult market and economic environments, including record inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions and global health crises, can materially impair its business and “adversely affect our performance,” and that in response it may need to reconfigure resources “in order to maintain profitability,” reducing fixed costs, re‐deploying capital, cutting back services or personnel and realigning its operating model to preserve or improve performance under challenging conditions. The firm describes its “disaster recovery and business continuity programs,” warns that these efforts “may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm” from infrastructure disruptions such as cyberattacks or pandemic‐related restrictions, and notes the importance of anticipating and assessing evolving risks—from labor shortages and supply chain fragmentation to regulatory and tax changes—to protect its liquidity, operations and culture. Blackstone also details measures to manage exposure through derivative risk mitigation strategies, covenant‐compliant borrowing under committed facilities, and proactive adjustments to fee structures, while emphasizing the need for ongoing operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and strategic foresight to sustain integrity and performance, at least partially, through internal or external disturbances.

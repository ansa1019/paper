The risk factors section discloses that the company’s business operations, including its supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters, pandemics or other events beyond its control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for its products if its crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues; that the deadly conflict in Ukraine has produced volatile commodity markets, supply-chain disruptions, increased cyber-incident risks, labor shortages, limitations on credit access, elevated input costs and health and safety hazards and could result in asset losses or impairment charges; that consumer preferences continuously evolve in response to demographic shifts, channel changes, pricing, product quality and environmental or health concerns—necessitating investments in data analytics, innovation and strategic response mechanisms to anticipate and adapt to such shifts; that damage to reputation or brand image stemming from failures in ethical, environmental, social or product safety practices can erode consumer confidence and hinder business continuity; and that manufacturing disruptions and raw-material volatility—driven by weather, labor constraints, geopolitical tensions or regulatory actions—can interrupt supply, increase costs and impair performance under pressure. In the discussion of strategy, the company describes pep+ as an end-to-end business transformation centered on sustainability and human capital to restore agricultural lands, achieve net-zero emissions, become net water positive and scale reusable-model packaging, thereby illustrating a systemic approach to resilience and adaptation. Management further outlines an integrated risk management framework overseen by the Board and its committees, supported by the PepsiCo Risk Committee, division and market risk committees, a centralized Risk Management Office, Internal Audit, Compliance & Ethics and a Disclosure Committee, which collectively identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate top strategic, financial, operational, compliance, safety and reputational risks. The framework leverages productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs, hedging, network security, disaster recovery and phased enterprise-wide system migrations to allocate resources, maintain operational flexibility and preserve business continuity in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment.

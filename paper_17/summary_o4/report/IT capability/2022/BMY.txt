We disclose that our product supply and patient access depend on a resilient manufacturing and distribution network and that we could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in our supply chain as well as in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products, including product seizures or recalls, compliance failures, manufacturing shutdowns, supplier failures, regulatory approval delays, capacity limits and unforeseeable events such as natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism that affect one or more of our facilities or critical suppliers. We recognize that our ability to source raw materials and supplies used to manufacture novel therapies like CAR-T cell therapies and to develop consistent and reliable manufacturing processes and distribution networks with an attractive cost of goods is central to preserving or improving functioning despite internal or external disturbances. We rely on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, co-promote and sell our products and to manage key business services, and acknowledge that failure of any critical third party to meet its obligations—including to adequately deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis—could have a material adverse impact on our operations. We are dependent on information technology systems, networks and services that face risks of breakdown, corruption or interruption, including from cyber-attacks, ransomware and social engineering, and we have invested in protections and monitoring practices, but there can be no assurance that continuing efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches that could adversely affect our business. We have adopted governance processes, policies and inventory monitoring procedures under a 2004 SEC consent order to limit direct customer sales to approximately one month of inventory on hand and escalate potential compliance concerns, thereby safeguarding our distribution integrity. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adopted procedures to ensure continued supply of our medicines and protect workforce health, acknowledging that future pandemics or geopolitical events may similarly disrupt patient access, clinical development and manufacturing continuity. We recognize that adverse changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions, including currency fluctuations, inflation, global downturns, and increased pricing pressure and regulation, could amplify operational and financial risks and require adaptation of our pricing, reimbursement and market access strategies. We regularly assess working capital needs, debt leverage, capital expenditures, dividend and share repurchase programs, and the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and we regularly evaluate our capital structure to ensure financial risks are managed, liquidity is accessible and cost of capital remains efficient in order to maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. We employ significant judgment in acquisition accounting, intangible asset valuations, impairment assessments, revenue recognition estimates, contingency accruals, and tax valuation allowances, and acknowledge that these critical accounting policies and judgments, in addition to our ongoing research and development portfolio management and alliance collaborations, are essential to absorb strain and preserve performance under challenging conditions.

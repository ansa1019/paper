The company discloses that its ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its operations and the communities in which it operates, including natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, terrorism, political unrest, pandemics or government containment measures, and that its disaster recovery plans—with backup facilities for primary data centers—are not always fully redundant or effective. It acknowledges reliance on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other data in its own systems and those of third-party vendors and warns that cyber attacks, data breaches, software vulnerabilities, unauthorized disclosures, insider misconduct or evolving attack techniques could cause material interruptions or malfunctions, compromise confidentiality and integrity of information, damage its brand and reputation, result in litigation or regulatory actions, and require significant remediation resources. The company further recognizes risks associated with integrating third-party software and services—including cloud-based infrastructure—whose shortcomings, failures or incompatibilities may disrupt operations, that outsourcing key functions may expose it to vendor nonperformance or security lapses, and that its business continuity depends on the availability of personnel, office facilities and properly functioning computer and telecommunications systems. It warns that public health crises, extreme weather events driven by climate change, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions can introduce volatility and uncertainty into capital and commodities markets, increase costs, constrain customer budgets, pressure renewals of subscription-based products and delay new sales, while measures taken to avoid or mitigate such incidents may be expensive, insufficient, circumvented or become obsolete. The company also notes that integration of acquisitions may divert management attention, incur unanticipated costs, heighten cyber-security and operational risks, and impede achievement of expected synergies. Taken together, these disclosures describe a multifaceted set of processes—risk assessment, resource allocation, system backups, third-party management, contingency planning and adaptive investment—intended to preserve or restore organizational functioning and performance under internal or external disturbances, unexpected conditions and adverse events.

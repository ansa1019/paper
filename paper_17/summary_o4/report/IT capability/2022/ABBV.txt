In response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, AbbVie suspended operations for all aesthetics products in Russia but continued the sale of essential pharmaceutical products to help ensure patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines and announced that all profits from those sales would be donated to support humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine. AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines, regularly modifying its business practices and taking further actions as required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of its employees, patients, customers and business partners. The COVID-19 pandemic caused many countries to implement travel bans and shelter-in-place orders, and while the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie’s operations to date has not been material, AbbVie experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets and continues to adapt its manufacturing, supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations in response to evolving public health outbreaks. AbbVie’s business interruption insurance and reliance on third-party service providers expose it to risks associated with interruptions in the supply of raw materials and components, legal and regulatory compliance failures, environmental factors and the failure of critical providers to meet their obligations, any of which could impair AbbVie’s ability to deliver products to customers on a timely basis. To remain competitive and mitigate risks related to patent expiration, biosimilar competition, regulatory changes and third-party collaborations, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development, vigorously defends its intellectual property rights, implements integration plans to optimize combined operations following significant acquisitions, and invests in broadening its product portfolio and pipeline. AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition through cost synergies and integration initiatives, ensuring commercial execution of new product launches, maintaining broad formulary access for key products, and returning value to shareholders while supporting sustainable growth. In managing regulatory pressures and potential business disruptions, AbbVie incurs ongoing expenses to ensure compliance with complex global regulations, anticipates potential modifications to its business practices including recalls or shutdowns, and tests its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances could indicate reduced fair value. AbbVie also maintains substantial liquidity through operating cash flows, a revolving credit facility, access to capital markets and strategic financing arrangements, while managing debt maturities, interest rate risk and contingent consideration liabilities to preserve its financial flexibility and operational continuity.

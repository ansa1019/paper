In the risk factors section, we acknowledge that natural disasters, including climate change, and other catastrophic events beyond our control could impede our ability to deliver services, diminish demand, and impose significant expenditures despite maintaining crisis management and disaster response plans. We describe our strategic allocation of significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures and a data governance framework designed to protect against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, while recognizing that residual risks may remain and that unauthorized access could cause operational disruptions. We also detail our distributed infrastructure and digital operations strategy—utilizing co-located and public cloud data centers across multiple jurisdictions and leveraging machine learning and AI—that not only optimizes performance but enhances business continuity by enabling workflow integration across siloed organizations. In our overview, we explicitly state that the transformation to digital operations enabled by the Now Platform increases our customers’ resiliency and security, improving productivity and experiences under challenging conditions. Additionally, we note that our incident response and recovery capabilities are supported by disaster response planning, scalable infrastructure, and ongoing investments in capacity to absorb strains from internal or external disturbances such as power shortages, telecommunications failures, and geopolitical instability.

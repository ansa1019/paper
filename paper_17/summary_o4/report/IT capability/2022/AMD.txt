AMD’s 2022 Annual Report discloses a range of practices and structures designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under adverse conditions, consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company mitigates supply‐chain and operational risks by diversifying production across multiple third-party wafer foundries and ATMP joint ventures, maintaining long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements for critical equipment, materials and substrates, and retaining full flexibility to contract with alternative suppliers. Inventory and pricing risks are managed through contractual rights of return, rebates, price-protection provisions and distributor price incentives, while foreign-currency exposures are hedged to preserve cash flow integrity. AMD enhances its liquidity resilience by issuing senior notes, establishing a five-year revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program, and maintaining sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements. The company continuously monitors and updates its internal business processes and information systems—including a major ERP upgrade—and invests in cybersecurity measures and business continuity plans to guard against IT outages, data breaches and evolving threats. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AMD adjusted supply-chain requirements, product schedules and remote-working practices to address facility closures, border restrictions, logistics delays and workforce mobility constraints, thereby sustaining operational continuity. Strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando are integrated to broaden technological capabilities and market diversification, while ongoing R&D investments, risk assessment procedures and regulatory compliance initiatives support adaptation to macroeconomic, competitive, legal and environmental perturbations. These interconnected strategies demonstrate AMD’s systemic perspective on risk mitigation, operational flexibility and resource allocation to sustain performance and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

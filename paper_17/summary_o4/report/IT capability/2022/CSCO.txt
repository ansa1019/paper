In response to the economic and financial disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures, we continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply chain costs; to mitigate these constraints, we have partnered with key suppliers to leverage our volume purchasing and extend supply coverage, revised supplier arrangements, entered into agreements with contract manufacturers that allow them to procure inventory based on our defined criteria, and increased efforts in procuring components to meet customer expectations, which has in turn increased our inventories, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments. Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations recur we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, adversely affecting our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liabilities for purchase commitments in light of rapidly changing technology, customer requirements, and environmental perturbations. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, including component shortages and evolving customer needs, we initiated a restructuring plan—including a voluntary early retirement program—which we completed in fiscal 2022, and continue to strategically realign resources and investments in key priority areas of engineering, sales, service, and marketing to drive profitable growth over the long term. Amendments to supplier agreements, discretionary shifts in resource deployment, and acquisitions of companies and technologies serve as strategic initiatives that reflect our resilience strategy to absorb strain, preserve functioning, and maintain operational continuity under challenging conditions. Furthermore, we maintain a diversified financing portfolio, including a $10.0 billion commercial paper program and a $3.0 billion committed credit facility, to ensure adequate liquidity and flexibility to execute strategic plans, manage unexpected situations, and support ongoing operations across hierarchical levels and geographic regions.

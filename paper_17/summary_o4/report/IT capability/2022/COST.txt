We have made and may continue to make investments and acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels, acknowledging that the effectiveness of these investments can be less predictable than opening new locations and might not provide the anticipated benefits or desired returns; we emphasize our dependence on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots, and disclose that disruptions due to fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemics or other extreme weather conditions or catastrophic events, labor issues or shipping problems may result in delays in production and delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, thereby adversely affecting sales and member satisfaction; given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important that we build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, internal or external security breaches, errors by employees and catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and we are currently making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing our digital resiliency, recognizing that failure or delay in these projects could be costly and harmful to our business; we further disclose that natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies and other catastrophic events could result in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, temporary closures of facilities, workforce shortages, IT systems disruptions, interruptions in the supply of products, transportation delays and reductions in product availability, which may compel us to suspend operations in some or all of our locations with material adverse effects; we acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects, including demand volatility, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, labor availability, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance and exposure to litigation, with impacts that are highly unpredictable and volatile; in our management’s discussion and analysis we state that while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe we have been successful historically in adapting our business to such changes through adjustments to pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of private-label items and expanding online offerings, and that our philosophy of maintaining a perception of pricing authority supports resilience by ensuring the availability of the right merchandise at competitive prices; additionally, we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes and believe our cash and investment positions and operating cash flows, together with capacity under existing and available credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements; and we manage risks associated with employee health-care, workers’ compensation, general liability, property damage and other exposures primarily through self-insurance, estimating liabilities using historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions while acknowledging that actual claims and costs could differ significantly.

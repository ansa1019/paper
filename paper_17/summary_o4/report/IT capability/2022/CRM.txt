The Company’s risk management and operational framework encompasses the maintenance and improvement of business and data governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, including the ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks, with regular briefings to its Board, Cybersecurity and Privacy Committee and executive management, all intended to preserve or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances. It recognizes that breaches or disruptions—whether through cyberattacks, defects in complex hardware and software integrations, third-party service interruptions, supply chain constraints or natural disasters—may impair delivery of services, diminish demand, harm reputation and require substantial remediation costs. Accordingly, the Company has implemented disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements for its data centers and alternate facilities, makes significant investments in scaling its personnel, infrastructure and human capital software to manage unexpected growth and changes, and continually improves its capacity planning to mitigate performance degradation and service outages. Periodic organizational changes, including realignment of its sales force and office‐space reductions, are managed to balance scalability with productivity, while acquisitions are subject to rigorous integration processes to avoid disruptions and resource overextension. The Company further monitors and adapts its policies and practices in response to evolving global economic conditions, public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical events, climate-related risks including wildfires, floods and seismic threats near its headquarters, and emerging legal and regulatory requirements, acknowledging that failure to anticipate, prepare for or respond effectively to these pressures could adversely affect its ability to maintain integrity and performance during challenging circumstances.

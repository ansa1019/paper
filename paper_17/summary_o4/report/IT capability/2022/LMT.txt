The company describes a multifaceted approach to preserving positive adjustment under challenging conditions by seeking to identify, manage and mitigate risks associated with reliance on government appropriations and budget uncertainty, sustaining operational continuity through a diverse range of products and services to reduce dependence on any single contract, long-term supply agreements, alternative sourcing of critical materials and accelerated payments to at-risk suppliers. It invests in digital transformation and emerging technologies, forges strategic partnerships, joint ventures and equity investments to access external knowledge and capabilities, and maintains rigorous enterprise risk management, counterintelligence and cybersecurity programs to foresee, confront and recover from external disturbances. The firm also adapts its workforce model with hybrid work arrangements, leadership development, succession planning and knowledge transfer processes to bolster organizational health, agility and performance under pressure. Financially, it manages liquidity and capital structure through prudent debt issuance, revolving credit facilities and share repurchase and dividend programs, while employing pension risk transfer transactions to stabilize postretirement obligations. Collectively, these strategies and mechanisms enable the organization to absorb strain, maintain system integrity and performance, and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

In its 2022 Form 10-K Stryker discloses a range of practices and contingencies that reflect its capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance under adverse conditions, including diversified sourcing strategies and pre-buying of critical raw materials to counter global supply chain shortages and inflationary pressures; the use of contingencies such as alternative suppliers, business continuity plans and insurance programs to manage manufacturing interruptions from natural disasters, pandemics and cybersecurity incidents; investments in preventative measures, incident response protocols, employee training and system monitoring to preserve IT infrastructure integrity and avert cyber-related operational disruptions; deployment of a global enterprise resource planning system with design and implementation safeguards to ensure the continuity of order processing, shipping, invoicing and customer support; dynamic reallocation of production capacity and workforce in response to fluctuating demand during the COVID-19 pandemic and unexpected elective procedure suspensions; ongoing assessment and adaptation to regulatory and pricing pressures—such as EU Medical Device Regulation implementation and China’s volume-based procurement and import purchase evaluation programs—through portfolio realignment, strategic divestitures and targeted investments; continuous monitoring of geopolitical and macroeconomic risks, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, weakening exchange rates, tariffs, labor shortages and transportation bottlenecks, to guide resource deployment and safeguard critical operations; disciplined integration of acquisitions and divestitures with structured milestone assessments and headcount controls to capture synergies, maintain innovation pipelines and prevent organizational brittleness; use of financial instruments and derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposures; and a corporate responsibility framework addressing ESG, sustainability and climate change risks to protect supply chains, facilities and stakeholder interests, all of which together demonstrate Stryker’s ability to foresee, confront and adapt to sudden disruptive changes in order to sustain and enhance its performance.

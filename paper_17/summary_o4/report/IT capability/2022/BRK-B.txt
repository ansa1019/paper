Berkshire and its subsidiaries, relying extensively on technology in virtually all aspects of business, have experienced cyber security risks and have undertaken measures including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate potential service interruptions, safety failures and other operational difficulties. The Board monitors succession risk with a formal succession plan for key management, complemented by outstanding managers in the company’s highly diversified operating units, to preserve operational continuity under challenging conditions. Our decentralized business model requires qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities and to respond to changing business and regulatory environments, and the inability to recruit, train and retain personnel could impair operating results, financial condition and liquidity. While general business risks such as pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, terrorism, extreme weather events, cyber-attacks and supply chain disruptions have produced significant supply chain interruptions and higher operating costs, we maintain a very strong capital base and redundant liquidity, including substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and Treasury bills, and insist on safety over yield with a minimum liquidity threshold of $30 billion, thereby enhancing our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite internal or external pressures. Our insurance operations employ disciplined underwriting practices designed to mitigate potential losses, limit aggregation of catastrophe exposures, regularly assess loss estimates and maintain ample insurance float; our railroad and utilities and energy businesses plan multiyear capital expenditures to maintain system reliability and safety; and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers prioritize financial strength and ample reserves, generating net operating cash flows between $37 billion and $40 billion annually to ensure liquidity and flexibility. Recognizing the unpredictability of future economic effects and the volatility of market and regulatory environments, we maintain robust risk management frameworks, diversified capital allocation processes and a strong balance sheet to respond effectively to disruptive events, reconfigure trajectories toward the future and emerge capable of preserving or improving performance under adverse conditions.

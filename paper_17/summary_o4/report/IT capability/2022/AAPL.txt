The company’s operations depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse macroeconomic or public health events can materially disrupt demand, supply chains and financial markets, requiring continuous monitoring and adaptive measures such as changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and adjusting production and distribution to preserve or improve functioning under strain. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with relevant authorities’ recommendations, including restrictions on travel, temporary closures and quarantine measures, and adapts its logistical and manufacturing operations to address component shortages and channel interruptions. Recognizing the risks of single-source or limited-source procurement, the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment and entered long-term supply agreements, built inventory in advance of product launches, and made prepayments to suppliers to absorb strain and maintain business continuity, while acknowledging that such arrangements may entail recoverability risks if partners face financial distress or operational failures. In addition to insurance coverage for certain losses, the company devotes substantial resources to network and data security by implementing systems and processes—including encryption, multifactor authentication, continuous monitoring and disaster-recovery planning—to mitigate the impact of cybersecurity incidents and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data; however, it recognizes that system redundancy and continuity measures may be inadequate for all eventualities. Financial resilience is supported by maintaining cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, accessing debt markets and employing derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuations, thereby allocating financial resources strategically to sustain liquidity and performance under pressure. The company’s contractual obligations—such as noncancelable manufacturing purchase commitments, lease payment obligations for facilities, and commercial paper and fixed-rate debt maturities—are managed alongside its capital return program to ensure operational flexibility, resource deployment and recovery capabilities in response to unexpected events, supply shortages, environmental disruptions and other adverse conditions.

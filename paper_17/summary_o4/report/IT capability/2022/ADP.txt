ADP’s disclosures describe an array of disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect its businesses against a multitude of events—including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions and power or communication failures—and acknowledge that despite these preparations such plans may not prevent or mitigate loss of client data or funds, service interruptions, operational disruptions or facility damage. The company states it has programs and processes in place to prevent, detect and respond to data or cybersecurity incidents, devoting significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes, to invest in and enhance its information security controls, and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities, with none of the cyber incidents to date materially impacting its operations. It continuously upgrades, enhances and expands its technology, solutions and services, while undertaking company-wide transformation initiatives designed to streamline its organization, extend distribution, strengthen talent and culture, and support revenue growth, margin improvement and productivity. ADP reports that it generates sufficient free cash flow to satisfy its cash dividends and modest debt obligations, enabling it to absorb downturns and remain steadfast in reinvestments, its long-term strategy and shareholder-friendly actions, and that its financial condition remains solid, positioning it to support associates and clients through dynamic and challenging environments such as global recessions, geopolitical conflicts and public health emergencies.

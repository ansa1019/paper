During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities on a timely basis, and we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment to avoid lacking the infrastructure and resources to scale effectively or expanding capacity beyond appropriate levels. The COVID-19 pandemic and related quarantines, facility closures, workforce challenges, travel restrictions, and social distancing measures have disrupted production, sourcing, logistics, business travel, on-site staffing, and capital expansion projects, requiring modifications to our business processes, implementation of business continuity plans, development and qualification of alternative sources of supply, and widespread teleworking arrangements. Disruptions to our supply chain and outsource providers—whether due to financial setbacks, exclusivity arrangements, force majeure events, transportation interruptions, volatility in component availability and cost, or reliance on single or limited-source suppliers—could impair our ability to forecast demand, ship products, perform services, recognize revenue, and meet customer expectations, prompting us, where practical, to establish alternative sources to mitigate supplier concentration risk. We manage our expense levels based in part on anticipated future revenues and, where appropriate, respond to fluctuations with cost-management programs aimed at aligning expenditures with revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Although we maintain business continuity plans, our manufacturing and R&D facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations and are subject to disruption from natural or man-made disasters, widespread illness, or other events beyond our control, which could delay product development, shipping, and customer support and erode customer trust. Our business also depends on the resilience of critical information systems and the protection of technology, data, intellectual property, and other sensitive information, yet cybersecurity incidents, breaches, or failures of security procedures may disrupt our operations, compromise confidential information, or impair our ability to meet regulatory obligations. During fiscal year 2022, solid customer demand was tempered by ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary cost pressures that impacted our ability to fulfill demand and compressed gross margins, trends we expect to persist in the near term and that may continue to negatively affect our revenue and profitability. To preserve organizational flexibility and support long-term growth, we believe maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is essential to sustain investment in R&D and capital infrastructure, and we expect that anticipated operating cash flows, together with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, will be sufficient to fund operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends for at least the next twelve months.

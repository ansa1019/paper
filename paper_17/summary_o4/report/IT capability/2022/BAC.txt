The Corporation discloses that it has established comprehensive business continuity and operational resilience frameworks designed to maintain critical functions and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including policies, standards and procedures for contingency planning, crisis response, backup systems, and recovery in the event of natural disasters, pandemics, cyberattacks, third-party or infrastructure failures and other internal or external disruptions. It conducts enterprise-wide stress testing, scenario analysis and capital contingency planning to assess liquidity, funding and capital buffers under adverse macroeconomic, market and operational stress events, and it maintains resolution planning, including a preferred single-point-of-entry strategy with pre-positioned intercompany liquidity and capital arrangements, to preserve continuity of operations across legal entities. Governance bodies including the board, enterprise and management risk committees oversee the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of risk and validate the effectiveness of resilience measures through independent audit and compliance reviews. The Corporation also continuously refines its incident response capabilities, third-party risk management, cybersecurity defenses and technology redundancies, and uses hedging, model validation and protocol adjustments to adapt its operational and financial positions, thereby preserving organizational integrity, flexibility and performance maintenance when confronted with environmental perturbations or exceptional conditions.

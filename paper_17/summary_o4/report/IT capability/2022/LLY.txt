The annual report discloses that the Company recognizes the potential for its business, financial condition and operations to be “materially adversely affected” by a multitude of known and unknown internal and external pressures and has accordingly instituted risk‐mitigation and resource‐allocation processes to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions.  It manages research and development spending across a diversified pipeline so that delays or terminations of any single project need not materially alter total investment levels, and it pursues a variety of business development activities—licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, joint ventures, acquisitions and equity investments—to reconstitute trajectories of response to disruptive events and to generate innovation and systemic adaptability.  In response to supply disruptions and fluctuating demand for incretin products, the Company has implemented operational continuity measures, including interim patient‐support actions and phased capacity expansions involving internal and contract manufacturing sites worldwide, supported by multi-billion-dollar capital commitments over several years.  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, it redirected resources to develop and supply therapies, safeguarded employee health and community needs, and adapted its reimbursement and pricing policies amid evolving government programs, demonstrating organizational flexibility in the face of extreme conditions.  Its financial resilience is underpinned by maintaining substantial liquidity—including cash, investments and committed credit facilities—along with interest-rate and foreign-exchange hedging programs to limit volatility, and by proactive planning for legislative and regulatory changes (such as the Inflation Reduction Act and tax capitalization requirements) that affect pricing, reimbursement and cash‐flow timing.  The Company’s processes for impairment testing of indefin ite-lived and long-lived assets, combined with contingent milestone and royalty payment structures in acquired intellectual property, permit dynamic reconfiguration of its asset base as project risks and regulatory landscapes shift.  Collectively, these strategies and mechanisms reflect a systemic perspective on sustaining integrity, adaptability and performance continuity under nominal, extreme and exceptional disturbances, in keeping with scholarly definitions of organizational resilience as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

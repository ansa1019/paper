The report describes a range of organizational practices and capabilities that support the company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions: its opportunistic buying strategy and lean inventory levels require merchants to “effectively react to rapidly changing opportunities and trends in the market,” assess the desirability and value of merchandise, and source the right products “at the right times, in the right quantities, at the right prices, and in the right mix,” while flexible allocation of floor space and ongoing adjustments to sales forecasts and markdowns enable rapid reconfiguration of inventory to meet unexpected customer demand or guard against excess stock. The company’s ability to allocate, deliver, and maintain its preferred mix and level of inventory has been tested by global supply chain disruptions—“including an increase in competition for limited shipping capacity”—and by COVID-19–related store closures, during which new procedures such as enhanced cleaning protocols, occupancy limitations and health and safety measures were implemented to maintain continuity. Its flexible off-price model “allows us greater flexibility to meet consumer product preferences and trends than many traditional retailers (for example, by expanding and contracting merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes),” reflecting systemic adaptability and partial maintenance of performance amid environmental perturbations. Investments in information technology systems—including planning, supply chain management, e-commerce, and “effective disaster recovery plans”—and data security initiatives serve as resilience strategies against cyber- or system-related disruptions, while hedging of fuel and inventory-related currency exposures exemplifies risk mitigation tools. Growth and expansion efforts—into new geographies, channels, product lines and through acquisitions or divestitures—depend on coordinated information sharing, development of new capabilities, and seamless integration of third-party providers to manage increased complexity and prevent brittleness. Marketing adaptability across traditional and digital/social media channels, coupled with forecasting processes to align sales and expenses, further sustains positive adjustment under pressures. Finally, managing a large, geographically dispersed workforce through recruitment, training and remote-work arrangements, overseeing extensive real-estate leases, and navigating evolving regulatory environments illustrate the company’s capacity to absorb internal and external variations and preserve its integrity and performance.

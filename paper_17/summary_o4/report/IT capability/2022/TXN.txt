TI’s disclosures reflect a multifaceted approach to maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by deploying resources strategically, strengthening its competitive advantages and managing operational continuity in the face of internal and external pressures. The company acknowledges susceptibility to macroeconomic weakness, geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, epidemics, security risks and currency fluctuations and describes risk mitigation through diversification of operations in more than thirty countries, dynamic inventory and production forecasting, disciplined capital allocation and substantial investments in manufacturing capacity—including the addition of a 300-mm semiconductor factory—to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. Cybersecurity threats and complex regulatory requirements are addressed through ongoing enhancements to information‐technology defenses and compliance frameworks, while reliance on third‐party suppliers is balanced by continuous monitoring of supply chain risks, scenario‐based inventory allowances and contingency planning. TI undertakes strategic, business and organizational changes—acquisitions, divestitures, capital investments and restructuring actions—to reconfigure trajectories toward long‐term growth, adapt its product mix to shifting customer demand and leverage government incentives under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. The company’s emphasis on analog and embedded processing, combined with disciplined R&D spending and efficiency initiatives, underscores its dynamic capabilities to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures, allocate capital to the best opportunities and sustain free cash flow generation. Risk assessment processes cover natural events, product liability, tax uncertainties and financial market instability, with management forecasting working capital needs, maintaining liquidity and applying proactive measures to ensure performance maintenance and resilience under nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

Our risk disclosure notes that our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant, necessitating maintenance of performance under unexpected situations and preservation of functioning despite uncertainty. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services to ensure business continuity and mitigate supply constraints, and we strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node, selectively reducing facility utilization to address elevated inventory levels. Our network of geographically dispersed manufacturing facilities and subcontractors continuously implements new product and process technology at each site, enabling operational flexibility and adaptation to natural disasters, geopolitical risks, or public health crises. We invest in research and development for new and existing products and process technologies, such as EUV lithography, to respond to environmental disruptions and transform our capabilities. We maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities and cybersecurity infrastructure, including the processing, storage, and transmission of sensitive data, and mitigate credit risk by investing through high-credit-quality financial institutions with limited exposure to any single obligor. We are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations, expect our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing to meet our requirements through the next 12 months and beyond, and maintain board-authorized discretionary share repurchase and dividend programs to support financial stability. We also pursue government incentives and grants contingent upon achieving performance obligations and regularly review contractual commitments with our third-party suppliers to sustain our resilience strategies, risk mitigation efforts, and operational continuity.

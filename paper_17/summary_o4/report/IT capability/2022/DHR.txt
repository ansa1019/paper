The annual report highlights a broad array of measures and organizational characteristics that together support the company’s capacity to absorb strain, adapt to internal and external pressures and maintain operations under challenging conditions. The Company emphasizes the maintenance of business continuity amid “major health concerns including pandemics, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions,” pointing to its global operations and diverse product lines as organizational “buffers” that limit the impact of any single industry or economy on overall firm performance. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, management redeployed capabilities, expertise and scale to develop diagnostic tests and support vaccine and therapeutic production, while flexibly adjusting manufacturing and supply-chain configurations, reallocating resources to critical health needs, and maintaining system redundancy and disaster-recovery planning for its information technology networks. Ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, strategic investments in new product development and expansion of manufacturing capacity—often supported by government financing with built-in allocation rights—demonstrate proactive resource deployment and risk mitigation. The Company’s financial resilience is underpinned by disciplined liquidity management, including robust operating cash flows, access to commercial paper and committed credit facilities, cross-currency hedges to protect net investments and proactive refinancing of debt, all of which ensure operational flexibility and support strategic initiatives. Additionally, systematic monitoring of economic, geopolitical, regulatory and competitive factors, combined with diversified geographic and industry exposure, structured governance of litigation and contingent liabilities, and ongoing environmental, health and safety compliance programs, collectively fortify the organization’s ability to partially preserve integrity and performance in the face of unexpected situations, external disturbances and evolving market conditions.

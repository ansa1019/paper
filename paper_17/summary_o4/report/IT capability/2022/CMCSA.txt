The company acknowledges that its businesses operate in highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing industries, requiring positive adjustment under challenging conditions and continual adaptation of video service offerings, broadband enhancements and new programming such as Peacock to confront shifts in consumer behavior and emerging competitors. Federal and state broadband-deployment funding initiatives and evolving telecommunications regulations may impose constraints on business continuity planning and resource allocation, while consolidation among content suppliers and distributors underscores the need for inter-organizational collaboration and strategic agility to maintain performance and competitive advantage. The company depends on third-party vendors for critical hardware, software and operational support, monitors vendor operations and financial condition to mitigate supply-chain disruptions and reconfigure service delivery, and continues to invest in scalable infrastructure, network capacity expansion and multigigabit speed upgrades leveraging DOCSIS 4.0 technology. To sustain system resilience and preserve organizational health, the company rigorously protects and manages intellectual property rights, maintains extensive security programs and constantly updates defenses across its network and information systems to detect and thwart sophisticated cyber threats, safeguard confidential and personal data and ensure operational flexibility. Natural disasters, severe weather events, infectious disease outbreaks and other uncontrollable events, including COVID-19, have in the past caused network degradation, service outages and theme-park disruptions, prompting capital investments and contingency measures to reconstitute operations, manage hazards and recover performance, and the company expects to continue experiencing such extreme events and allocates resources for emergency management and system integrity. Liquidity and financial flexibility are preserved through substantial availability under a revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, disciplined capital expenditures focused on strategic initiatives, and share repurchase and dividend programs, thereby supporting the organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning under adversity.

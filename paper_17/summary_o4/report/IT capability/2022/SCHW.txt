Schwabâ€™s Form 10-K discloses an enterprise risk management framework that seeks to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by identifying, assessing, measuring, and responding to operational, compliance, credit, market and liquidity risks within board-approved risk appetite limits. Under this framework, senior management and risk committees oversee the development and enforcement of policies, limits, and contingency plans designed to preserve business continuity and performance despite internal or external disturbances. Schwab maintains a geographically dispersed backup and recovery infrastructure, routine business continuity and disaster-recovery testing, and an incident-management program to address technology failures, security breaches, natural disasters or other disruptions. Cybersecurity, fraud, anti-money laundering, conduct and fiduciary risks are managed through policies, controls, training, monitoring and vendor oversight, while model risk is governed by standardized lifecycles and centralized registration. Credit risk in investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin loans, derivatives and securities financing is controlled through underwriting standards, collateral requirements, and regular portfolio reviews. Market risk is limited through interest-rate sensitivity limits, net interest revenue and economic-value-of-equity simulations, and derivative hedging strategies. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining high-quality liquid assets, diversified funding sources including credit facilities and commercial paper programs, daily stress tests and capital contingency plans, ensuring the company can absorb strain, reconstitute operations and adapt to evolving market, regulatory or client-driven pressures.

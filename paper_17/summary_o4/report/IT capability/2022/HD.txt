The company discloses that its business, results of operations and financial condition depend on its ability to absorb internal and external variations and disturbances—ranging from intense competition, shifting customer preferences and macroeconomic volatility to supply chain disruptions, extreme weather events, cyber threats and public health crises—and that failure to anticipate, adapt, reconfigure or recover from such disruptions could materially impair operational continuity, customer experience, delivery performance, market share, brand reputation and financial performance. It emphasizes that its interconnected retail strategy relies on strategic investments in supply chain expansion, distribution facilities, store and digital platform enhancements, information technology systems and associate capabilities to streamline operations, maintain flexibility and preserve or improve functioning under adversity. The company further notes that the coordinated planning, resource allocation and execution of new processes, systems, technologies, alliances and fulfillment options are fundamental to risk mitigation and business continuity, and that any inability to manage the volume, timing, nature, location or cost of these strategic initiatives—or to effectively respond to unexpected events—could disrupt operations, increase costs, diminish competitive advantage and undermine its ability to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

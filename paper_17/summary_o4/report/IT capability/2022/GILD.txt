We face risks related to our supply and distribution of Veklury, which, given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the difficulty in accurately forecasting demand, may lead to product shortages or excess inventory requiring write-offs, underscoring the need for robust demand-planning and manufacturing flexibility. Our reliance on third-party sites for the logistical collection and delivery of Yescarta and Tecartus likewise exposes us to potential disruptions or delays that could result in product loss, regulatory action or constrained commercialization, and our new automated CAR T-cell and retroviral vector manufacturing facilities may require additional time and resources to ramp up capacity. We may also be unable to obtain materials or supplies necessary for clinical trials or commercial manufacture, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of new suppliers is required or if our single-source suppliers face interruptions, whether due to equipment failures, natural disasters or other events, which could impair our ability to generate adequate supply. Manufacturing issues, including adverse developments at our own or third-party facilities, may cause shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures or product withdrawals, potentially damaging our reputation and disrupting both commercial supply and clinical development. Actual or threatened outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may significantly disrupt our global operations through supply chain and logistics constraints, workforce safety challenges and reduced patient access, while cybersecurity incidents or breaches—whether targeting our systems or those of our business and technology partners—could compromise critical data, interrupt operations and expose us to legal liability and reputational harm. Our ability to withstand competitive pressures and maintain business continuity depends on our capacity to adapt manufacturing processes, reconfigure supply chains, allocate resources effectively, manage external scrutiny and rapidly respond to both expected and unexpected disruptions, thereby preserving operational flexibility, organizational health and long-term performance.

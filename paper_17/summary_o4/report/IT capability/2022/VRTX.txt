The annual report highlights the company’s dependence on third-party manufacturers and internal capabilities to produce its products and clinical trial materials, noting that it “may not be able to maintain our third-party relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control” and that “global supply chain disruptions” and the need for “investments in systems, equipment, facilities, and expertise to develop and maintain” complex manufacturing processes for cell and genetic therapies pose ongoing operational challenges. It describes its adoption of “a business continuity plan” and warns that “if our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed,” while pandemic-related disruptions have led to “delays in enrollment in certain clinical trials, supply chain delays, and regulatory delays due to COVID-19,” straining capacity at clinical sites and healthcare systems. The report also identifies risks from “cyber-attacks,” cautioning that a “disruption, infiltration, or failure of our information technology systems” could result in “breaches of data security and loss of critical data” and materially harm the business, and details evolving privacy and security regulations that require ongoing investment in compliance and legal resources. Its risk factors emphasize external pressures including intense competition, pricing and reimbursement challenges driven by government and third-party payors under laws such as the Inflation Reduction Act, and concentration in a small number of specialty distributors, all of which may adversely affect revenues and liquidity. To preserve performance under these challenging conditions, the company notes its use of foreign currency forward contracts, maintenance of working capital, access to a revolving credit facility, and the need to “enhance our operational and financial infrastructure,” “cross-functional decision-making processes,” and “budget prioritization systems” to support strategic initiatives, reconfigure resources, and sustain operations in the face of disruption.

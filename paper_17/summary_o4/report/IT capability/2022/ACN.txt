Accenture’s risk disclosures underscore an implicit focus on organizational resilience by detailing how volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions can “undermine business confidence in our significant markets,” disrupt client demand, complicate forecasting and require the adaptation and expansion of services and solutions in response to ongoing technological change. The company “proactively plan[s] and manage[s] the size and composition of our workforce” to align with current and projected demand, including hiring or reskilling, adjusting compensation, rebalancing the workforce through involuntary terminations or redeployments and continuously innovating to preserve operational flexibility and institutionalize critical knowledge. Its dependence on complex information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store data and to communicate globally means that “security incidents and cyberattacks” or “extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network or cloud services” could “adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients,” reinforcing the need for robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Accenture’s growth strategy of responding to rapid industry developments by driving innovation in digital, cloud, security, automation and artificial intelligence solutions further supports its ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under pressure, while its practices for acquiring, integrating or divesting businesses and managing legal, regulatory and contractual risks across more than 200 cities in 49 countries reflect a systemic perspective on maintaining integrity, reconfiguring resources and safeguarding continuity amid internal and external variations and disturbances.

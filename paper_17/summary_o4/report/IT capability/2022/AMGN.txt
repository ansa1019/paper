Amgen’s disclosures underscore its organizational resilience in maintaining business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions, highlighting the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trials, operations, manufacturing, supply chains, distribution systems, product development and commercial performance and the company’s response through remote working arrangements without significant operational interruption and continued monitoring and management of supply reliability. The firm’s risk assessment processes address internal and external variations by investing in the monitoring, protection and resilience of its critical and sensitive data and systems, including managing vulnerabilities and emergency patches in sophisticated IT infrastructures and deploying backup generators and comprehensive business continuity plans in its principal Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks manufacturing facilities to absorb strain from hurricanes, earthquakes, power outages and labor disruptions. Amgen emphasizes operational flexibility and resource allocation by relying on multiple production sites, third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers, hedging financial exposures through interest rate and cross-currency swaps, maintaining credit facilities and commercial paper programs for liquidity, and assessing environmental, social and governance objectives to foster long-term sustainability. The company conducts periodic assessments of regulatory, cyber and climate risks, holds extensive financing arrangements to ensure uninterrupted funding, and maintains processes for rapid corrective actions, contingency planning and risk mitigation to preserve integrity, performance maintenance and adaptability against diverse pressures, constraints and unexpected situations.

Abbott’s operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain, which has been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures, and availability issues for services, raw materials, and supplies, though to date Abbott has been able to offset some of these pressures and manage various supply chain challenges without significant disruption. Abbott invests in its information technology systems and data protection, monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities, and aligns its global operations with evolving governmental orders and guidelines while taking aggressive steps to limit COVID-19 exposure and enhance employee safety. The company commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development to launch new products and technologies under uncertain regulatory environments and market acceptance, mobilizing teams to develop and launch various COVID-19 diagnostic tests pursuant to emergency use authorizations. In response to operational and market shifts, Abbott approved restructuring plans to streamline manufacturing and organizational processes across its medical devices, nutritional, diagnostic, and established pharmaceutical businesses, recording employee-related severance and other charges, inventory-related charges, and fixed asset impairments to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, and subsequently realized recoveries by selling previously impaired inventory when demand rebounded. Abbott’s financial resilience is supported by strong operating cash flows that are expected to continue to exceed capital expenditures and dividends, substantial cash and short-term investment balances, access to committed credit facilities and capital markets to maintain investment-grade ratings, and active management of working capital, customer credit risk, and purchase commitments. These combined actions enable Abbott to absorb strain, preserve functionality, and adapt its organizational trajectories under internal and external disturbances, reflecting the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

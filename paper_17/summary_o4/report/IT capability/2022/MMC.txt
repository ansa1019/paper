The Company’s disclosures emphasize its focus on maintaining operational continuity and adapting under adverse conditions by regularly assessing and enhancing its business continuity, disaster recovery and data recovery plans and key management succession procedures.  It acknowledges that its ability to function during and after disruptive events—ranging from natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, floods), pandemics and geopolitical crises to cyberattacks, power or telecommunications failures and security breaches—depends on the ongoing availability of personnel, facilities and the proper functioning of computer, telecommunications and related systems, and that failure to recover could result in material financial loss, reputational harm, regulatory sanctions or legal liability.  The Company invests in technology systems and infrastructure to support its core processes in a cost- and resource-efficient manner, while managing third-party vendor and supply-chain dependencies, and it continuously monitors and responds to evolving regulatory, privacy, data security and hybrid-work challenges, recognizing that its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve its performance under pressure is central to its competitive advantage and long-term resilience.

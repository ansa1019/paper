In its annual report, management identifies a range of risks and uncertainties—such as the COVID-19 pandemic’s curtailment of business activities, significant supply-chain disruptions, economic uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets—and acknowledges that the future impact on operations and financial condition depends on evolving factors and “to which we may not be able to effectively respond.” The firm discloses potential reductions in operating effectiveness due to remote work or hybrid arrangements, personnel unavailability, delays or cancellations of capital projects, and further supply-chain disruptions, and the need to adjust its business model to mitigate adverse developments in general economic conditions it cannot control. It underscores the importance of attracting, engaging, developing and retaining a large and diverse global workforce, negotiating collective bargaining agreements and preparing for strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns that could interrupt service continuity. The company reports investments and ongoing commitments in network optimization, facility automation, digital transformation and IT security initiatives—including disaster recovery plans and IT risk management—to safeguard against cyber-attacks, data breaches, system disruptions and evolving security requirements, noting that any such event could cause material outages or interruptions in business. Climate-related risks, severe weather and natural or man-made disasters—including those exacerbated by global climate change—are identified as challenges to its integrated air and ground network, with the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 contingent on technological advancements outside its control. To manage financial volatility, the company applies fuel surcharges based on market indices and employs hedging transactions to offset fuel price fluctuations, monitors and manages foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures with derivative instruments, and maintains cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and access to commercial paper programs and credit facilities to fund operations, planned investments and shareholder returns. Strategic initiatives under its “customer first, people led, innovation driven” framework—including acquisitions of digital platforms and healthcare logistics specialists—are presented as means to enhance revenue quality, operational flexibility, capital structure and service continuity in the face of external pressures, disruptions and competitive challenges.

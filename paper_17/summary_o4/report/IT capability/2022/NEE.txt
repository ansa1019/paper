NEE and FPL have established a comprehensive framework of operational and financial measures designed to preserve system integrity and maintain performance under adverse conditions, including the accumulation of storm reserves for restoration costs and nuclear decommissioning funds, the winterizing of critical equipment, the modification or alternation of plant operations and the expansion of load-shedding options to address hurricanes, flooding, extreme temperatures and icing events, with recoverable costs subject to regulatory approval; a rigorous risk-management regime that employs over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative instruments, daily value-at-risk limits, internal controls and master netting agreements to mitigate fuel, energy, interest rate and foreign currency price volatility and counterparty credit exposure; the use of letters of credit, surety bonds, collateral arrangements and corporate guarantees to secure performance obligations under power purchase agreements, pipeline projects, major equipment contracts and corporate credit facilities; ongoing monitoring and mitigation of operational risks—from equipment defects and compliance failures to cyber-security breaches and physical or geopolitical threats—through multi-layered insurance programs, emergency response protocols and supply-chain contingency planning; structured liquidity and capital arrangements, including syndicated and bilateral revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs and targeted dividend and reserve amortization mechanisms, to ensure ready access to financial resources and maintain targeted regulatory returns; and systematic information technology governance and system-upgrade processes to safeguard critical business functions and customer data in the face of disruptions, all reflecting a forward-looking approach to adaptation, recovery and continuity in a dynamic risk environment.

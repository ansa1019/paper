Throughout 2022 and into our 2023 outlook, we have pursued a trajectory of organizational resilience through targeted enhancements to our transportation plan and network operations, continuing to improve our ability to address surges in demand with adequate resources by adding capacity, improving operations at our yards and other facilities, temporarily relocating and hiring additional train, engine and yard employees, and reducing freight car inventory; we continued to refine our proprietary software to evaluate train and route characteristics to enable proactive intervention by our Operating Practices Command Center to prevent derailments, increased replacement of freight car wheels and addressed human factor yard derailments, and adapted safety procedures and policies based on CDC guidelines to respond to evolving public health conditions; our comprehensive safety management system approach utilizes technology, hazard identification and risk assessments, employee engagement, training, quality control, and targeted capital investments to reduce variability in network operations, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings and enhance our safety culture through programs such as Total Safety Culture, Courage to Care, Commit and Peer to Peer; we maintain adequate resources and continually evaluate our financial condition and liquidity, maintaining committed credit facilities, accessing commercial paper and receivables securitization to mitigate funding constraints, and expect to deploy approximately $3.6 billion in 2023 capital investments to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets and modernize our locomotive fleet, driving more volume and improving operational performance; and our Operating Practices Command Center will implement predictive technology to identify causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions, while continued data-driven risk assessment strategies, targeted climate mitigation efforts and cybersecurity measures strengthen our capacity to absorb strain, preserve functioning under adverse weather and cyber disturbances, and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

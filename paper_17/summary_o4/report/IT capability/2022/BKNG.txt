The annual report acknowledges that the company must “absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity,” noting risks from pandemics, extreme weather, natural disasters, wars, regional hostilities and regulatory restrictions that can disrupt travel demand, partner operations and supply chains. It describes its reliance on third-party reservation systems, insurers, payment processors and hosting facilities as subject to potential interruptions from cybersecurity breaches, IT failures, human error or catastrophic events, despite redundant systems and disaster recovery measures, and warns that it does not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to cover all losses. The report highlights that its continuity depends on maintaining relationships with travel service providers and restaurants that are not contractually required to provide specific inventory, making its operating flexibility and resource deployment vulnerable when partners reduce or withdraw participation. It underscores the need to continuously allocate resources to marketing channels, technology development and skilled personnel to keep pace with rapid market and technological changes, and to comply with evolving competition, anti-trust, data privacy, ESG and payment regulations, as failure to innovate or adapt could impair competitive advantage, brand strength and organizational health. It recognizes that fluctuations in cancellation rates, consumer behavior, search and meta-search dynamics, foreign exchange rates and macroeconomic conditions affect marketing efficiency and cash flows, and that strategic foresight, dynamic capabilities, risk assessment, mitigation mechanisms and recovery strategies are essential to maintain system integrity, preserve performance under pressure and emerge stronger from unexpected disturbances.

Throughout our disclosures, we identify a range of strategies, processes and capabilities designed to support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. We acknowledge our dependency on third-party suppliers and the long, sometimes non-cancellable lead times that can require us to pay premiums, provide deposits and manage purchase commitments to preserve or improve functioning amid supply volatility. We describe operational flexibility in modifying business processes, information systems and workforce practices—including ramping onsite services, implementing flexible work arrangements and social distancing measures—in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and possible future lockdowns, as well as our readiness to transition operations out of vulnerable regions in light of new export licensing restrictions and to cease direct sales in jurisdictions affected by geopolitical events. To absorb strain from market disruptions, we invest in research and development, data center infrastructure, AI cloud services, alternative product offerings and strategic acquisitions while managing channel inventory, extended payment terms and multi-year service agreements. We maintain insurance coverage with appropriate deductibles, preserve liquidity through cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and a commercial paper program, and continuously deploy risk mitigation measures for environmental perturbations, cyber-attacks, regulatory changes and climate-related threats. Our ongoing efforts in resource reconfiguration, ERP integration, cybersecurity enhancements and supply chain oversight underscore our commitment to preserving integrity and performance, sustaining competitive advantage and emerging stronger from extreme or exceptional conditions.

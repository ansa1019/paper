The report describes the company’s disaster recovery and business continuity planning “which position us well, but may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities,” reflecting a systemic perspective on maintaining performance under internal or external variations and disturbances, including “extreme weather conditions and natural disasters.” It acknowledges “supply chain issues caused by factors including the covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts” that have disrupted inventory transit times and raw material availability, and details adaptive strategies “to mitigate the impact across our business,” such as “leveraging our operational playbook…including balancing inventory across our geographies, pricing actions and employing a seasonless approach to products.” The company “continues to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and has made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating, financial and tax planning projections,” evidencing future orientation and crisis preparedness. Risks to information technology are highlighted, noting that “any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business,” and the firm “continues to invest in these efforts” to integrate, secure and enhance systems—an illustration of dynamic capabilities and reconfiguration. Data security and privacy threats are described as hazards that “could have a material adverse effect on our business,” requiring robust risk mitigation and resilience strategies. Financial resilience measures include hedging activities “designed to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations,” and the maintenance of “business interruption insurance,” albeit with possible limitations. The report also emphasizes workforce continuity, acknowledging that “competition for employees in our industry is intense,” and that shifts to new work models “may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees,” potentially impairing our organizational response. These disclosures collectively reveal a multifaceted resilience framework—encompassing risk assessment, resource reconfiguration, innovation in operational flexibility and strategic foresight—aimed at preserving or improving functioning when confronting adversity.

The company acknowledges that unfavorable economic, geopolitical and health crises—such as the conflict in Ukraine, civil unrest, pandemics and extreme weather—have disrupted its operations through volatile commodity markets, supply chain interruptions, cyber incidents, labor shortages, input-cost increases, transportation constraints and potential asset impairments, and it notes that its contingency plans, risk assessment procedures and quality management program are designed to mitigate these risks and preserve business continuity and performance. It further recognizes the need for operational agility and adaptation to sudden environmental perturbations, including inflationary pressures, exchange-rate fluctuations, digital transformation, evolving consumer preferences and intensified competition, and embraces strategic resilience through dynamic capabilities, investment in innovation, marketing effectiveness, e-commerce and sustainability initiatives, inter-organizational collaboration with bottling partners and other third parties, and continuous productivity and resource management to maintain functioning under adverse conditions. The company also discloses measures to strengthen its supply chain resilience—by diversifying suppliers where possible, monitoring sole-source dependencies and extending contingency arrangements—and to reinforce system integrity via enhanced internal controls, cybersecurity defenses and digital tools, as well as to foster organizational health and knowledge absorption through talent recruitment, succession planning, culture that supports innovation and inclusion, and flexible work models, which collectively support its ability to absorb strain, reconfigure operations and sustain performance under nominal, extreme or exceptional circumstances.

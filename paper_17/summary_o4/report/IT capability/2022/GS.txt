Goldman Sachs 2022 Form 10-K describes its resilience framework as essential to “absorbing strain and preserving or improving functioning despite adversity,” noting that despite business continuity and resiliency plans and facilities, “business disruptions impacting our offices and employees could lead to … inability to occupy the offices … or work remotely,” impairing liquidity, disrupting operations, damaging reputation and causing losses. A board-approved governance structure, led by the chief risk officer and specialized risk committees—including the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee, the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee and the Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee—oversees an integrated framework of policies, limits and thresholds to identify, measure, monitor and mitigate liquidity, market, credit and operational risks. Treasury manages asset–liability matching, funds transfer pricing and funding strategy within approved appetite, maintaining substantial Global Core Liquid Assets to pre-fund estimated outflows in stressed scenarios and diversified secured and unsecured funding. Contingency funding plans and firmwide stress tests—encompassing daily value-at-risk back-testing, one-year earnings-at-risk, sensitivity analyses and sovereign default scenarios—inform capital and liquidity planning under severe disruptions. Credit risk management applies annual counterparty reviews, internal ratings, collateral, netting and hedging to limit exposures in derivatives, loans and securities financing. Operational resilience relies on a formal control assessment process, incident capture, scenario analyses and recovery strategies to ensure critical functions remain intact, supported by model risk, internal audit and compliance programs that validate valuation and risk models, controls and crisis-response capabilities, thereby reinforcing adaptability, system integrity and organizational continuity under volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous conditions.

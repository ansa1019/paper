The Company identifies information security and operational resilience as a key risk, cautioning that information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt its business, damage its reputation, increase costs and cause losses, given its reliance on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information and technology in its own systems and those of third-party providers. It discloses that interruptions to its transaction-switching systems—whether from technology malfunctions, fire, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence, accidents or other catastrophic events—could reduce its operational resilience, materially impair the perceived reliability of products carrying its brands and adversely affect its overall business and results of operations. The Form 10-K further warns that operating a real-time account-based payments network presents unique risks, where a prolonged service outage could escalate impacts, including potential regulatory intervention, significant reputational risk, loss of business, liability exposure and operational challenges distinct from those on its core global payments network. To address these risks, the Company maintains an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies, while acknowledging that evolving cyber-threats, natural disasters, geopolitical events and other disruptions may exceed its protective measures. It also discloses that, as guarantor of certain customer settlement obligations, it faces credit and liquidity risk should customers fail to fund daily settlement requirements due to technical problems, liquidity shortfalls or insolvency—a risk that, if concentrated or concurrent, could exceed available resources and materially affect results. The Company emphasizes its dependence on existing liquidity, cash flows from operations and available capital, including an $8 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, to fund global operations, capital expenditures, credit and settlement exposures and business continuity needs. Lastly, it notes that working with new customers and end users to expand its multi-rail solutions and integrated products and services can present operational and onboarding challenges, cost overruns, delays, performance problems, licensing or compliance obligations and reputational damage if new products do not perform as intended, any of which could materially and adversely impact its business, results of operations and brand.

The company’s filings acknowledge that its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions depends on a broad array of resilience strategies and capabilities, as it faces “various risks and uncertainties” that, if realized, could materially impair its operations, financial condition and performance.  The report highlights its rapid adaptation to the COVID‐19 pandemic through “precautionary measures” such as a global flexwork program, emergency management and disaster‐recovery planning for natural disasters, and the ongoing evolution of its information technology, financial infrastructure and administrative systems to support business continuity amid component shortages, logistics delays and customer purchasing disruptions.  It describes the need to allocate resources effectively for continuous innovation, product introductions and system reconfigurations in response to rapidly evolving technological and market developments, to manage growth through strengthened processes and controls, and to integrate and retain key personnel to preserve organizational health and corporate culture.  The company also discloses risk mitigation mechanisms, including hedging against currency volatility, monitoring credit and liquidity exposures, enforcing internal controls under Section 404, and maintaining rigorous compliance programs, in order to preserve system integrity, absorb external pressures and sustain performance under pressure.  At the same time, it recognizes that failures in supply‐chain resilience, talent management, regulatory compliance, intellectual property protection or third‐party partnerships could reduce operational flexibility, disrupt customer relationships and impede its ability to respond effectively to adversity and maintain its competitive advantage.

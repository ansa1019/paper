Our annual report describes the maintenance of business continuity and adaptive capacity under a broad range of internal and external pressures, including macroeconomic volatility, supply-chain disruptions, severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, changing climate patterns that affect the price, availability and cost of goods and services, geopolitical events, labor disruptions and global health pandemics such as COVID-19 that altered consumer behaviors, store closures, reduced traffic and operational hours. We detail strategic responses and resilience strategies such as rapid adjustment to changing customer preferences and behaviors, investments in partner training and enhanced store wages to support operational flexibility and organizational health, innovations in digital, loyalty and delivery channels to preserve customer connections, expansion of alternative store formats for continuity of service, and initiatives to mitigate risk through supply-chain diversification and climate-related sustainability programs. Our reinvention plan, designed to improve partner and customer experiences while simplifying operations, reflects a systemic perspective on reconfiguring temporal trajectories of response to disruptive events, preserving integrity and performance under adversity. We disclose business continuity measures, including disaster recovery and incident response plans for information-technology systems, cyber-attack countermeasures and data protection, as well as financing strategies to absorb commodity price volatility through fixed-price contracts and hedging instruments, and to maintain liquidity via revolving credit and commercial paper programs. We recognize that failure of third-party providers to fulfill obligations, food-safety incidents, intellectual-property or regulatory non-compliance, and interruptions in our global network of licensees, joint ventures and suppliers could impair our performance, and we continuously assess risks and allocate resources to error prevention, risk assessment, dynamic capabilities and resource reconfiguration to secure our long-term resilience and competitive advantage.

We disclose that system failures and business disruptions may prevent us from providing reliable service, which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition, as we rely upon systems and networks—those of third-party suppliers and other providers, in addition to our own—to provide and support our service offerings. We have experienced criminal cyberattacks and could in the future be further harmed by disruption, data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or indirectly through third parties, and we expect to continue to be the target of cyberattacks; our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information and to defend against cyberattacks must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever-evolving threat landscape and changing cybersecurity regulations. Physical damage, power surges or outages, equipment failure, severe weather, storms and natural disasters, public health crises, terrorist attacks, political instability and volatility, chronic changes in physical conditions such as sea-level rise or temperature shifts, human error, unauthorized access to our systems or those of our suppliers, supplier failures or delays, and system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network could cause us to lose customers and revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, or face fines, penalties, litigation or governmental investigations. To grow and remain competitive, we must adapt to changes in available technology, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to meet changing customer demands; enhancing our network, including the ongoing deployment of our 5G network, is subject to risks related to equipment changes, migration of customers from older technologies, regulatory permitting issues, supplier delays, implementation issues and customer dissatisfaction, any of which could cause delays, increased costs or reduced anticipated benefits. We rely on highly skilled personnel at all levels to achieve our objectives and believe our future success depends on our ability to recruit, hire, develop, motivate and retain talented personnel, while the new hybrid work model introduced during the global COVID-19 pandemic required us to change and evolve our company culture, which may impact our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. In connection with our merger, we continue to perform network rationalization activities to identify and eliminate duplicative networks, backhaul services and other agreements, decommission substantially all targeted macro sites, decommission certain small cell sites and distributed antenna systems, and migrate customers to the T-Mobile network and billing platforms, all to achieve merger synergies in network costs and operational efficiency. We have incurred, and expect to incur, significant restructuring and integration costs, including severance, store rationalization, network decommissioning and contract termination costs, and we expect to realize merger synergies of approximately $3.1 billion in cost of service reductions, $2.5 billion in SG&A reductions and $1.6 billion in avoided network expenses in 2023. We manage our liquidity through cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, debt issuances, financing leases, sales of receivables and a $7.5 billion revolving credit facility; we believe our principal sources of funding are sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity requirements, including payments associated with our restructuring initiatives. We also continue to monitor economic, political and market conditions—including interest rates, consumer credit, inflation, supply chain disruptions and geopolitical instability—as well as competition, industry consolidation and shifting customer demand, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

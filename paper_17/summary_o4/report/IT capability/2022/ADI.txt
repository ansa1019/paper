Global political, legal and economic uncertainty and adverse conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including crises such as trade and political disputes, changes in international relations, sanctions and export restrictions; we maintain significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States and rely on third-party suppliers and service providers for raw materials, wafer foundry, assembly and test services, and transportation, exposing us to risks in availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, costs, and supply chain allocations, including capacity constraints during industry demand spikes or geopolitical disruptions; a prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to equipment due to natural disasters, civil unrest or public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may disrupt operations, delay production and shipments, forgo revenue opportunities, erode market share and damage customer relationships; to support business continuity and operational flexibility we leverage an outsourcing model complemented by internal manufacturing capacity across multiple geographies, maintain high-credit-quality cash and cash equivalents with diversified counterparties, continually monitor credit exposure, and hedge non-U.S.-dollar exposures through forward foreign currency contracts to mitigate market risk; we believe that our existing sources of liquidity, together with anticipated short- and long-term financing—including a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with covenant compliance—will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months; our future success depends on executing our business strategy, sustaining innovation through significant R&D investment, expanding internal manufacturing capacity (with fiscal 2023 capital expenditures expected at 6 to 8 percent of revenue), integrating acquisitions to reconfigure and enhance core capabilities, and adapting our financing arrangements—such as sustainability-linked pricing tied to greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy usage—to align with evolving environmental, social and governance expectations, all of which are critical to preserving integrity, performance and adaptability under internal and external pressures.

The company acknowledges its reliance on complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and to securely process, transmit and store electronic information, and it recognizes that its IT infrastructure—including software, mobile devices, cloud services, open‐source software, Internet of Things endpoints and AI‐driven tools—is subject to evolving cybersecurity threats such as malware, ransomware, social engineering, advanced persistent threats and supply chain compromises that it may be unable to anticipate, prevent, detect or remediate in a timely manner, potentially resulting in data loss, corruption, unauthorized disclosure, system downtime, financial loss, reputational harm, regulatory actions or legal liability. It notes the ongoing challenge of managing access controls and patching diverse and aging systems within a hybrid work environment, as well as the complexity of monitoring and enforcing security over its own networks and those of hundreds of third‐party IT vendors and service providers that host or access its global information systems infrastructure and cloud environments. The company further describes the risk that investments in technology systems, digital platforms, generative AI, analytics and technology partnerships may not deliver expected benefits, may become obsolete more quickly than anticipated or may require significant capital expenditures, and it cautions that failure to develop and enhance these technology capabilities cost‐efficiently, to integrate and rationalize technology effectively as part of workforce and real estate restructuring, or to maintain adequate business continuity and disaster recovery plans could materially disrupt operations, impede responsiveness to digital disruption and competitive forces, and hinder its ability to support business processes, strategic initiatives and compliance with evolving global data privacy, cybersecurity and AI governance requirements such as GDPR, CCPA, UK GDPR, NYDFS cybersecurity regulations and emerging AI laws. In addition, it identifies integration of acquired businesses’ information systems as a complex process that may expose the company to unforeseen cyber vulnerabilities and acquisition‐related liabilities, and it highlights that strategic initiatives depend on the performance and reliability of key technology vendors and internally developed IT tools, such as its generative AI platform “LenAI,” whose governance and security controls may prove insufficient to fully mitigate novel technology risks or satisfy future regulatory scrutiny.

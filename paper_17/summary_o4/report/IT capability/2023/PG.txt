Procter & Gamble’s corporate functions explicitly include information technology among the company-level services, while its global business services organization provides scaled services in technology, process and data tools to enable sector business units, enterprise markets and corporate functions to better serve consumers and customers. The company relies extensively on information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems, networks and services—including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted or provided by third parties—to support core activities such as ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling products to consumers; collecting, transferring, storing and processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; summarizing and reporting results of operations; managing banking and liquidity systems and platforms; hosting, processing and sharing confidential research, business plans and financial information; collaborating via global business communications; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage the business. The risk factors disclosure highlights that any discontinuity or disruptions in the company’s internal information and data systems or those of its suppliers—whether due to cybersecurity incidents, power outages, telecommunications failures, malware or ransomware attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking, denial-of-service attacks or employee error—could interrupt product supply arrangements and adversely impact the ability to manage global operations, exposing P&G to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and legal harm. A significant information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of critical IT/OT systems, networks, hardware, processes or associated sites owned or operated by P&G or its service providers, could materially harm business operations, financial results and reputation, as numerous evolving threats pose risks to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of critical data and processes. The company also acknowledges that periodic upgrades or adoption of new technologies may introduce vulnerabilities or operational failures that affect its ability to order materials, produce and ship orders and process payments, potentially requiring substantial investments to repair or replace damaged or inoperative systems or backup infrastructure.

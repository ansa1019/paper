Boeing relies extensively on information technology systems and networks to operate our company and meet our business objectives, facing various cyber security threats, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems and networks, denial-of-service attacks, threats to our information technology infrastructure, ransomware and phishing attacks, and unauthorized access to company, customer and employee-sensitive information. As cyber threats increase in volume and sophistication, the risk to the security of these systems and networks—and to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data they house—continues to evolve, requiring constant vigilance and concerted, company-wide risk management efforts. To address these risks, we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems, contractual arrangements, tools and related services, and management and board oversight, yet acknowledge there is no guarantee these measures will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate cyber-related attacks or incidents or enable us to detect, report or respond adequately in a timely manner. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, cybersecurity incidents directly or through our supply chain and third-party service providers; while prior attacks at our wholly owned subsidiaries Boeing Distribution, Inc. in 2023 and Jeppesen Inc. in 2022 have not materially affected our business strategy or financial condition, we warn that future breaches could result in significant operational, regulatory or financial impacts. In addition, we manage information and information technology systems for certain customers and suppliers, many of whom face similar security threats; failure to protect against unauthorized access, release or corruption of confidential, classified or personally identifiable information could lead to loss of business, regulatory actions or material financial and reputational harm. Within our Global Services segment, Boeing offers data analytics and digital services alongside parts distribution, logistics and inventory services, maintenance, engineering, upgrades, and training and professional services, and notes that airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency; fleet support services—including information services and systems and technical data and documents—are expensed as incurred and have historically represented approximately one percent of total consolidated costs of products and services.

Our disclosures describe an environment in which competition increasingly hinges on the effective deployment and integration of digital technologies across our platforms—from adapting to technological change and extending our platform with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain to managing the collection, use and retention of large volumes of sensitive customer data with appropriate controls for accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access.  We devote significant resources to develop and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms, network security, high-availability capabilities and cloud-based architecture as we rely on our information technology and communications systems—and those of third-party internet-based and cloud computing providers—to support critical functions including development, marketing, operations, support, sales, accounting and financial reporting.  Our tax businesses’ ability to effectively handle extremely heavy demand during peak periods, our reliance on internal and external order-fulfillment systems, and our use of third-party distribution platforms such as Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store all illustrate our dependence on scalable, resilient IT infrastructure.  We continually invest in upgrading our systems and architecture, yet acknowledge that delays or integration challenges in system enhancements may cause outages, disrupt product launches or impede our ability to deliver new offerings and enhancements necessary for competitive advantage and business transformation.  Our ongoing hybrid workplace model further underscores the importance of robust security measures, annual workforce training, supply-chain oversight and comprehensive cybersecurity programs to mitigate risks from evolving cyber threats, regulatory changes, and third-party vulnerabilities, while ensuring that our technological governance and compliance frameworks remain aligned with rapidly changing laws and industry standards.

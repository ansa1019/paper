Berkshire notes that it “relies on technology in virtually all aspects of our business,” and acknowledges that its information systems have in the past been “subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial‐of‐service attacks and other cyber‐attacks” that could “result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties,” with “loss of assets and critical information” and “remediation costs and reputational damage” as potential outcomes; it further discloses steps taken to mitigate these risks through “business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis” but warns that failure “to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology” could leave the company at a competitive disadvantage, and that “cyber‐attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information”; additionally, Berkshire cites newly enacted “data privacy regulations” governing “the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities,” noting that “failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant economic penalties,” and emphasizes that political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to operating assets from cyber‐attacks “may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, … or may materially adversely affect us” in unpredictable ways.

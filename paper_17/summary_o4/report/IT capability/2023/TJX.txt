Compromises of our cybersecurity, disruptions in our information technology systems, or failure to satisfy the information technology needs of our business could result in material loss or liability, materially impact our operating results or materially harm our reputation. Our business depends on our information technology (“IT”) systems, which collect and process information of customers, associates and other third parties, and we rely heavily on these systems—including those operated and maintained by our suppliers and service providers—to manage key aspects of our business such as planning, purchasing, point-of-sale processing and e-commerce, supply chain and inventory management, human resources, financial management, communications, information security, and legal and regulatory compliance. Our ongoing operations and successful growth are dependent on accurately anticipating current and future IT needs, successfully developing, implementing, and maintaining appropriate systems, adopting new technologies in a timely manner, and maintaining effective disaster recovery plans and related back-up systems. As is common in the retail industry, our IT systems and those of our third parties are targeted by increasingly sophisticated malware, ransomware, phishing, social engineering, denial-of-service attacks, exploitation of system vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, and other cyber-attacks, and they may also be damaged or disrupted by power outages, system failures, catastrophic events, or human error, any of which could materially impair our ability to operate. Changes in the business landscape and the increase of remote working, together with geopolitical events outside our control, have heightened the risk of system damage or cybersecurity compromise and have driven the need for additional mitigation strategies and investments across our IT security workforce, technologies, and processes. The global regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, and cybersecurity compromises or disruptions in our IT systems could result in enforcement actions, class actions, contract liability, or other material legal exposure. Any successful compromise or disruption of our IT systems, or of information we collect or that is collected on our behalf, could cause material reputational harm, deter customers from shopping with us and impair our relationships with suppliers and service providers. We maintain policies, procedures, and controls designed to reduce cybersecurity and IT failure risks, but these controls vary in maturity, may be circumvented, and our logging policies and controls may be insufficient to fully investigate all events; moreover, the ongoing effort to update, enhance, modify, or replace our systems and infrastructure carries risks related to inaccurate data capture, inefficient testing and implementation of changes, failure to realize expected benefits, and diversion of internal teams’ attention. Information technology challenges are also recognized among the risks in sourcing and supply chain operations. The substantial size and scale of our business, including multiple banners and locations and autonomy across segments, increases the complexity of effectively administering and sharing information via our IT systems and of managing internal and third-party IT resources with appropriate oversight. We also plan significant capital expenditures for offices and distribution centers, including investments in buying and merchandising systems and other information systems, to support growth and operational efficiency.

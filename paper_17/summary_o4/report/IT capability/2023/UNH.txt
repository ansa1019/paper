UnitedHealth Group’s disclosures underscore the centrality of its information systems capability to business performance, warning that failure to maintain the integrity or availability of critical data, or to successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand its existing information systems and technology products, could materially and adversely affect operations, financial results and reputation. The company depends on the integrity and timeliness of rapidly expanding volumes of health care and administrative data to implement innovative services, automate administrative and clinical decision-making, price products, serve members and providers, and report results; as connectivity among technologies grows and consumer engagement demands more sophisticated mobile and AI/ML-driven tools, UnitedHealth anticipates that fast-evolving AI/ML technologies, including generative AI, will play an increasingly important role in both internal operations and customer-facing products. Sustaining this IT capability requires ongoing commitment of development and operational resources, adherence to responsible AI/ML design and use policies, and compliance with evolving privacy, security, technology and data laws and standards—ranging from HIPAA and the EU’s GDPR to PCI-DSS and emerging AI/ML regulations—while recognizing that software defects, interoperability issues, cyber-attacks, data security incidents, third-party vendor failures or inadequate system consolidation could lead to operational disruptions, regulatory sanctions, increased costs, reputational harm and higher-than-expected expenses.

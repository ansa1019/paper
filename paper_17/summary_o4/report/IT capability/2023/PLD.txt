Prologis warns that its business and operations could be materially disrupted by failures or compromises of its internal and hosted information technology systems, despite system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan, as these systems remain vulnerable to energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cybersecurity attacks such as malware, ransomware or unauthorized access. Any system failure or security incident may interrupt operations and require significant remediation costs, and third-party security events at vendors, sub-processors and service providers could similarly impact data and services through unauthorized information access or service disruption. The company further notes that rising email-borne threats, including phishing and business email compromise, pose financial and reputational risks and may necessitate additional personnel, consultants and protection technologies. Any compromise of security could violate privacy and other laws, expose Prologis to legal and financial liability, damage its reputation, lead to loss or misuse of information and erode confidence in its security measures, with remediation costs potentially not covered by its insurance. In addition, the company recognizes that technological changes—such as reconfiguration of supply chains, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 3D printing or other technologies—present risks that could affect its properties, operations and real estate values.

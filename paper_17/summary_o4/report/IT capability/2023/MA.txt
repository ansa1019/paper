Mastercard characterizes itself as a technology company in the global payments industry that “connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible,” operating a “unique and proprietary core global payments network” that switches (authorizes, clears and settles) payment transactions and a “multi-rail payments network” that includes both batch and real-time account-based ACH, while its value-added services—most notably cyber and intelligence solutions—are designed to allow all parties to transact securely, easily and with confidence and to provide proprietary insights through the principled and responsible use of consumer and merchant data. It reports that rapid and significant technological changes—including continuing developments in smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and blockchain, AI, machine learning, privacy enhancement and cybersecurity—could render its current technology obsolete or introduce new payment methods that place it at a competitive disadvantage, especially when industry-wide solutions and standards (such as EMV, tokenization or other safety and security technologies) or resistance from customers and merchants inhibit technology deployment. The company relies in part on third-party providers (including fintechs, digital players and mobile providers) for the development of and access to new technologies and notes that any inability of those providers to keep pace with technological developments—or notices from patent holders demanding license fees—could negatively impact its offerings. Mastercard emphasizes that its ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by intellectual property rights, by difficulty attracting and retaining employees with technology expertise, and by the complexity of managing evolving systems and products, including its real-time account-based payments platform, which requires careful oversight of its IT architecture and information security controls. It warns that information security incidents or account data compromise events—ranging from computer viruses and denial-of-service attacks to ransomware and social-engineering attacks—could disrupt its systems and networks, damage its reputation, increase costs and cause losses, particularly as “our operations rely on the secure transmission, storage and other processing of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal information and technology in our computer systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers.” In addition, evolving privacy, data protection, AI governance and data-localization laws compel the company to “constantly monitor our data practices and potentially change them when necessary or appropriate,” to enhance data management, governance and quality practices (including tailoring levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access), and to integrate multi-rail solutions in compliance with licensing, aml and cft obligations, underscoring the ongoing need to mobilize and combine IT-based resources—technology, knowledge, practices, management skills and process understanding—to support and transform business strategies, foster value-creation partnerships and maintain agility and competitive advantage.

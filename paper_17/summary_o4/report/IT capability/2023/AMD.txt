In its discussion of operational and technology risks, AMD cautions that it may encounter difficulties in operating its newly upgraded enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and that its business depends on the proper functioning of its internal business processes and information systems. The company emphasizes that it relies on technology hardware, software, cloud services, infrastructure, networks and systems (collectively, IT systems)—some of which it owns and manages and some of which are critical third-party IT systems, products and services—and that maintaining the availability, integrity and security of these IT systems and confidential data is critical to its business and reputation. AMD warns that IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations, compromise its intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and materially damage its financial condition and results of operations. It notes that AMD, its vendors and customers have been increasingly subject to cybersecurity attacks, risks and threats, including custom-crafted or AI-generated attacks, and that the increased prevalence of remote working arrangements creates additional operational risks and attack vectors. The company further observes that its network and storage applications—and those of its customers, business partners and third-party providers—may be breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions, potentially leading to unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of confidential data; reputational harm; litigation or regulatory investigations; significant remediation and compliance costs; and diversion of management’s attention and resources. AMD anticipates ongoing and increasing costs to enhance and implement information security controls—including upgrading application, computer and network security components; training personnel; investigating and responding to data security incidents; addressing related litigation or regulatory proceedings; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with evolving privacy and security regulations. It also discloses that its business processes and information systems must be sufficiently scalable to support growth and may require modifications or upgrades that impose substantial demands on management time, necessitate changes to internal control procedures and significant employee and third-party training. AMD is working to simplify its information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts—transitions that could cause disruptions—and is embracing mobility and cloud solutions to promote business efficiency, even as these practices create a more distributed IT environment that complicates visibility, control and compliance. Additionally, AMD outsources certain supply-chain logistics and information technology support functions—such as product distribution center operations, transportation management and help-desk support—and warns that third-party failures in these services could materially disrupt its internal operations and product distribution. Finally, AMD cautions that its products may not be fully compatible with some industry-standard software and hardware and that delays in correcting compatibility problems could materially adversely affect its business.

The company acknowledges that accelerated digital transformation across its semiconductor and display customers may intensify demand and strain manufacturing capacity, highlighting the critical role of information technology systems in enabling accurate forecasting, inventory management, resource allocation and the coordination of global operations. It periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems to better manage business processes, align its global organizations and support growth, but warns that failures or delays in such implementations could interrupt operations, impair productivity improvements and damage quality and reputation. The business relies on internally managed and third-party hosted IT infrastructure to collect, transmit, store and process data—ranging from customer and financial information to manufacturing metrics—and must ensure this data’s accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access. All IT systems are vulnerable to disruptions, outages and ever-more sophisticated cybersecurity incidents—including errors, misuse, unauthorized access, advanced persistent threats and AI-enabled attacks—so the company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other protective measures yet may still be unable to anticipate, prevent or remediate future breaches that could compromise intellectual property, critical data or operational continuity and trigger regulatory inquiries, litigation or reputational harm. The performance of geographically dispersed third-party providers of engineering, software development, IT services, data hosting and telecommunications functions is likewise critical, as any service interruptions could adversely impact manufacturing operations, internal communications and customer relationships. Finally, evolving laws, regulations and customer requirements concerning privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and confidentiality are increasing the company’s compliance burden and may necessitate further investment in IT capabilities and governance to avoid penalties and preserve competitive advantage.

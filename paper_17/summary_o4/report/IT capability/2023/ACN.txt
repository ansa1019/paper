The report discloses that the Company’s ability to generate and maintain client demand depends on its adaptation and expansion of services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and that a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect its results; areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, as well as developments in AI (including generative AI), augmented and virtual reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum and edge computing, infrastructure and network engineering, intelligent connected products, digital engineering and manufacturing and robotics solutions; the Company is applying AI to client services, service delivery and its own internal operations and faces competition from clients developing internal AI-related capabilities; it continues to experience growing demand to assist clients with application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and cybersecurity-as-a-service and to help transform operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and cost-saving objectives; the Company is dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among locations, people, clients, ecosystem partners and vendors; as reliance on mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services grows and more employees work remotely, the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, increasing the risk of security incidents and cyberattacks that could lead to shutdowns, disruptions or damage to its systems and those of its clients and partners and to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data; in providing services and solutions the Company often manages, utilizes and stores sensitive client, Accenture or third-party data, including personal data and proprietary information, and expects those activities to increase through AI, IoT and analytics; unauthorized disclosure, denial of access or other incidents involving such data—whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud, misappropriation, cybersecurity attacks or other acts—could damage reputation, disrupt business, cause client losses and result in significant financial exposure and legal liability; unauthorized access to or incidents involving its software and IT supply chain, software-as-a-service providers or information systems developed for clients could have a material adverse effect; cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding, sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them and of maintaining effective security measures and protocols; the Company is subject to numerous evolving and sometimes conflicting privacy and cybersecurity laws—including GDPR, UK GDPR, U.S. federal and state privacy legislation and other global data privacy and cybersecurity laws—which continue to increase compliance risk and cost and to impose significant penalties for noncompliance; the technology companies and ecosystem partners are increasingly able to offer integrated software, platform, cloud migration and other solutions that may reduce demand for traditional integration services; extended disruptions of utilities, network or cloud services at the Company’s facilities or where employees work remotely, as well as destructive cyberattacks, could impede its ability to serve clients; and its global delivery model, heavily concentrated in large delivery centers in India and the Philippines, presents operational and geopolitical risks to the continuity and efficiency of its IT-enabled service delivery.

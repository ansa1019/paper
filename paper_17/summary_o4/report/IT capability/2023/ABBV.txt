AbbVie’s operations are significantly supported by complex information technology systems and sophisticated software applications (including cloud services) that enable its business processes such as research and development, manufacturing, commercialization, promotion and sales, and the Company relies on these IT systems both internally and via third-party service providers. Any failure, significant disruption or breach of these systems could impair critical business functions and expose sensitive data—including intellectual property, trade secrets and personal information—to unauthorized access, potentially resulting in lost revenue, legal or regulatory liabilities, reputational harm and substantial remediation costs. Cybersecurity attacks and incidents are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and despite AbbVie’s investments in data and IT protection and ongoing system monitoring, vulnerabilities remain; moreover, its cyber insurance may not fully cover potential financial, legal or reputational losses. AbbVie’s dependence on third parties for information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services reduces its oversight and control and subjects it to the legal, regulatory, privacy, security and market risks of those providers, and any failure by a critical third-party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie’s operations and results of operations.

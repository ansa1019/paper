We continue to expand our offerings of online transactions and services worldwide, thereby increasing our reliance on and coordination of information technology networks, and we are exposed to security risks and disruptions in communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. Our operating results and reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity events, breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, suppliers and other third parties, which could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, ransomware, malware, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, nation‐state espionage, employee malfeasance or human error. Such events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary or personal data; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations (including our online services, platforms and transactions); or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages. Cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, suppliers and other third parties are frequent, increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving, thereby making them more difficult to detect, mitigate and defend against. We rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services, including critical manufacturing equipment and technology development, and acknowledge that a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. In addition, compliance with data privacy and protection laws and regulations is onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business or to leverage our information technology capabilities to support or enhance our global operations.

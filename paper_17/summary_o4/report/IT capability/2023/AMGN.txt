Our operations depend heavily on sophisticated information technology systems—comprising hardware, software, technology infrastructure, online sites and networks for both internal and external operations, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties—and these systems are highly integrated into our research and development efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. In our hybrid work environment, reliance on both internal and third-party IT systems has increased substantially, and internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of these systems and data could significantly interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation. The complexity and interconnected nature of our software and hardware make them vulnerable to breakdowns, service interruptions, software errors or defects, misconfiguration and other security vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to frequent perimeter network reconnaissance and scanning, phishing attacks, denial-of-service assaults and other cyberattacks, including those exploiting flaws in third-party or open-source software. We also store and process a high volume of sensitive data—intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory filings, strategic plans, sales forecasts, litigation materials and personal identifiable information—often through third-party service providers, and cybersecurity incidents affecting our vendors have required us to disconnect or remediate connections to their systems. While we continue to invest in monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical data and systems, there can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program, policies, controls and procedures will be fully implemented or effective in preventing cyberattacks or breaches that could result in the loss or exposure of critical, proprietary, private or otherwise sensitive data and cause material financial, legal, operational or reputational harm.

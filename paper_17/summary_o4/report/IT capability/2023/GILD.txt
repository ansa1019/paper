We periodically implement or upgrade new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and other information systems to better manage our business operations, align our global organizations and enable future growth, recognizing that such implementations require significant personnel, training and financial resources and entail risks to our business operations; failure to successfully implement or upgrade these systems, or delays and difficulties in doing so, could prevent us from realizing anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, lead to operational difficulties in managing sales, manufacturing, R&D, financial reporting and other functions, cause quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, administrative and technical problems, and data migration issues, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including our Kite Konnect platform that is critical to maintain chain of identity and chain of custody of our cell therapy products, and the multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruptions or destruction from failures during system upgrades or implementations, user error, network or hardware failure, malicious intrusion or ransomware attack. Information system service interruptions or breaches, including significant cybersecurity incidents, could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and adversely affect our ability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments, report our financial results and protect critical or sensitive information—malicious actors increasingly employ harmful malware, exploitation of vulnerabilities, computer viruses, key loggers, ransomware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other methods to steal money, gain unauthorized data access, destroy or manipulate data and disrupt operations; our business continuity plans and cybersecurity protocols may not effectively mitigate such incidents, and our and our third-party partners’ security breaches could result in significant losses, brand and reputational harm, potential liability, increased costs to comply with evolving global data privacy and security regulations, or even prevent us from offering certain services in affected jurisdictions.

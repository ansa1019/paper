Abbott depends on sophisticated information systems and protected personal data, maintaining and processing sensitive health and personal information across its global operations. The size and complexity of these systems for both infrastructure and products make them susceptible to cybersecurity incidents, breakdowns, loss of data privacy or other significant disruptions, with malware and third-party hacking attempts posing ongoing threats. Abbott collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, subject to regional and local data protection laws that may restrict data transfers across borders. To mitigate these risks, Abbott invests in its information systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data, continuously monitoring its systems for current or potential cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. Any significant cybersecurity incident or disruption affecting Abbott’s information systems or related products could materially impair its business, financial condition and results of operations. Abbott’s operations and performance also rely on its ability to manage a large and complex global supply chain—an effort that presumes robust IT architecture and coordination of assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships—while its capital expenditures include investments in information technology to upgrade and expand manufacturing, research and laboratory systems.

The firm’s disclosures emphasize that our operations and information systems—comprising the hardware, software, infrastructure, backup systems and other technology we own or use to collect, process, maintain, use, share, disseminate or dispose of information—are integral to the performance of our businesses and that our ability to conduct business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of these systems. We continue to have greater reliance on remote access tools and technology, employees’ personal systems and increased data utilization and dependence upon our information systems to operate our businesses remotely, including to support our leading digital banking platforms, which serve approximately 46 million active users, including 38 million active mobile users. Accordingly, we regularly update these systems to comply with legal, regulatory and operational requirements, acknowledging that implementing new or modified information systems and integrating them with existing systems entails significant costs and risks of business interruption. We have established information security controls, access management and cybersecurity programs designed to protect against information and security breaches, data misuse or destruction, technology failures and other threats—including those posed by third-party service providers, automation, artificial intelligence and robotics—and we recognize that system backup measures, manual processes and vendor infrastructures may not process data as effectively as primary systems, any inadequacy of which could adversely impact our ability to support critical operations, meet business needs, manage risk and ensure business continuity.

Thermo Fisher relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store sensitive electronic information and to manage a broad range of critical business processes—from supplier interactions and order fulfillment to billing, payments, shipping, customer support and contract compliance—and applies a risk-based approach to implementing security controls, reviewing third-party providers and conducting acquisition due diligence even though its disaster recovery planning may not cover every eventuality. The company acknowledges that hardware or software failures, natural disasters, power and telecommunications interruptions, data center or cloud service outages, privileged-account compromises, human error, sabotage, terrorist attacks, geopolitical events, malware, phishing, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks—particularly as threats become more sophisticated with advances in artificial intelligence—could materially interrupt its operations or its customers’ operations, delay production and shipments, impair product and service quality, result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, lead to legal claims, privacy-law penalties and increased remediation costs, and damage its reputation and key relationships. Despite leveraging data backups and security measures, its systems and products remain vulnerable to unauthorized access, data breaches and security update delays in customer environments, which may require actions such as network isolation, password changes or manual updates. As a global organization, it is subject to diverse data privacy and security laws and customer-imposed controls—including U.S. state breach statutes, export controls and the EU General Data Protection Regulation as well as local data-residency requirements—that govern the production, collection, processing, storage and transmission of confidential, personal and sensitive data; failure to maintain reliable IT systems and appropriate controls could result in costly enforcement actions, reputational harm, business interruptions and increased compliance burdens. Competitive positioning and growth strategies also depend on e-business capabilities, enhanced commercial tools, infrastructure and e-commerce platforms to support cross-selling, while productivity improvements and operational flexibility leverage process optimization methodologies, global sourcing initiatives and digital investments in connectivity and infrastructure to better mobilize IT-based resources in support of business strategies, deliver competitive advantage and sustain market responsiveness.

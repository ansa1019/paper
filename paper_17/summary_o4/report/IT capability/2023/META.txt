Facebookâ€™s ability to build, maintain and scale its technical infrastructure, including self-designed data centers, servers, network capacity and computing power, supports software and hardware systems that collect, store, process and transmit large volumes of data, deliver data signals for our advertising products and enable interoperability with third-party mobile operating systems, browsers, networks and standards; any disruptions, errors, bugs or vulnerabilities in these systems or in the coordination of these IT resources can lead to service outages or degraded performance, limiting our capacity to provide timely, reliable, secure and tailored information to users and to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in support of evolving business strategies. Our ad targeting and measurement tools rely on signals from both our own products and external websites, and we continue to make significant investments in AI initiatives, privacy-enhancing technologies and security measures to deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in combination with other organizational capabilities, yet legislative, regulatory, browser, and OS changes, as well as adjustments to our user data practices, can adversely impact our ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources, affecting ad performance, monetization, operational flexibility and competitive positioning. Furthermore, our ongoing metaverse strategy involves the development of augmented, mixed and virtual reality hardware, software and content, requiring further reconfiguration of technology infrastructure and specialized personnel capability to align long-term technology deployment with organizational goals and market opportunities.

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, including access to our FSD capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates, and cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD ongoing maintenance costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our supercharger network. We continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems, including the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such systems in the U.S. and abroad. While we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks, our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel compliance with data breach notification laws, subject us to litigation, regulatory investigation and oversight, mandatory corrective action, require verification of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, our service providers, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our or our service providers’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident or other disruption to our or our service providers’ systems. The implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time, support and cost, and disruptions may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and other applicable regulations. If we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, our proprietary information, including intellectual property and personal information, could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. Our products contain complex information technology systems; for example, our vehicles and energy storage products are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, products and their systems, malicious entities have attempted, and may continue to attempt, to gain unauthorized access to modify or control our products’ functionality, user interface, performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products, which could result in legal claims, regulatory investigations or loss of confidence in us and our products.

The company acknowledges that its expanding digital footprint and reliance on technology have materially affected its risk profile and operational performance.  It warns that “exposure to cyber risk is increasing systematically due to greater digital dependence,” that “catastrophic cyber event” scenarios are continuously evolving to evade established loss-mitigation controls, and that “a failure in our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties, including due to security breaches or cyber-attacks, could disrupt business, damage our reputation, and cause losses.”  The firm’s “operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information and assets, including in our computer systems and networks and those of third-party service providers,” and its ability “to adequately price products and services, to establish reserves, to provide effective, efficient and secure service to our customers, to value our investments and to timely and accurately report our financial results also depends significantly on the integrity and availability of the data we maintain.”  Although “we have implemented administrative and technical controls and have taken protective actions designed to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and to protect our information technology and assets,” these measures “may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access, viruses, malware or other malicious code or cyber-attack, ransomware, phishing scams or similar attempts to fraudulently induce our employees or others to take actions which compromise our information or information systems,” and as the “breadth and complexity of our security infrastructure continues to grow, the risk of a security event increases,” potentially requiring “significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.”  In parallel, the company is “subject to numerous federal, state and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information,” including the NYDFS cybersecurity regulation, the NAIC insurance data security model law, the EU GDPR, the California CCPA/CPRA, and Brazil’s LGPD, and it recognizes that “new or revised laws and regulations may require changes in our operations and increase compliance costs.”  It also notes that “regulatory standards relating to the use of artificial intelligence are evolving in the countries where we do business” and that “the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks.”  Furthermore, the report highlights that “recent technological advancements in the insurance industry and information technology industry present new and fast-evolving competitive risks as participants seek to increase transaction speeds, lower costs, and create new opportunities,” that companies are “increasing use of data analytics, artificial intelligence and other technology as part of their business strategy,” and that the company “will be at a competitive disadvantage if, over time, our competitors are more effective than us in their utilization of technology and evolving data analytics,” warning that failure “to anticipate or keep pace with these technological and other changes” could “limit our ability to compete in desired markets.”  Finally, the company describes its reliance on “analytical models to assist our decision-making in key areas, such as underwriting, claims, reserving, and catastrophe risks,” while cautioned that “actual results could differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses” because they are “subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis.”

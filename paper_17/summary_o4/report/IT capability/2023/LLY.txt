The company discloses that it faces risks from “ineffectiveness in reaching healthcare professionals, including digitally given the increase in virtual engagements,” reflecting an evolving reliance on digital channels and platforms to support marketing and product launch activities. It further notes that important confidential information is stored in “our information systems, networks, and facilities or those of third parties” and that it relies “to a large extent, on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, infrastructure, cloud technologies, and hardware.” The company acknowledges that “some third-party IT systems that are necessary for the operation of our business processes are maintained outside of our control,” exposing it to system inadequacies, inadequate controls or procedures, operating failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, ransomware, or cyber-attacks that “could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights; result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure, or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on IT systems or business processes; damage our operations, patient and other relationships, or reputation; undermine integration activities or otherwise delay or prevent the launch of acquired products; result in unfavorable clinical trial results by virtue of incorrect or unreliable data; expose us to ransom payment, other demands, or paralyze our operations; give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws; require disclosure to government authorities and/or regulators; expose us to civil and criminal investigations; and/or cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages.” To address these risks, the company has “completed the implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which replaced our operating and financial systems,” and “recently began our post-implementation activities,” while also maintaining cyber liability insurance and implementing measures “to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our IT systems.” In its manufacturing and supply chain discussion, the company cites “equipment, mechanical, data, or IT system vulnerabilities” among potential causes of distribution delays or product shortages. Under its reliance on third-party relationships, the firm states that it outsources “hosting of, and support for, IT systems” to third parties, subject to the same security and performance risks. Finally, the company acknowledges emerging technology risks through its use of artificial intelligence, warning that “AI-generated content, analyses, or recommendations we utilize could be deficient,” that “platforms providing AI models are in many cases owned and operated by emerging companies with less contractual and compliance sophistication,” and that AI adoption “may exacerbate other risks, including those related to regulation, cybersecurity and other significant risks,” thus underscoring the strategic and operational importance of robust IT capabilities, governance, and risk management.

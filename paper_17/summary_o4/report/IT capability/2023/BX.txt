Our business is highly dependent on our technology platforms, including our analytical, financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems, and we rely on third-party service providers and cloud-based platforms to support fund administration and IT infrastructure; measures we implement to ensure the integrity of our systems may not provide adequate protection against continually evolving cyberattack techniques that may persist undetected and compromise our technology resources and data; cyber threats could result in the loss of data, interruptions in our business, damage to our reputation, regulatory intervention and financial losses; cybersecurity and data protection have become top regulatory priorities globally, and we and our funds’ portfolio companies face heightened compliance obligations under laws such as the GDPR, CPRA and evolving SEC rulemaking concerning cybersecurity risk management, privacy, breach notification and data governance, which impose significant costs and subject us to enforcement, reputational and third-party liability risks; rapidly developing global privacy and data security laws also expose us to complex and increasing compliance burdens and litigation risk; conflicts may arise if vendor partners mishandle confidential data or fail to adequately secure IT environment; technological innovation, including the development and implementation of AI, data science and other digital technologies and platforms, has the potential to disrupt our industry, and we must mobilize and deploy these technology resources, management capability and digital infrastructure in combination with our organizational and financial resources to support evolving business needs, digital transformation, operational flexibility and firm performance; AI initiatives present risks of flawed algorithms from inaccurate or incomplete training data, misuse of confidential information, third-party disclosures and unverified external statements, and U.S. and EU regulators are already imposing guidelines, reporting requirements and potential liabilities for AI safety, security and “greenwashing,” which could increase our legal, regulatory and compliance costs and challenge our ability to advance our IT capabilities into a sustainable competitive advantage.

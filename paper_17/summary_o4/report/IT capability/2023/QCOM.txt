The 10-K repeatedly emphasizes the firm’s dependence on and exposure of its information technology capability by describing the risks and management of security breaches and cyber-attacks on both its own and its suppliers’ IT systems, including unauthorized access, malware intrusions and ransom-style attacks that could result in misappropriation, theft, misuse or disclosure of proprietary, confidential or personal information and significant operational disruption. It discloses a comprehensive cybersecurity program aligned with international frameworks that seeks to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in its IT infrastructure and third-party software, the requirement to obtain and maintain cybersecurity certifications under customer contracts, and the obligation to comply with complex, evolving cybersecurity, privacy and data protection laws. The company acknowledges that its manufacturing operations, supply chain logistics and remote and hybrid workforce practices rely on secure IT resources and that failure to safeguard or adapt these systems could impair production, distribution, coordination of assets and internal processes, and customer relationships. It also notes that employees, former employees, joint-venture partners, customers and licensees with access to its technology and confidential information may wrongfully use or disclose that information, underscoring the importance of robust IT governance, capability leverage and process redesign. Finally, the report reflects the need to transform organizational processes and business models—to extend technologies into new industries and respond to market dynamics—which further underscores the critical role of mobilizing, deploying and reconfiguring IT-based resources in support of strategic decisions, operational flexibility and competitive advantage.

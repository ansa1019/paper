Bristol-Myers Squibb relies extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, security systems, hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some managed or hosted by third parties—to assist in conducting its business and to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships across functions such as research and development, manufacturing, marketing, selling, human resources, finance and data services.  The company makes ongoing investments in and efforts to maintain the security, integrity and reliability of these IT resources, yet faces evolving information security and cybersecurity risks—from cloud-based intrusions, phishing attempts, malware, ransomware and other forms of cyberattack to supply-chain and third-party vendor vulnerabilities—that could disrupt operations or result in the loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, confidential or personal information.  As the threat landscape grows in frequency, sophistication and intensity, including risks of undetected breaches, such incidents may trigger regulatory notifications, require remediation and damage the firm’s reputation, business continuity and financial condition.  Moreover, dependence on third-party IT providers and outsourcing partners for critical services and applications underscores the importance of robust IT governance, business continuity planning and the ability to mobilize, deploy and reconfigure IT-based resources in support of strategic business objectives.

Our operations depend heavily on the robustness and agility of our information technology infrastructure and systems, which support everything from order entry to supply-chain management, manufacturing execution, financial reporting, customer engagement, and remote collaboration. Any interruption of these IT systems—including cyberattacks, ransomware, malware, social engineering, denial-of-service, hardware or telecommunications failures, or unauthorized access by insiders or third-party vendors—could disrupt ordering, distribution, manufacturing processes, product functionality, or data integrity, potentially leading to business operation failures, delays in shipments, loss of customer confidence, or diversion of management resources. We require usernames and passwords, encryption, and authentication technologies to secure system access and data transmission, yet increasingly sophisticated attacks leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning tools may evade our defenses and those of our vendors. Inadequate allocation of resources to maintain, upgrade, and monitor our digital infrastructure, including our reliance on critical third-party service providers, could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, regulatory non-compliance, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personal information, including protected health information. Our shift to hybrid work arrangements, with a significant proportion of employees working remotely, has expanded our attack surface and heightened the need for resilient cybersecurity measures, change management protocols, and disaster recovery plans. We maintain network security programs, data encryption, and cyber insurance designed to mitigate these risks, but no system can guarantee absolute security, and any material breach could materially harm our financial condition, operating results, reputation, or ability to grow recurring revenue from service and software-enabled offerings.

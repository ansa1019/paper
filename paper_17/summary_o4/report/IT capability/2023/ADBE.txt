Adobe’s business critically depends on the availability of its information technology systems, many of which are hosted, managed and controlled directly by Adobe or third-party providers with limited redundancy and critical applications residing in single data centers, exposing the firm to risks of service interruptions, data loss or corruption, incomplete or inaccurate information, failure to meet committed service levels, regulatory notification requirements and reputational harm; transitions of data among data centers or to hosted environments may encounter unexpected interruptions and complexity, while failure to plan and expand infrastructure capacity proportionally with customer demand can lead to system outages, performance issues and potential compliance breaches. The firm’s products, services and solutions collect, store, manage and process sensitive third-party data on systems and networks that remain subject to cyberattacks, malware, social engineering and other cybersecurity incidents that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, use, loss or destruction of data, regulatory investigations, litigation exposure and increased costs. To mitigate these threats, Adobe devotes significant resources to engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features, code hardening, rigorous penetration testing, timely deployment of updates, outsourcing control reviews, auditing against information security frameworks, security training for personnel and continual enhancement of incident response processes, while acknowledging that no security measure provides absolute assurance. Adobe also relies on third-party relationships and technologies—including cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption, authentication technology, distribution platforms and critical systems such as company email and customer communication channels—and the failure to manage, develop or renew such relationships on favorable terms may increase expenses, cause service interruptions, invoke penalties or materially impair business performance. Revenue from subscription-based offerings is recognized ratably over the term of agreements that integrate on-premise or device-based software licenses with cloud services and features—such as Creative Cloud libraries, shared review, automatic cloud rendering and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted AI and machine learning framework—reflecting the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources to support business strategies and work processes. Investments in research and development, which include network operations, implementation and technical support personnel costs, hosting services, data center expenses and costs for computing equipment and software used in development activities, demonstrate Adobe’s commitment to enhancing its digital infrastructure and IT capabilities to drive product innovation, operational flexibility and competitive advantage. The company’s increasing incorporation of AI technologies and generative AI across its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud offerings underscores evolving information management capabilities, while nascent and evolving AI regulatory requirements may necessitate additional R&D investment, changes in IT governance, data localization and compliance frameworks and could impact the firm’s ability to tailor information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access in response to changing business needs and directions.

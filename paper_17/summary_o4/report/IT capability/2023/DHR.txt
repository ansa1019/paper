In the annual report on Form 10-K, the company identifies significant reliance on information technology systems, some managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities, including order fulfillment, billing, payments, shipping, customer support and contractual obligations. Some remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data, and certain products or software sold to customers connect to the companyâ€™s systems for maintenance or other purposes. These systems, products and services, including those acquired through business acquisitions, are susceptible to being damaged, disrupted or shut down due to cyber-attacks, system failures, human error or other unforeseen events, and existing system redundancy and disaster recovery plans may be inadequate. Security breaches of systems provided or enabled by the company, or of third-party suppliers, can result in misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data, interruption of operations, theft of intellectual property, damage to customer and partner relationships and reputational harm, and can lead to legal claims, liability and increased compliance and remediation costs. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify cybersecurity risks, and uncertainties with the development, deployment and use of AI could adversely impact the business, require additional investments and heighten legal and regulatory compliance costs. The company requires ongoing significant resource commitments to maintain, enhance and upgrade its IT systems to keep pace with advances in information processing technology, changing legal and regulatory standards, evolving customer expectations and new techniques used to obtain unauthorized access. A growing remote workforce further exposes the company to heightened cybersecurity and data privacy risks, and any inability to maintain reliable IT systems and appropriate global data privacy and security controls can result in adverse regulatory and business consequences, including litigation.

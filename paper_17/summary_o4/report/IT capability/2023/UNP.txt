The company discloses that it relies on information technology in all aspects of its business, including technology systems operated by the company or under third-party control and open-source software, and that failure to deploy sufficient capital to acquire, develop or maintain key systems—such as positive train control or the latest version of its transportation control systems—could result in service outages or competitive disadvantage. It devotes significant resources to protect its technology systems and proprietary data yet acknowledges ongoing cybersecurity risks, including the inability to guarantee that systems designed to identify, prevent or limit cyber incidents will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or to avoid a material adverse impact, and warns that security breaches could lead to unauthorized access to or loss of critical data, safety failures, operational disruptions, financial losses, regulatory fines, reputational harm or corruption of proprietary information. In its operational excellence and safety initiatives, the company has refined its proprietary Precision Train Builder software to evaluate train and route characteristics, simulate in-train forces to avoid handling beyond tolerance limits, and enable proactive intervention by its operating practices command center. It further plans to implement predictive technology through this command center to reduce variability, identify causes of mainline service interruptions, develop solutions and assist employees in applying best practices for train handling. Finally, the company intends to leverage data to identify and mitigate exposure to risk, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings and educate the public and law enforcement through a combination of internal risk assessment strategies, industry programs and community activities, and it identifies computer software among its other expenses supporting these capabilities.

Any breaches in our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the internet that cause unauthorized access to a customer’s data, our data or our IT systems, or the blockage or disablement of authorized access to our services; any interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements; our dependency on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties; frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach or sabotage our IT systems and infrastructure, including as a result of the increased use of AI technologies by bad actors; the continued evolution of our internal IT systems as we early adopt new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our IT systems; cyberattacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offerings operate, or on third-party cloud-computing platform providers; vulnerabilities resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings; vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on; vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from acquired companies; the acquisition of new companies, requiring us to incorporate and secure different or more complex IT environments; authorization by our customers to third-party technology providers to access their customer data, which may lead to our customers’ inability to protect their data that is stored on our servers; and our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing; defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services as our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software, third-party and open-source software; our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of third-party attempts to induce disclosure of sensitive information or coordinated attacks such as ransomware, destructive malware and distributed denial-of-service attacks; interruptions in our services; the storage and transmission of our customers’ and our customers’ customers’ proprietary and other sensitive data; the hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms that we rely on, including, for example, the large language models leveraged in our AI offerings, may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all; if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages; as we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we move or transfer our data and our customers’ data from time to time; we currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries; any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services and harm our business; as we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, our exposure to damage from service interruptions or other performance or quality issues may increase; we have experienced and may in the future experience defects in our products that created vulnerabilities that inadvertently permitted access to protected customer data; we have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur; the deployment of AI technologies in our offerings and the evolving use of generative AI may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed, or contains copyrighted or other protected material; our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, which requires that we continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in hardware, software, communication, browser, app development platform and database technologies; any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce demand for our services; we regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems and processes, and if the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems and processes or in migrating away from our existing systems and processes, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted; for example, our efforts to further automate our processes for customer contracts may be complicated by unanticipated operating difficulties; our success depends substantially on our ability to scale our operations and increase productivity, including investing in human capital software and infrastructure to support the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, and to expand into new geographic areas; acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve numerous risks, including potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings, difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services, and difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms; our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of professional and technical support services; if customers are not satisfied with the quality and timing of work by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the situation and the customer’s dissatisfaction with the services received could negatively impact our ability to sell our other offerings to that customer or retain existing customers; our board of directors, cybersecurity and privacy committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as updates on cybersecurity events; privacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, AI services, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services; the introduction of numerous new pieces of EU legislation related to the use of data, including in the DSA, the Data Act and AI Act, may impose additional rules and restrictions on the use of the data in our products and services; industry-specific regulations, such as guidelines for use of cloud computing services by financial services enterprises and incident reporting requirements under U.S. executive orders, may mandate specific controls or require regulatory approval; the inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards may have an adverse impact on our business; privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve, thereby potentially requiring changes to our practices and services, impacting cross-border data transfer mechanisms such as the invalidated EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework and newly adopted EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and requiring us to implement offerings such as the Hyperforce EU operating zone; our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services; for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security or integrity of the data access, transmission or processing; social and ethical issues, particularly regarding AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm; we continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative AI across all products; our Customer 360 platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers; with Slack, we provide a digital headquarters where companies, employees, governments and stakeholders can create success from anywhere; we derive our subscription and support revenues from cloud services and term software licenses; we use data centers, hardware, software and cloud computing platforms provided by third parties to offer our services; our cost of subscription and support revenues includes expenses related to data center capacity and fees paid for the use of various third-party technology, services and data; we capitalize commissions to obtain subscription revenue contracts and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis as a component of marketing and sales expenses; we incur depreciation and amortization related to data centers and equipment; significant additional investments in infrastructure have been and will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, including investments in human capital software, data centers, cloud computing platforms and real estate; we plan to continue to upgrade or replace internal systems and processes to scale with our overall growth; during fiscal 2024 we repurchased $7.7 billion of our common stock under our share repurchase program; in February 2024 we announced our first-ever cash dividend and a quarterly dividend policy; and any failure to maintain, enhance or protect our infrastructure and technology deployments could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

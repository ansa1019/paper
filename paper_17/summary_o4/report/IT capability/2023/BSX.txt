The annual report acknowledges that digital technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine-learning capabilities, are playing an ever-greater role in the firm’s competitive and operating environments, its R&D pipeline and product portfolio, and that it will need to develop new and enhanced digital capabilities and competences to remain competitive.  It further discloses reliance on information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems—both in-house and from third-party vendors—to manufacture and ship products and to process, transmit and store electronic information, noting that the size and complexity of these systems expose the company to cybersecurity risks (including cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, supply-chain malware and social-engineering schemes), system failures, data privacy breaches, regulatory non-compliance, ransomware demands and business disruptions from power outages, natural disasters or rapid changes in information processing technology and regulatory standards.  The company stresses that maintaining, protecting, enhancing and integrating these systems (including those of acquired businesses) requires continuous investment, robust incident-response, disaster-recovery and business-continuity planning, and strict adherence to privacy and security laws such as GDPR and U.S. federal and state requirements, in order to safeguard patient data, intellectual property and proprietary information and to support ongoing operational flexibility and strategic decision-making.

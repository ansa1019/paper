Visa describes itself as “a global payments technology company” providing “transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement) to our financial institution and merchant clients through Visanet, our proprietary advanced transaction processing network,” and offers “products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable, and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem.” The report notes that “innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services,” including “tokenization, push payments, and new flows (e.g., Visa B2B Connect),” while acknowledging that these expansions can “bring increased licensing or authorization requirements” and “expand the potential scope of regulatory influence.” It highlights that “the global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change, including increased proliferation of mobile and other proximity and in-app payment technologies, ecommerce, tokenization, cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, cloud-based encryption and authorization, and new authentication technologies such as biometrics, FIDO2.0, 3D Secure 2.0 and dynamic cardholder verification values (DCVV2).” The company states it “works closely with third parties, including potential competitors, for the development of, and access to, new technologies,” though it concedes “it is difficult to predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated.” It also observes that “rapid adoption and novel uses of generative AI across the marketplace may…introduce unique and unpredictable security risks to our systems, information, and the payments ecosystem,” and that “we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing the development, use, and deployment of AI technologies,” including complex privacy and data protection regimes that “may increase the complexity of our compliance operations, entail substantial expenses, divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and limit the services we are able to offer.” Emphasizing resilience, Visa warns that “disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business,” detailing potential causes ranging from “hardware, software and network failures” to “malware…internal design…manual or user errors…cyber-attacks, terrorism” and “supply chain disruptions” to its data center infrastructure. It further cautions that “numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks, targeted attacks against our employees and trusted partners, synthetic media threats such as phishing, deepfake or social engineering schemes…could compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data in our systems or the systems of our third-party service providers,” and that “the security measures and procedures … may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks or system failures.” Finally, Visa warns that “if we or our partners fail to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space in a timely manner, it could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services to our clients, impact our intellectual property or licensing rights, harm our business and impact our future growth.”

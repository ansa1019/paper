The Company’s risk disclosures highlight the critical role of its information technology systems and related capabilities in supporting and safeguarding its operations, data and regulatory compliance.  The report warns that breakdowns or breaches of those systems—from software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attacks, malware, ransomware or employee misuse—could interrupt business processes or expose the Company to liability, and notes that, despite the implementation of security measures, a business continuity plan and cyber liability insurance, such incidents remain difficult to prevent and may incur significant legal, operational and reputational costs.  The Company also emphasizes its reliance on IT systems for the collection, storage, transmission and protection of confidential personal, clinical and intellectual property data, and acknowledges the complexity and expense of maintaining compliance with evolving global data privacy and security laws (including the GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA-related requirements, and analogous statutes in numerous jurisdictions), cloud service dependencies, remote-work environments, and third-party vendor relationships that may heighten vulnerability to unauthorized access or disclosure.  In addition, the Company notes that its regulated processes for pre-clinical and clinical trials, manufacturing and quality systems are subject to continuous review and inspection by the FDA and other authorities, and that any failure of its IT-supported systems to comply with applicable regulations could result in delays or restrictions on regulatory filings, product approvals or marketing authorizations.  Finally, the report underscores that the use of social media platforms and advanced tools such as artificial intelligence introduces further challenges for safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring accurate public communications, thereby reinforcing the need for robust information management, cybersecurity, and governance practices as integral components of the Company’s overall operational and strategic capabilities.

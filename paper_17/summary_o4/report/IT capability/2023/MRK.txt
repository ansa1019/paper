Merck reports that it is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure and cloud service providers to conduct critical operations, support manufacturing, research and sales processes, and replace outmoded technology to improve process efficiency and data acquisition, while also commercializing digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products within its animal health segment. The company relies on third-party suppliers, distributors and service providers for development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, including support for its IT systems, and continuously monitors data, IT and personnel usage of its systems to mitigate cyber-attack threats, unauthorized access or disclosure of confidential information. Social media and mobile messaging platforms present additional risks of information leakage, brand damage and legal exposures from improper collection or dissemination of personally identifiable information. Furthermore, Merck acknowledges that the growing use of artificial intelligence systems to automate processes, analyze data and support decision-making introduces inherent operational, security, regulatory and ethical risks, and that any disruption, degradation or manipulation of its IT systems could materially adversely affect its worldwide operations, competitive capabilities and business performance.

In the course of our global financial services and insurance operations we have become highly dependent on information systems and digital infrastructure to coordinate our assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions, while supporting time-sensitive trade life-cycle processing, data management and risk analytics. We rely on outsourced service providers for operational, accounting, data processing, policy administration and market-data systems, and we have established internal controls, business continuity programs and governance frameworks to oversee these third-party relationships. Our information management capability encompasses providing data and information to users with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access and tailoring these attributes as business needs evolve. We employ automated rules, machine learning and artificial intelligence models to enhance pricing, valuation and fraud detection, recognizing that flaws or errors in data or algorithms could materially affect our operations and require substantial remediation. Protecting our information technology infrastructure and digital platforms from cyber-attacks—including malware, ransomware, denial-of-service, social engineering and state-sponsored intrusions—is a top priority, as is compliance with global privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and emerging AI regulations. This strategic reliance on digital technologies and IT resources underpins our ability to deliver competitive, agile and secure services, drive operational efficiency and support informed decision-making across our firm, our investment vehicles and our insurance businesses.

The company’s risk disclosures emphasize that its competitive strength and operational resilience depend on its extensive information technology capability—encompassing the design and development of nearly the entire hardware, operating system and software application stack, the coordination of global supply chain and manufacturing processes, and the management of digital platforms such as its App Store ecosystem. The company devotes substantial resources to research and development, to network and data security—employing encryption, authentication technologies, multifactor authentication, continuous monitoring and incident response processes—and to business continuity and disaster-recovery measures, recognizing that complex information technology systems and infrastructure spanning telecommunications networks, supplier and vendor systems, and online services are subject to failures, system upgrades, natural disasters, power disruptions, cybersecurity attacks, ransomware, physical or electronic break-ins, or other disruptions that can prevent customer access, interfere with transactions or impede manufacturing and shipping. It also acknowledges that losses or unauthorized access to confidential or personal information, whether arising internally or via third parties, can give rise to material reputational, legal, operational and financial consequences. Furthermore, evolving regulatory requirements, litigation and investigations related to digital platforms, data protection, app distribution and privacy, including compliance with initiatives such as the EU Digital Markets Act, may necessitate changes to IT governance, system architecture and operational processes—potentially affecting service functionality, developer interactions, distribution mechanisms and revenue models.

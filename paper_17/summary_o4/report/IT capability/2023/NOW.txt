Our intelligent platform, the Now Platform, is described as a cloud-based solution with embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities that automates workflows across an entire enterprise by connecting disparate departments, systems and silos to unify and digitize business processes; to support this offering and meet the very high-performance expectations of our customers, we continue to invest in and optimize our IT infrastructure—including data center capacity, public cloud computing resources, geographic-specific service delivery models and IT systems architecture planning—and to enhance our information systems and processes to increase productivity, scale operations, expand into new geographic markets and develop new services, although such improvements are complex, costly and time consuming. The annual report warns that delays in improving our information systems and processes could interfere with our ability to support our existing and growing customer and employee base and could adversely impact our business. We must innovate in response to rapidly evolving digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, hyper-automation and low-code/no-code development, maintain continuous connectivity and secure data management capabilities—including accuracy, timeliness, reliability, confidentiality and compliance with evolving privacy, security and data residency regulations—and tailor our information management services to meet changing customer requirements. Our professional services and partner ecosystem deliver the technical and integration expertise required to implement and configure our offerings within customers’ digital environments, and we actively mitigate cybersecurity and supply-chain risks through vendor security reviews, continuous monitoring and incident response measures, acknowledging that vulnerabilities, misconfigurations or breaches could materially disrupt service availability, impair performance and harm our reputation and financial results.

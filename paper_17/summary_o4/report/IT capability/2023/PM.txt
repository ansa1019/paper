The company discloses that it increasingly relies on digital and third-party resources to support its finance, commercialization and information technology processes and that it and its partners “heavily rely on information technology networks and systems, including those connected to the internet, to help manage business processes and operations, including the collection, storage, interpretation, and processing of confidential, sensitive, personal and other data; internal and external communications; marketing and e-commerce activities; the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products; management of third-party business relationships; engagement with governmental authorities; innovation through research and development; and other activities necessary for business operations.” It warns that the failure or disruption of these networks and systems—whether through cybersecurity attacks, unauthorized attempts to corrupt or extract data, security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, human error or non-adherence to industry best practices—could place the company at a competitive disadvantage, cause reputational damage, result in data breaches or loss of intellectual property and sensitive data, trigger litigation or regulatory enforcement actions including significant fines or penalties, and materially disrupt operations and financial performance. The filing observes that cyber threats continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, making it “difficult to predict probability, frequency, and impact severity of security incidents,” and acknowledges that its cybersecurity risk program and third-party cybersecurity risk management framework may not fully identify or mitigate all risks. In response, the company states it continues to invest in administrative, technical and physical safeguards aligned with industry standards, evaluates preventive measures on an ongoing basis and refers to its governance framework in “Item 1C – Cybersecurity,” while cautioning that any failure to timely detect, respond to or remediate security incidents could lead to wide-ranging business interruptions, financial losses and reputational harm. The company further recognizes that evolving privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence and information security laws—such as the European GDPR and various U.S. federal and state statutes—may impose complex and sometimes inconsistent obligations, and that any actual or alleged non-compliance could result in business disruption, loss of consumer trust, litigation, regulatory fines or penalties. Finally, it notes that the growing use of digital media could accelerate the dissemination of inaccurate or misleading information about its reduced-risk products, with potential adverse effects on profitability and operational results.

The Company maintains a system of controls over the physical security of its facilities and manages and stores proprietary, sensitive, and confidential data relating to its operations, processing, storing, and transmitting large amounts of customer and employee information—including through cloud-based platforms—yet unauthorized persons, employees, former employees, nation states, or other parties may gain access to its technology infrastructure and systems to steal trade secrets, compromise confidential information, or create disruptions; cyberattacks—such as ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, worms, supply chain attacks, social engineering, open source vulnerabilities, or other malicious software or techniques designed to evade detection or remain dormant until a triggering event—pose a heightened risk, potentially resulting in significant losses, reputational harm, litigation exposure, increased resource requirements to correct defects or security vulnerabilities in sophisticated hardware, firmware, and applications, and damage to customer and supplier relationships; furthermore, although some products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect third-party content or user-generated data, they could still be hacked or compromised, underscoring the critical need to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources and governance practices to safeguard information, maintain operational continuity, and leverage IT capability as a strategic resource for competitive advantage.

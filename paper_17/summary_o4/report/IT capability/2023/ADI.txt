We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email. These information systems and those of our third-party service providers and strategic partners are susceptible to viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, other cyberattacks, hardware failures, power outages, telecommunication failures, user errors or other events, any of which could materially disrupt operations, misappropriate proprietary or personal data, expose us to liability or regulatory action, damage our reputation and result in lost sales and incremental costs. Certain of our products and services, including those that incorporate or are based upon software or artificial intelligence technology, must conform to evolving industry standards for quality, reliability and security and may contain defects, bugs or vulnerabilities that could cause data loss, security breaches or intellectual property theft and divert technical resources. We are subject to complex and evolving privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, such as the EU’s GDPR, China’s PIPL and California’s CCPA, whose scope, interpretation and cross-jurisdictional inconsistencies may limit adoption of our products and require substantial compliance efforts and costs. In addition, in performing U.S. government contracts and subcontracts, we must maintain secure facilities, obtain personnel security clearances and comply with frameworks including the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification. Any prolonged disruption or breach of our information technology systems, including those supporting internal communications or interactions with customers and suppliers, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

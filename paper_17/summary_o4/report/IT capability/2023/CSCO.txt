Cisco describes designing and selling a broad range of technologies that power the internet and integrating its product portfolios across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud to create highly secure, intelligent platforms for customers’ digital businesses, platforms designed to help customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks, underscoring the importance of connectivity, information management capability and IT resources in support of evolving business needs. The transformation of its business to deliver more software and subscription offerings recognized over time, and its shift from selling individual products and services to integrated architectures and solutions “in the manner in which customers wish to consume them,” reflect strategic resource allocation, capability leverage and operational flexibility. Cisco reports ongoing investments in programmable, flexible and virtual networks, security, digital transformation, IoT and cloud technologies, as well as partnerships with key suppliers to mitigate component shortages and optimize inventory and delivery plans, demonstrating coordination of internal processes, technology deployment and interfirm relationships. It emphasizes that trust and confidence in Cisco as an IT supplier are critical to market development, that an impairment of that trust could affect product demand, and that disruptions arising from the convergence of computing, networking, storage, software, virtualization and cloud within the enterprise data center may intensify competitive rivalry. Additionally, Cisco’s need to manage distribution channels, cultivate strategic alliances to offer complementary products and services, and compete under rapidly changing technology standards and market dynamics signals a sophisticated IT governance and management capability aimed at enhancing market responsiveness, value creation and performance linkage across the value chain.

Our disclosures underscore that our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other data and information in our information systems and networks and those of third-party service providers, and that cyber threats continue to evolve and may defeat the measures we or our third-party service providers take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. We devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes designed to protect the security of our information systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, conducting cyber due diligence during acquisitions but identifying post-acquisition weaknesses in acquired entities’ information systems and networks that expose us to unexpected liabilities. We are transitioning our technology to a cloud-based infrastructure, which is critical to developing and providing products and services, scaling our business for future growth, accurately maintaining data and otherwise operating our business, yet such implementations involve risks inherent in conversion to a new system—including loss of information, potential disruption and dependency on outsourced systems and communication links. Our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks and on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, websites and the internet; any impairments due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or regulation may harm our reputation and result in loss of customers. In addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data on our servers, and although we have disaster recovery plans with backup facilities for primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant and our disaster planning may not be sufficient or effective. We rely heavily on network systems and the internet and on certain critical databases, systems, applications and services (e.g. AWS) to support offerings and believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure stability, security and business continuity, but our business could be materially affected by system failures, data corruption, obsolescence, incompatibility with future product versions, or disruption at our or our third-party infrastructure service providers. We also do not have fully redundant systems for most smaller office locations and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services, which may compromise our ability to service and interact with clients. In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software, which require us to devote time and resources to remediation on a regular basis and may result in a material adverse effect despite our efforts. While enhancing existing products and developing new products often requires effective collaboration, change management and automation, certain new processes require manual data entry before automation, which subjects them to greater risk of human error, and our inability to innovate and compete with new or enhanced processes and technology could materially adversely impact our business. We outsource certain functions to third-party service providers to leverage specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies, but those providers may not perform to our standards, produce reliable results or maintain adequate safeguards, and their failures can result in material financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm, unauthorized access, system or network disruption and improper disclosure of confidential information.

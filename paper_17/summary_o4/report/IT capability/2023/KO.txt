The company acknowledges that its expanding reliance on information systems and digital technologies creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities, noting increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to its networks and reliance on cloud data storage and other IT service providers for key operations. It has made digitalization a top priority, seeking to deploy data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to streamline procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, collections, employee processes, consumer marketing and research and development, and to equip retail customers with more powerful digital tools and personalized experiences across e-commerce platforms, mobile applications and digital environments. Shifting consumer shopping patterns and competitive pressures driven by the digital evolution have led the company and its bottling partners to build e-commerce capabilities and to integrate digital commerce strategies into their business models. The company uses its information systems to process financial information for internal reporting, regulatory compliance and legal requirements, while depending on electronic communications among global locations and third parties. It faces potential operational and reputational harm, financial loss and regulatory sanctions if cybersecurity incidents result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential or personal data, and it continues to invest in personnel, technologies and training to mitigate these risks, although even robust measures may not fully prevent sophisticated attacks. Privacy and data protection laws impose evolving requirements for data collection, use, disclosure, retention and cross-border transfers, and emerging data localization rules could significantly increase operating costs. Although the company has procedures and a third-party risk management program to assess and monitor security and privacy practices of its technology partners and bottling system, limited control over their operations amplifies operational and compliance risks. These digital transformation initiatives, cybersecurity and privacy investments and evolving regulatory contexts underscore the firmâ€™s need to develop and maintain adaptable IT capabilities to support business strategy alignment, enable market agility, optimize processes and ensure organizational resilience.

In our risk disclosures, we emphasize that our operations depend on receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, and that preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data requires ongoing investment to maintain and enhance our information security and controls, with any unauthorized access, intrusion, infiltration, network disruption, ransom, denial of service or similar incident having the potential to disrupt continuity and harm our reputation. We warn that failure to keep pace with constant and rapid technological change, including as a result of artificial intelligence, or to respond timely by enhancing our current products and services and developing and introducing new products and services, could limit our growth, cause client attrition and impede our ability to compete. We acknowledge that hardware and software defects or malfunctions, ransomware, denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, human error and natural disasters could interrupt our products and services and that software defects, development delays or installation difficulties could expose us to liability and damage our reputation. Our integrated portfolio of IT-based solutions—including digital banking and account processing platforms, card issuer processing and network services, merchant acquiring and e-commerce solutions, our Clover® cloud-based POS and Carat™ operating systems, non-card digital payment software and fraud protection products—is designed to provide simpler, integrated and flexible systems that enable merchants and financial institutions to deliver a unified customer experience across mobile and online channels. We believe that data, and the insights enabled by data, can be used to create or enhance the products and services that we offer to our clients, and we expect to continue to expand our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning as part of our ongoing modernization of technology, operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation to support digital transformation and drive competitive advantage.

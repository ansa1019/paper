Our business and operations have experienced growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected, and to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. We may not be able to successfully implement, scale, or manage improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner, which could result in material disruptions of our operations and business. In order to anticipate and respond effectively to rapid technological changes and market developments, as well as evolving security threats, we must invest effectively in research and development to increase the reliability, availability, and scalability of our existing products and subscriptions and introduce new products and subscriptions, and we must continually change our products and expand our business strategy in response to changes in network infrastructure requirements, including the expanding use of cloud computing, while organizations are moving portions of their data to be managed by third parties, primarily infrastructure, platform, and application service providers, and may rely on such providers’ internal security measures. After our products and subscriptions are deployed within our end-customers’ networks, our end-customers depend on our technical support services, as well as the support of our channel partners, to resolve any issues relating to our products, and cost of subscription and support revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support and technical operations organizations, customer support and repair costs, third-party professional services costs, data center and cloud hosting service costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and capitalized software development costs, and shared costs, and we expect our cost of subscription and support revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows and adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increases. Our subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years, and we recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed, with the majority of our deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, which we monitor as it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. Product revenue is recognized at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license. Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, with research and development expense consisting primarily of personnel costs, prototype-related expenses, and shared costs, sales and marketing expense consisting primarily of personnel costs, including commission expense, market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and shared costs, and general and administrative expense consisting primarily of personnel costs and shared costs for our executive, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations, and we expect each to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our operations, scale our organizations, and support our business growth. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating activities have consisted of net income (losses) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities, and our largest source of cash provided by our operations is receipts from our billings, which we define as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, and consider a useful metric for management and investors, particularly as we monitor our near-term cash flows.

The company’s operations rely extensively on information technology networks and systems and other operational technologies, including internally-developed systems and third-party vendor platforms, to receive package-level information in advance, to move and track packages, to efficiently plan deliveries, to execute billing processes and to track and report financial and operational data, with franchise locations and subsidiaries similarly depending on these systems to manage their business processes and activities. These IT resources and systems, which encompass hosted software applications and smart-facility automation technologies, have increased susceptibilities to programming errors, defects, misconfigurations, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, ransomware, malware attacks, cyber-attacks (including state-sponsored threats), data exfiltration, insider misconduct, telecommunications failures and other disruptions, which could materially disrupt network-based performance and customer service, damage brand reputation and subject the company to litigation or regulatory scrutiny. The proliferation and rapid adoption of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, have further intensified cybersecurity risks, and the company has made and expects to continue making substantial investments in IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery capabilities, maintained cyber insurance and imposed contractual and procedural security requirements on third-party cloud and delivery service providers. In its strategy execution, the company continues to enhance customer engagement by combining its network with digital capabilities, expanding its digital access program, deploying “smart package smart facility” technology, making targeted acquisitions of technology-focused businesses and directing approximately half of its anticipated capital expenditures to network enhancement projects and other technology initiatives, thereby mobilizing IT resources in support of growth, operational efficiency and competitive differentiation.

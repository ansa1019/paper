As part of its ongoing efforts to support and enhance its subscription‐based service, the company discloses that it is “scaling our streaming service and introduc[ing] new features such as our new ad‐supported subscription plan” by “developing technology and utilizing third‐party ‘cloud’ computing, technology and other services,” and that it “has built our own content delivery network (‘open connect’)” and proprietary CDNs to stream high volumes of content efficiently while operating “recommendation and merchandising technology” to predict and tailor content for members.  It further explains that it “utilizes a combination of proprietary and third‐party technology” including Amazon Web Services for data processing and storage, integrated payment systems and device partnerships, and maintains “communications and computer hardware systems” in its facilities and through third-party providers to support user interfaces, infrastructure and back-end operations.  The company notes that its technology and development expenses cover personnel who test, maintain and modify its user interface, algorithms and infrastructure, and that marketing expenses include digital advertising linked to its technology platforms.  It cautions that the “reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties” is critical to member acquisition, retention and service delivery, and that these systems face “constantly evolving cybersecurity threats,” vulnerabilities from open source software, and risks of “unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property.”  To mitigate these risks, it “implements systems and processes to thwart hackers,” employs encryption and authentication technologies to secure billing and personal data, and conducts ongoing monitoring and updates, but warns that any disruption or failure of its cloud computing, content-delivery networks, recommendation engines, device compatibility or network interconnections—or changes in network operators’ usage‐based pricing or access policies—could “adversely impact our business,” operational efficiency and financial results.

Risk factors note that modification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business and internal controls, and product, system security and data breaches and cyber-attacks, including ransomware, malware, social-engineering and denial-of-service attacks, could disrupt our operations, impair financial results and damage our reputation. We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions—including Section 404 internal control assessments—and the efficient operation and scalability of these systems, along with cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technologies, email and other hosted services provided by third parties, is critical to our growth and operations. We continue to design and implement updated accounting functionality via a new ERP system, recognizing that ERP implementations may introduce quality issues or programming errors that could impact ongoing operations and timely, accurate financial reporting; failure to implement or update controls effectively could harm operating results or reporting obligations. We rely on third-party suppliers for critical business systems and lack full insight into their information security and data privacy practices, exposing us to supply-chain attacks, system vulnerabilities or disruptions; our response to security incidents may be hampered by limited access to third-party systems, logs and information. We hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information from partners and customers, and breaches or unapproved dissemination of such data could result in regulatory inquiries or actions, litigation, financial loss and reputational harm. To defend against security incidents, we continuously engineer more secure products, enhance reliability features, invest in supplier and internal security training programs and maintain security awareness initiatives, yet evolving threats and delays in remedial measures may prevent us from detecting or mitigating all vulnerabilities in our systems or third-party software, which could have material adverse effects on our business. We may also incorporate third-party and open-source datasets into our AI algorithms, which may be flawed, insufficient or biased and vulnerable to security incidents, underscoring the need to tailor data accuracy, reliability, timeliness, security and confidentiality in support of our evolving business needs.

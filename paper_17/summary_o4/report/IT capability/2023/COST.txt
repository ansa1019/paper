Throughout the report we emphasize that the availability and performance of our information technology systems are vital to our operations, with these systems processing a high volume of transactions, conducting payment transactions for multiple payment methods, tracking and valuing inventory, and producing critical business reports; failure to execute IT projects successfully or maintain system availability could materially disrupt our ability to procure goods, manage supply chains, operate warehouses, fulfill member orders and conduct financial and non-financial reporting. We are undertaking large technology and IT transformation initiatives and making substantial investments in digital resiliency—encompassing data centers, backup systems, network connectivity and cybersecurity controls—to guard against threats such as power outages, telecommunications failures, security breaches, viruses and catastrophic events; any debilitating failure of critical IT infrastructure or third-party networks would require significant resource allocations to restore services and could impair merchandising, distribution, member service and competitive position. We rely on IT systems and networks, some managed by external partners, to securely collect, store and process sensitive business, member and employee information in compliance with evolving global privacy and data protection regulations, including the EU’s GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act; nonetheless, increasing security threats, sophisticated cyber misconduct, vulnerabilities in hosted environments and limitations in our logging capabilities expose us to risks of unauthorized access, data corruption, reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement, operational disruption and increased remediation costs, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, competitive advantage and member confidence. In addition, we invest in our websites and mobile applications to deliver a relevant omnichannel experience and in technology-enabled acquisitions to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chains and delivery channels, while ensuring compliance with payment card industry standards and third-party processing requirements; failure to develop or maintain these IT capabilities efficiently and effectively could result in loss of competitive position, higher operational costs and diminished business performance.

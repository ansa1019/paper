Risk factors in the Annual Report repeatedly cite the evolution and growing complexity of Nike’s information technology systems and digital infrastructure across its value chain and business platforms.  The report notes “difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining Nike’s increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control,” as well as “interruptions in data and information technology systems” and consumer data‐security risks.  It highlights significant investments in “digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our Nike Direct operations,” and stresses that “our digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks and standards that we do not control,” while warning that failure “to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms” or “to provide attractive, effective, reliable, secure and user-friendly digital commerce platforms” could materially harm the business.  The report also underscores that “information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes,” spanning the supply chain—“including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution”—as well as financial reporting, retail operations and digital marketing, and it cautions that “cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems” or “service interruptions or shutdowns” could “cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations” or impede “our ability to engage in the digital space.”  Moreover, Nike acknowledges that reliance on “employee-owned devices for communications as well as hybrid work arrangements” and the need to integrate third-party services and networks add “additional operational risks to our information technology systems,” while its disaster-recovery and business-continuity planning must address potential “damage to our information technology systems or supply systems” so as not to disrupt product delivery or consumer experiences.

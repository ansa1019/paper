The company discloses that it depends on sophisticated software applications and global computing infrastructure to operate its online platforms and that it is undertaking a multi-year phased migration to integrate and upgrade information technology, payment, enterprise resource planning, and other systems, noting that any failure to implement or adapt these technologies in a timely manner could impede its ability to compete, raise acquisition costs, harm brand reputation, or otherwise negatively affect its results of operations. It emphasizes its ongoing investments in cloud computing and outsourced data center capacity, software licenses and maintenance, internally developed and third-party systems for transaction processing, order management, and financial reporting, and in enhancing payment capabilities to offer diverse, secure, and flexible consumer and partner payment options. The firm articulates a strategic vision for a “connected trip” that relies on combining IT-based resources with human capital and business process understanding to deliver personalized travel planning, booking, payment, and in-trip experiences, supported by robust loyalty and data-driven decision-making. It acknowledges escalated information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy risks—stemming from increasing data volumes, integration of AI and large language models, reliance on third-party distribution channels, app stores, meta-search engines, card schemes, and global distribution systems—and the need to expend significant resources on redundancy, monitoring systems, compliance with evolving regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, digital services taxes, e-privacy), and governance functions under new digital markets and services legislation. The company also warns that changes in platform logic, advertising algorithms, bidding restrictions, or third-party service interruptions could adversely affect traffic, market responsiveness, operational continuity, and transactional integrity, underscoring the critical role of continually mobilizing and reconfiguring its IT resources in concert with organizational capabilities, process optimization, and strategic alignment to sustain competitive advantage and business transformation.

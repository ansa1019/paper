Lowe’s disclosures emphasize the critical role of its evolving information technology capabilities in enabling an omnichannel retail model, noting that customers now engage through computers, tablets, mobile devices, websites and mobile apps—including online visualization and configuration tools—and depend on customer-facing technology systems that must function as designed to deliver consistent experiences. The company acknowledges that its strategic initiatives to adapt to changing shopping habits, personalization demands and competitive digital retail dynamics “have required us to deliver large, complex programs requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization, and program sequencing” and ongoing, actionable investments to maintain, improve, upgrade and modernize information systems supporting sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment. Lowe’s further warns that its ability to collect, use and share customer data with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access—amid evolving legislation, third-party policy changes and institutional governance—directly affects its market agility, competitive positioning and financial performance, and that failure to realize the benefits of technology investments could result in write-downs or write-offs. In support of these initiatives, the company is undertaking a multi-year technology transformation to update its merchandise selling system and key accounting and finance systems and must attract and retain skilled technology professionals while engaging third-party vendors for digital storage, content delivery and payment processing services. Recognizing the resource integration challenges inherent in mobilizing and deploying IT and other organizational resources, Lowe’s discloses that its own systems and those of its vendors are subject to damage, interruption or cybersecurity incidents—ranging from power outages, viruses and malicious attacks to distributed denial of service, ransomware and emerging AI-driven threats—and that increased remote access, remote-work infrastructure and pilot programs integrating generative artificial intelligence may intensify these risks, potentially leading to significant data loss, operational disruption, reputational harm, regulatory sanctions and increased costs to protect and remediate its technology infrastructure.

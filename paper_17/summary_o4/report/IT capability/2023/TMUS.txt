T-Mobile’s disclosures reflect an evolving reliance on applications, systems and networks—both owned and operated internally and provided by third-party cloud and technology partners—that underpin its coordination of network assets, internal processes, customer billing and intercompany transactions.  The company routinely integrates, upgrades and replaces legacy applications and outdated IT infrastructure within constrained timeframes, a complex undertaking that demands effective resource allocation, expansion of technology development capabilities, leveraging of artificial intelligence and emerging technologies, and access to subject-matter experts.  Any delays or failures in executing these modernization initiatives could impede compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, jeopardize reliable system performance and cybersecurity defenses, prolong recovery from outages, and degrade customer and employee experiences.  To offer services and support growth, T-Mobile continually invests in its network architecture—deploying 5G, enhancing capacity and introducing new service offerings—while navigating risks such as equipment changes, customer migrations from older technologies, scheduling and supplier delays, technological constraints and regulatory permitting issues.  The company’s ability to attract and retain customers depends on network quality and capacity, connectivity, customer service excellence and compelling digital value propositions, and it must adapt promptly to technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.  T-Mobile’s receipt, storage and transmission of sensitive customer, employee and corporate information requires information management capabilities characterized by accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and tailored access controls, and mandates continual enhancements to procedures and safeguards against ever-evolving cyberthreats.  While contractual rights allow assessment of many third-party systems and protocols, T-Mobile acknowledges limited visibility into all external providers’ controls and recognizes that investment of significant resources and management attention is required to evaluate, enhance and govern its entire technology portfolio.  Additionally, the company relies on a diverse set of suppliers for wireless and wireline network components, software development, billing and customer support, with the failure or inability of any party to deliver adequately posing potential operational, financial and reputational harm.

Nee and FPL are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems and network infrastructure, and any failure or breach of those systems could compromise confidential data, limit their ability to process and monitor a very large number of highly complex, geographically dispersed transactions and materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Due to the size, scope and complexity of their operations, the development, modification, replacement and maintenance of information systems to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging, involving risks in integrating new systems with existing processes, updating accounting procedures and controls and ensuring accurate and consistent data conversion, with disruptions potentially resulting in increased costs, inability to track or collect revenues, diversion of management’s and employees’ attention and resources, negative impacts on the control environment and impairment of their ability to timely file required regulatory reports. Additional risks arise from potential failures or capacity constraints in the information systems of third parties, including those providing power transmission and natural gas transportation services, and their retail businesses’ access to and provision of sensitive customer data for services such as call centers exposes them to the risk of breaches that could diminish customer confidence, lead to identity theft, reputational damage, regulatory fines and legal claims. Furthermore, cyberattacks, geopolitical factors, terrorism and the advancement of technologies such as artificial intelligence have increased vulnerabilities and potential entry points for attacks on their generation, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure, potentially limiting their ability to generate, purchase, store or transmit energy, bill customers, process payments and raise capital and resulting in significant additional costs, fines, penalties and reputational harm.

PepsiCo discloses that it depends on robust information systems and technology—including public websites and cloud-based services—to support a wide range of critical activities, from internal and external communications, ordering and inventory management, and facility operations to protecting confidential data, maintaining accurate financial records and meeting regulatory, reporting and tax requirements. The company warns that system shutdowns, degraded performance or security incidents—whether caused by cyberattacks, software or hardware failures, network or power outages, remote-work vulnerabilities, or malicious actions by employees, contractors or third parties—can result in processing inefficiencies, transaction errors, inability to access data or systems, lost revenue, data loss, legal and regulatory liabilities, reputational damage and loss of customers. To manage these risks and enable digital transformation, PepsiCo is investing in its information technology infrastructure, network security, disaster recovery, employee training and enterprise-wide systems solutions as part of its multi-year business transformation initiative, which includes migrating financial processing systems to standardized global platforms. The company also acknowledges that e-commerce and online-to-offline channels, digital marketing, artificial intelligence‐driven analytics and new digital tools for retailers and consumers require ongoing IT capability enhancements, while strategic transactions and integrations demand effective deployment and separation of IT systems. Finally, PepsiCo highlights the reliance on third-party service providers—such as software and cloud data service vendors—to support procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, IT support and administrative functions, noting that failures by these providers or supply-chain malware attacks can adversely affect its operations even if its own systems remain uncompromised.

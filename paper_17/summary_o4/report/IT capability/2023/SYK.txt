Stryker relies extensively on information technology systems to conduct business, including networks and services such as internet sites, cloud and software-as-a-service solutions, data hosting and processing facilities, tools and other hardware, software (including open-source software) and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in coordinating its assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions and relationships. this reliance exposes the company to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats that may compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data and product offerings, and the company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, security breaches or unauthorized access to products or systems. to address these threats and support its business strategies and processes, stryker has made, and continues to make, investments in monitoring of networks and systems, use of artificial intelligence, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, and it follows incident response protocols in accordance with applicable governmental regulations and other legal requirements. despite these measures, the increasing complexity and sophistication of cyberattack techniques may delay detection or mitigation, potentially compounding damage, and new regulations may require disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents before full resolution. a significant number of employees working remotely has further exposed the company to cybersecurity and cyber-liability risks. moreover, if the company’s IT systems are damaged, cease to function properly or suffer loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information, and if business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, stryker may incur reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. in addition, an inability to successfully manage the implementation of its new commercial global enterprise resource planning system, which will replace many existing operating and financial systems and is central to order processing, product shipment, service and customer support, invoicing, payment tracking and fulfillment of contractual obligations, could adversely affect the company’s operations and operating results.

Starbucks’ risk disclosures and MD&A describe multiple facets of their information technology capabilities and related requirements. In the Risk Factors section, the company warns that “our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising, promotional and marketing resources across different channels, including digital, allows us to reach consumers effectively and efficiently, and in ways that are meaningful to them,” and identifies as strategic initiatives “driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally.” Other operating expenses increased primarily due to “higher strategic investments in technology and other initiatives ($32 million)” and general and administrative expenses rose primarily due to “incremental investments in technology ($140 million),” support costs of strategic initiatives and performance-based compensation. Starbucks acknowledges that “many of our information technology systems (whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers, business partners and employees,” and that “similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems and databases,” which “to date … have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future.” The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of data or proprietary information “could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, a decrease in our ability to retain customers or attract new ones, the imposition of potentially significant costs … and the disruption to our supply chain, business and plans.” The company warns that “the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks,” and that “our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are not always complete or sufficiently granular, affecting our ability to fully understand the scope of security breaches.” Starbucks “continues to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.” The company “relies heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, including providing Starbucks digital solutions to participating licensees, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality.” It notes that “many of our non-store employees continue to work on a remote or hybrid basis, which has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure,” and that “the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems” and that “convenience-led formats … depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities.” The company “also rely[s] on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support,” but cautions that “our contractual and operational safeguards may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available,” and that if “our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results.” Starbucks further highlights its exposure to data privacy and protection laws, noting that “complex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data” and that “complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services.” It recognizes that privacy and data protection requirements “may impact Starbucks operation and new business models, such as Starbucks digital solutions, which rely on Starbucks functioning as controller of customer personal information in licensed markets,” and warns that “our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines and damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business.”

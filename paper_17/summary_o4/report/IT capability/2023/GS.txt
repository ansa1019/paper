The report emphasizes that “our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies” and warns that “a failure in our operational systems or human error, malfeasance or other misconduct, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses… and cause losses.” It similarly cautions that “a failure or disruption in our infrastructure, or in the operational systems or infrastructure of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses,” highlighting reliance on network interconnectivity, application programming interfaces and central agents. The report acknowledges that “the use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and businesses…and those of our third-party service providers and vendors,” that “cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing,” and that “service disruptions have resulted, and may result in the future, in delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to our businesses.” With respect to advanced analytics, it flags that “the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) present risks and challenges that may adversely impact our business,” noting both the challenges of model complexity and governance, and the risk that “we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent…over which we may have limited visibility.” Cybersecurity risks are underscored by statements that “a failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information…and our clients’ information, against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information…and cause losses,” and that “outsourced vendors,” “hybrid work arrangements” and “employee-owned devices” heighten such risks. Finally, the transition to a shorter settlement cycle is noted as increasing “operational risks with respect to reporting and timely settlement of transactions.”

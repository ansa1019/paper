The report discloses that we rely heavily on our “financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems,” noting that these systems “may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of tampering or a breach of our network security systems or otherwise,” and that “cyberattacks and other security threats could originate from a wide variety of sources” and “could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of investor or proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business and damage to our reputation.”  It underscores the importance of “provid[ing] data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access” and warns that “such measures may not be effective in all cases, especially because cyberattack techniques … change frequently or are not recognized until successful.”  The firm further recognizes that “our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, and the cost of maintaining such systems may increase,” that it depends on third-party service providers whose “interruptions or compromises” could impair fund operations, and that “our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm” from an infrastructure disruption.  The filing also highlights enhanced regulatory scrutiny of data privacy and cybersecurity, citing new breach-notification laws and the upcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation, and warns that “regulatory investigations” and “enhanced regulatory scrutiny” of information security could expose the firm to “significant losses, increased costs, liability … or reputational damage.”

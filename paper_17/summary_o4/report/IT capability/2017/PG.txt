We rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems, networks and services—including Internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed or hosted by third parties—to assist in conducting our business, such as ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, collecting, transferring, storing and processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, summarizing and reporting results of operations, hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information, collaborating globally, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, providing data security, and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. Global Business Services provides technology, processes and standard data tools to our global business units, selling and market operations and corporate functions, delivering world-class solutions at low cost with minimal capital investment. We continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments to address them, including monitoring of networks and systems, increasing information security skills, deploying employee security training and updating security policies for the company and its third-party providers, because an information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key IT systems, networks, hardware, processes or associated sites could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. Our ability to meet customers’ needs and achieve cost targets also depends on execution of supply chain optimizations and on the continuity of our internal information and data systems, and if our IT systems, networks or service providers fail to function properly or cause operational outages that our business continuity plans do not effectively address, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.

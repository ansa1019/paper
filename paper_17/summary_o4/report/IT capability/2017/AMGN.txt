Our price reporting data calculations are reviewed monthly and quarterly, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions and/or underlying data. We rely extensively on sophisticated information technology systems and network-connected control systems—some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties—to support our business objectives across research and development, clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and product sales and distribution. The complexity and interconnected nature of these systems, which contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data (including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials and personal information), makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdowns, service interruptions or cyberattacks. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt business operations, result in significant costs and affect our reputation. Such attacks could include key loggers, ransomware or other malware deployed via malicious websites, social engineering or other means, and could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access important data needed to develop, gain regulatory approval for, manufacture, sell and distribute our products. We also utilize third-party service providers to manage or transmit data, which may increase our risk, and security breaches affecting our wholesalers or other partners could impair our ability to deliver products to healthcare providers. Although we continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical or sensitive data and maintain cyber-liability insurance, there can be no assurance that our efforts or insurance coverage will fully prevent or cover losses arising from breakdowns, interruptions, attacks or breaches that could lead to financial, legal, business or reputational harm.

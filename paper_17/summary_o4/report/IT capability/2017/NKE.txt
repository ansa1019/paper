Nike’s disclosures note “difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining Nike’s increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; [and] consumer data security,” and warn that “if the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.” They describe the growing use of “digital commerce websites and mobile applications,” “social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers,” and stress that “any failure … to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers [and] have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.” Risks specific to digital commerce also include “diversion of sales from our and our retailers’ brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content.” The company cautions that it “depends on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services, across our supply chain [and] for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities,” and that failures “to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations” and require “significant capital investments to remediate the problem.” It also highlights “data security and privacy risks” arising from collecting “transactional and personal information” and the need to “comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data,” noting that “any breach … may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers’ personal information or a disruption of our business.” Finally, the management discussion describes the “Consumer Direct Offense” and the company’s strategy to “leverage the power of digital” by “driving growth in our higher gross margin DTC business, led by digital commerce,” and to make the supply chain “a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste and have long-term potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market.”

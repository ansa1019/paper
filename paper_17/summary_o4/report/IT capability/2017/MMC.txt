The company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store sensitive, confidential data and to support its global professional services, and it recognizes that its competitiveness and ability to meet evolving business needs depend on ongoing investments in and coordination of mobile devices, cloud services, social media, Internet-of-Things connectivity and other digital technologies. These information systems and related safety control systems, as well as those of numerous third-party providers, are potentially vulnerable to external threats such as cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and advanced persistent threats and to internal threats from improper actions by employees, vendors or other parties with legitimate access, creating significant challenges in data management, information reliability, security, confidentiality, access control and timely detection of compromises. The company must continually update, patch and upgrade its diverse, often aging platforms, integrate and standardize systems acquired through its vigorous acquisition activity, and deploy security safeguards such as data encryption and multi-factor authentication—measures that require substantial time and resources and may not fully prevent data loss, unauthorized disclosures or service interruptions. Its policies, employee training (including phishing prevention), procedures and technical safeguards may prove insufficient to prevent or detect improper access or breaches, and the firm is at risk that a successful attack, a failure in cloud or vendor-hosted systems or a business continuity event could disrupt operations, damage its infrastructure and reputation, divert personnel and lead to material financial and regulatory consequences. At the same time, the company acknowledges the threat of digital disruption and other technological change—from artificial intelligence and blockchain to new digital delivery models—and recognizes that failure to anticipate, deploy and leverage these digital capabilities effectively, or to execute key strategic technology initiatives with the support of critical vendors and partners, could adversely affect its market agility, operational flexibility, competitive positioning and ability to create business value.

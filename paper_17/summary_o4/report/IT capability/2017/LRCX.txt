Lam Research discloses that during periods of rapid growth or decline in customer demand it faces significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training and managing its workforce and supply chain infrastructure; that it relies upon critical information systems—including telecommunications, internet, corporate intranet, hardware and software applications, network communications and email—often owned or maintained by outsourced providers, vendors, contractors or cloud suppliers, to support core operations; that these systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure from viruses, malware, denial of service, defective code, power failures and physical damage, with potential compromise, loss or theft of proprietary or confidential company, customer, supplier or employee data; that although it has implemented ISO 27001-compliant security procedures, virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, access control and emergency recovery processes, these cannot be guaranteed fail-safe; and that inability to access these systems at critical times or unauthorized releases of data could adversely affect timely and efficient operations, results of operations and reputation. The company has experienced cyber-attacks without material adverse effect to date but notes the potential for future remediation costs, regulatory inquiries, litigation and uninsured losses; it also reports increased facility and information technology spending, ongoing reassessment of resource allocation choices including infrastructure and managed services to meet changing business needs, and a risk that outsourced providers may fail to perform or protect intellectual property in outsourced transactional and administrative functions.

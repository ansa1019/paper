Lockheed Martin’s business encompasses a broad portfolio of defense, homeland security and information technology products and services, and its information technology infrastructure and systems are protected by a dedicated computer incident response team (CIRT) responsible for defending against various cybersecurity threats, including unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks and sophisticated adversaries such as nation-state actors. The company conducts periodic employee training to prevent phishing attacks, implements threat detection and cybersecurity mitigation plans through its enterprise risk management program, and maintains rigorous disclosure controls and procedures to address potential reporting obligations arising from security breaches and restrictions on trading with material nonpublic information. In managing cyber and other security risks, Lockheed Martin relies on safeguards established by its customers, suppliers, subcontractors and venture partners—among them approximately 16,000 direct suppliers with diverse cybersecurity capabilities—and on compliance programs that extend to information systems capability, security governance and the resilience of critical data and networks throughout its global value chain.

UPS relies heavily on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to manage or support a wide variety of important business processes and activities throughout its operations, with technology used to receive package-level information in advance of physical receipt, track items through its delivery systems, efficiently plan deliveries, execute billing processes and track and report financial and operational data. Franchisees and acquired businesses also depend on IT systems to manage their business processes and activities, and the operation of UPS’s networks involves the storage and transmission of significant proprietary, sensitive and confidential data—including customer and employee personal information—that is regularly moved across national borders and subject to evolving privacy, data protection and data security regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and data localization laws. UPS information systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to software or database upgrades, hardware failures, power outages, cyber-attacks (including distributed denial of service), ransomware or malware, malicious insiders, telecommunications failures, human error or catastrophic events, and such disruptions could expose UPS, its customers and franchisees to loss or misuse of data, interruptions in service, damage to reputation, regulatory scrutiny and litigation. UPS also interacts with the IT networks and systems of third parties—such as cloud service providers, customers, franchisees and service providers—which may themselves be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or system failures, and security processes, protocols and contractual provisions may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of critical information and systems. In recognition of these risks, UPS has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans, and has deployed operational technologies such as its ORION route-optimization system to improve package sorting and delivery productivity, but it acknowledges that it is not fully insulated from data breaches or system disruptions, as evidenced by a 2014 malware intrusion at approximately 1% of its franchisee locations.

The company’s annual report discloses that it is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems and computing infrastructure (“IT systems”) to conduct critical operations and that disruption, degradation or manipulation of these IT systems could impact key business processes, expose confidential information, modify critical data or cause failures of critical operations. It warns that cyber-attacks against its IT systems could result in theft of trade secrets, intellectual property or sensitive personal information and acknowledges that the use of new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes can create new risks. The June 27, 2017 network cyber-attack, which disrupted worldwide manufacturing, research and sales operations, underscored the firm’s reliance on IT capability and the need to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources swiftly in response to such events. In response to this incident, the company implemented a variety of measures to enhance its systems, pursued an enterprise-wide effort to improve resiliency and speed of recovery and continues to monitor data, IT and personnel usage of company IT systems to reduce current or potential threats, while maintaining insurance coverage—subject to possible disputes—to mitigate costs resulting from cyber-attacks.

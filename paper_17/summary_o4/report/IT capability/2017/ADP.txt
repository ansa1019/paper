ADP emphasizes its role as a leading provider of cloud-based human capital management solutions—encompassing payroll, talent management, human resources and benefits administration, and time and attendance management—by continuously investing in product innovation, strategic platforms and service capabilities to strengthen its underlying business model and support sustainable long-term growth. The company relies heavily on its payroll, financial, accounting and other data processing systems, hosting applications in both company-operated and third-party data centers, and maintains disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans to safeguard client data, protect system integrity and ensure operational resiliency in the face of natural disasters, communications failures or malicious attacks. To remain competitive and responsive to rapid technological advances, regulatory complexity and changing client needs, ADP continually upgrades, enhances and expands its solutions, migrating clients from legacy environments to more innovative, seamless cloud-based offerings and integrating acquisitions of talent management technology providers to deepen its core capabilities. Its information management capability—collecting, hosting, transferring, using, storing and securing large volumes of personal and business information in compliance with evolving data privacy and security regulations—drives substantial resource allocation to develop and update security controls, implement programs to prevent, detect and respond to growing cyber-security threats, and amend business practices in response to laws such as GDPR. In fiscal 2017, the company incurred charges related to a multi-year service alignment initiative to align client service operations with its strategic platforms, further enhancing system interoperability, customer experience and operational efficiency. Together, these technology-enabled resources and controls underpin ADP’s agility, support its business strategies, protect its reputation and drive value creation.

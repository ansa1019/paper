We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced autopilot options, internet connectivity and free over-the-air software updates to provide additional safety, convenience and performance features, and we note that the operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and could conceivably contain latent defects and errors or be subject to external attacks, with issues experienced by customers including those related to software for the 17-inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12-volt battery in the Model S and seats and doors in the Model X. Our vehicles are designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates, and we have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, vehicles and systems; however, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify or alter our vehicles’ functionality, user interface and performance characteristics or to access data stored in or generated by the vehicle, and we encourage reporting of potential vulnerabilities via our security vulnerability reporting policy. We are continuously expanding and improving our information technology systems—including product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management and financial, tax and regulatory compliance systems—and maintain information technology measures designed to protect against system security risks, data breaches and cyber-attacks, while recognizing that disruptions of these systems could impair our ability to manage data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service vehicles, achieve and maintain compliance with tax and other applicable regulations, and could compromise our proprietary information and reputation. Our privacy policy is posted on our website, and we recognize that any failure by us or our vendors or business partners to comply with federal, state or international privacy, data protection or security laws—including the EU General Data Protection Regulation effective May 2018—could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions, fines, damages and other costs. In our energy generation and storage business, we record as deferred revenue fees collected for remote monitoring services and recognize these fees on a straight-line basis over the related service term, reflecting our reliance on connectivity and information management capability.

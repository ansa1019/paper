The company’s disclosures make clear that its information technology capabilities are central to its operations and expose it to a range of risks and investments.  It warns that if its security measures or those of its third-party data center hosting or cloud computing platform providers, or other service partners, are breached or fail, unauthorized access to a customer’s or its own proprietary and sensitive data—or the denial of authorized access to its IT systems—could occur, potentially harming its reputation and financial condition.  It notes that its services “involve the storage and transmission” of confidential data, that its security measures “may be compromised by employee error or malfeasance” or by increasingly sophisticated cyber-attack techniques that “grow more complex over time,” and that it “may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures” to prevent breaches.  The filings emphasize that its services “operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem” of hardware, proprietary software and third-party software, and that “a security vulnerability in one of these components” could trigger system defects or service disruptions.  It discloses that its “internal IT systems continue to evolve” as it “adapts new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers,” which increases complexity, and that it seeks to mitigate these risks through evolving business and data governance policies, internal security controls and an ability to “escalate and respond to known and potential risks.”  The company also relies on third-party data centers, hardware, licensed software, database software and cloud platforms worldwide—none of which it controls—and acknowledges that any failure, interruption or strain on these systems, or inadequate planning for infrastructure capacity, could impair service delivery, cause performance degradation or outages, require the integration of equivalent technology, and lead to significant costs, liability or lost customers.  To guard against these eventualities, it employs disaster-recovery and business-continuity arrangements, including near-real-time replication of customer data in alternate facilities, but concedes those facilities may be vulnerable to natural disasters, terrorism or administrative actions beyond its control.  Finally, it warns that evolving privacy, data-transfer and cloud-computing regulations may force changes to its service offerings to comply with new legal requirements, restrict global data storage, transfer or processing, impose onerous contractual obligations or fines, and thereby limit the use and adoption of its services or slow the pace of new sales.

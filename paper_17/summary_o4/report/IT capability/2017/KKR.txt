Our business depends on robust financial, accounting and other data-processing systems, as well as the information-technology infrastructure of third-party service providers, to coordinate internal processes, support transaction execution and settlement, secure confidential data, and accommodate continuing growth and new products.  Our public markets activities in particular require the timely, efficient and accurate processing and evaluation of transactions across multiple geographies and markets.  If these computer systems, software and networks do not operate properly, are disabled or prove incapable of scaling, we may suffer financial loss, operational interruption, regulatory intervention or reputational harm.  In addition, our and our portfolio companies’ systems are exposed to ongoing cyber-security threats—unauthorized access, theft, fraud, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, denial-of-service attacks and similar breaches—that could destroy data, disable systems or degrade functionality.  Regulatory and contractual requirements for data privacy, information security and breach notification—including the EU general data protection regulation—further raise our compliance burden and heighten the risks that third-party or internal technology failures, security incidents or deficiencies in cyber-security, data management or information-system monitoring will disrupt our operations or harm our clients and counterparties.

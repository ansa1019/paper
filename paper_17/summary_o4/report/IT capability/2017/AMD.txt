AMD’s operations are dependent on the proper functioning of its internal business processes and information systems, which must be sufficiently scalable, modified and upgraded to meet evolving business needs and support key functions; any interruption or failure of these systems can disrupt internal controls, manufacturing schedules, supply-chain logistics and product fulfillment. The company relies on third-party providers for IT services such as help-desk support, desktop applications, business and software support, server and storage administration, datacenter operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access, and failure to maintain visibility and control over this increasingly distributed IT environment—now encompassing mobility and cloud platforms—poses risks to business continuity. AMD’s network and storage applications, as well as those of its customers, partners and service providers, may be vulnerable to damage or disruption from power anomalies, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and system failures that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of proprietary and customer data, expose its intellectual property, lead to significant remediation costs, divert management focus, delay product development and harm its brand and financial results. The company maintains sensitive worker, customer and partner information and depends on robust security controls, processes and compliance measures to protect that information; shortcomings in these measures or in third-party security practices could materially adversely affect operations, regulatory compliance and stakeholder confidence.

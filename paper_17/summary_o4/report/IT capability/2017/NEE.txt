Threats from terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other disruptive activities pose a significant risk to NEE’s and FPL’s interconnected generation, transmission, distribution, fuel storage and information technology systems and other critical infrastructure, any of which could be direct targets of—or otherwise materially harmed by—such events and could limit the companies’ ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and natural gas, to bill customers and collect and process payments, and to develop and construct new or improved facilities, potentially resulting in increased costs, fines, penalties, reputational damage and impaired capital-raising capacity. NEE and FPL operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated IT systems and network infrastructure to process and monitor a very large number of complex, geographically dispersed transactions, and despite the implementation of security measures, those systems remain vulnerable to failure or unauthorized access due to operator error, severe weather, terrorism or cyber incidents, any of which could compromise sensitive confidential data and disrupt critical business functions, materially adversely affecting financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The companies routinely add, modify and replace information systems, a process that is costly and involves significant risks—including integrating new or replacement systems with existing processes and controls, implementing changes in accounting procedures, and ensuring accurate data conversion—and any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in these endeavors could lead to increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, diversion of management and employee resources or failure to timely file required regulatory reports. In their retail businesses, NEE and FPL must access sensitive customer data internally and provide it to vendors and service providers (such as call centers), and a significant breach of that data could severely damage reputation, diminish customer confidence, expose personal information to identity theft and subject the companies to breach-related costs, fines and legal claims, any of which may materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

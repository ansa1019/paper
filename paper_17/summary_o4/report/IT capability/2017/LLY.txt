The company relies heavily on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, infrastructure and hardware—both under its direct control and that of third parties—to accumulate, process, store and transmit large volumes of confidential information, including trade secrets, clinical trial data, corporate strategic and marketing plans, customer and employee personal information. Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these IT systems and business information is vital, yet they remain vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions, security breaches, malicious intrusions and increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks that are becoming more difficult to detect, mitigate or prevent. Failure, inadequacy or breach of the company’s information technology systems, infrastructure or business information could impair its ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights, interrupt product manufacturing or delivery of services that rely on IT systems, damage operations, customer relationships or reputation, or cause loss of competitive advantages; unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could also expose the company to sanctions under data privacy laws worldwide and undermine public trust. Although the company has implemented measures to prevent, detect, respond to and minimize these risks, it acknowledges that these measures may not be wholly successful, and that any such event could inflict material financial, legal, operational or reputational harm. In addition, the company’s reliance on third-party service providers for support of information technology systems further exposes it to risks arising from the failure of those partners to satisfy contractual, regulatory, confidentiality or performance obligations.

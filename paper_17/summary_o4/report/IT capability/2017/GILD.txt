Gilead discloses that it is dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including its newly implemented Kite Konnect platform, to manage critical business processes such as prescriber and patient experience, chain of identity and custody for Yescarta and the logistics of collecting, manufacturing and delivering patient-specific therapies; it acknowledges that the multitude and complexity of its computer systems render them inherently vulnerable to service interruptions, destruction, malicious intrusion, cyberattacks and random attack, any of which could disrupt operations, expose sensitive intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of employees, patients, customers or partners to unauthorized parties and result in financial, legal, regulatory or reputational harm; Gilead further recognizes that data privacy and security breaches—potentially exacerbated by evolving regulations such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation—could impose substantial fines or even prevent the company from offering certain services in affected jurisdictions; it notes that liability insurance may not be sufficient to cover claims arising from such breaches and that it relies on technology partners for development and maintenance of its digital infrastructure, making investment in cyber-security, system reliability, connectivity and compliance one of its key strategic resource allocations in support of its broader business-process focus and operational flexibility.

Our annual report describes how the large size and scale of our operations and the autonomy afforded to our various banners increase the risk that our systems, controls, practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout the company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations. We rely extensively on various information systems, including data centers, telecommunications systems, hardware, software and applications, to process and record transactions in our stores and e-commerce sites; to manage customer, vendor and associate data; to enable effective communication systems; to source, plan and track inventory; to manage logistics; to generate performance and financial reports; to comply with regulatory requirements; and to otherwise operate our e-commerce businesses. Supporting these internal and external systems requires effective and qualified, and in some cases specialized, teams, and as our systems evolve we must continue to hire, train, manage and retain these teams, including those needed to support our customized and legacy systems. Our information systems, and the third-party systems on which we rely, may be subjected to damage or interruption from a number of causes, including power outages; system failures; cyberattacks (including malware, ransomware or phishing attacks) and devices to tamper with payment or other systems (such as skimmers and shimmers); catastrophic events; and design or usage errors by associates, contractors or third-party providers, any of which could lead to business interruptions, reputational harm or liability. We modify, update and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time by adding new hardware, software and applications; maintaining, updating or replacing legacy programs; converting to global systems; integrating new service providers; adding enhanced functionality such as cloud-computing technologies and e-commerce solutions; and integrating newly acquired businesses, and these initiatives carry risks of not accurately capturing and maintaining data, inefficient testing and implementation, failure to realize expected benefits, and diversion of internal teamsâ€™ attention. In the ordinary course of our business we collect, store, process and transmit confidential business information and certain personal data (including customer payment card information) and rely in part on commercially available systems, software, hardware, services, tools and monitoring to provide security for this information, yet as with many companies in our industry we are subject to attempts to compromise our data security through external or internal threats or error, any of which could disrupt our operations; damage our reputation; impact our ability to attract and retain customers; violate applicable laws, regulations or agreements; and subject us to additional costs and liabilities. We also acknowledge the challenge of identifying consumer expectations for shopping through internet-based and digital or mobile channels and social media outlets, which entails making the right investments at the right time and speed, and we remain subject to evolving internet and e-commerce regulations, including data protection and privacy requirements such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, as well as information-technology challenges in our supply chain and third-party distribution and logistics operations.

The company identifies information technology system failures or network disruptions as a material risk, noting that “system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities,” and warning that such failures could “prevent access to the company’s online services, interfere with customer transactions or impede the manufacturing and shipping of the company’s products.” It further cautions that “losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, may occur,” despite devoting “significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data,” and maintaining “systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies.” The company shares confidential information with suppliers and third parties and “monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances.” In addition, it recognizes extensive obligations under federal, state and international data privacy laws governing the “collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information,” and observes that compliance with evolving privacy requirements may be “inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction,” potentially increasing costs and requiring changes to business practices. On the innovation and deployment side, the company emphasizes that it “designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services” and sells and delivers digital content and applications through platforms such as the iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store and Apple Music, while also relying on and licensing third-party digital content and digital rights management solutions that may impose additional technology development and security requirements.

Our disclosures emphasize that our businesses are highly dependent on advanced information‐processing systems and technology infrastructure to process and monitor very large volumes of complex, high–frequency transactions across global markets, support the information technology services we provide to clients, and comply with expanding real-time reporting requirements under legal and regulatory standards. We must continuously update and enhance our operational systems and infrastructure—including electronic trading platforms, order‐routing and execution infrastructure, systemic controls, model‐based risk and control systems, communication networks, data processing facilities, cloud-based services and software—to accommodate growth in our client base, geographical reach, regulatory obligations such as GDPR, encryption, surveillance and data on-shoring laws, and evolving market conditions, while also managing the integration risks and significant costs associated with system enhancements, training and new business integration. We rely on computing devices and phones, both firm-provided and employee-owned, which have inherent security vulnerabilities in hardware and software and require ongoing monitoring, protective measures, and remediation to guard against cyber attacks, data breaches, and ransomware, particularly as we expand mobile and cloud technologies. We recognize that distributed ledger technologies, including blockchain and cryptocurrencies, present nascent yet rapidly growing use cases and attendant exposures, given our facilitation of client activities in these areas and investments in related platforms, and we may be subject to operational failures or security breaches at third-party service providers and central counterparties. Despite our extensive and sophisticated risk and control frameworks, including business continuity plans, backtesting, model validation and independent oversight by specialized control and support functions, our ultimate reliance remains with our people, and any failures in our systems, infrastructure or in the timely detection and remediation of errors could impair our liquidity, disrupt operations, expose confidential information, damage our reputation and result in significant legal, regulatory and financial consequences.

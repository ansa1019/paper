The Company discloses that it maintains comprehensive systems of controls and confidentiality procedures over its facilities, network systems, proprietary information, and trade secrets—encompassing U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, licensing arrangements, non-disclosure and non-compete agreements, and other internal controls—and that it processes, stores, and transmits large volumes of sensitive data relating to customers and employees, which may be exposed to unauthorized access, malware, and other security breaches that could disrupt operations, compromise confidentiality, damage its reputation, or give rise to litigation. It further explains that it shares product design and process development activities with its IMFT joint-venture partner under cost-sharing arrangements, yet has limited operational control over that venture and may encounter difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures, thereby constraining its ability to coordinate and deploy process and product technology resources. To support future growth, operating efficiencies, and product quality, the Company must make significant capital investments in manufacturing and process technology, equipment, facilities, and research and development, and timely procurement of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment is critical to process transitions, cost reduction, production ramp-up, and sustaining competitive performance. The Company also faces risks that its confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable in some jurisdictions and that ongoing infringement claims could force technology redesign or licensing, all of which can affect its capacity to mobilize and leverage technology resources in support of its business strategies and work processes.

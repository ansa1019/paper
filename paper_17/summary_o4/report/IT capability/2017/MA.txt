Mastercard describes itself as a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide through its global payments processing network, facilitating the switching (authorization, clearing and settlement) of payment transactions and delivering related products and services.  The company emphasizes that its networks are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system, relying on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in its computer systems and networks, and it provides value-added offerings such as safety and security products, information services and consulting, loyalty and reward programs and issuer and acquirer processing.  Mastercard highlights its digital and mobile channel strategies and partnerships with technology companies (digital players and mobile providers) that leverage its technology, platforms and networks to deliver payment-related products and services quickly and efficiently, while warning that its inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact these relationships.  The report underscores rapid and significant technological changes—including developments in smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, machine learning and AI—that could render current technologies obsolete and affect its competitive position, innovation partnerships and strategic resource allocation.  The acquisition of Vocalink is noted as expanding its capability to process real-time account-based payment transactions and creating a multi-rail network for domestic and cross-border payment needs, while also introducing complex regulatory and operational risks in operating and integrating a new type of payments system.  Mastercard states that it maintains an information security program, a business continuity program and multiple levels of protection within its processing systems, continually tests its systems to address potential vulnerabilities and faces heightened risks from cyber-attacks, third-party processors and the unauthorized disclosure of account data.  It further acknowledges that its ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards (such as EMV and tokenization), resistance from customers or merchants, intellectual property rights of third parties and the need for ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, data analytics, process optimization and digital transformation to effectively support business needs, enhance operational efficiency and sustain competitive advantage.

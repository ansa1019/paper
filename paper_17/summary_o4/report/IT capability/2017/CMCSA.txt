Comcast’s disclosures emphasize that its ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies is critical to coordinating its assets, processes and interfirm relationships and to supporting and enhancing its business strategies and work processes. In the cable communications segment, the company continues to invest in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity, in line extensions for business services and in customer premise equipment such as wireless gateways that combine router, cable modem and voice adapter, as well as in its X1 IP-based video platform, cloud DVR technology and a network of over 18 million residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots, in order to deliver data and information with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality and connectivity and to tailor these offerings in response to changing consumer behavior and competitive dynamics. Technical and product support, network operations, service call and installation activities, product development, fulfillment and provisioning reflect the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to drive operational flexibility, process optimization and customer experience improvements. Comcast acknowledges that failure to choose or deploy technology and equipment that are as effective or attractive as competitors’, failure to employ technologies desired by consumers before competitors, or failure to execute technology initiatives such as DOCSIS 3.1 and FDX can adversely affect operations, and that executing these initiatives will entail additional costs. The company further recognizes that network and information systems and other technologies—spanning network management, customer service operations and programming delivery—are critical to its activities and subject to threats and attacks, security architecture vulnerabilities and system breakdowns that could disrupt services, compromise confidential customer, personnel or vendor information, or damage equipment and reputation, thereby necessitating an extensive security program, ongoing monitoring and updating, and potentially significant capital expenditures to protect, repair or replace systems and safeguard competitive advantage.

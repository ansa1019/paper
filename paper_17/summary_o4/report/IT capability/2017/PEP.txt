PepsiCo’s annual report emphasizes that the company relies extensively on information systems and technology, including third-party public websites and cloud-based services, to interface with customers and consumers, engage in marketing activities, order and manage materials from suppliers, manage inventory and facilities, conduct research and development, maintain accurate financial records, collect and store sensitive data, comply with regulatory and reporting requirements and enable operational efficiencies across its global operations and relationships. To support these work processes and business strategies, PepsiCo has entered into agreements with third-party service providers for information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and finance and accounting, and it continues to expand shared services and digital solutions to achieve cost savings and enhance business process focus. In pursuit of greater organizational integration and process optimization, the company is implementing a multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate key systems, including its financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide solutions, while enhancing the design and documentation of business processes and internal control over financial reporting. PepsiCo cautions that failure to allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain a robust information technology infrastructure, to deliver applications on time, to anticipate training needs or to coordinate with third-party cloud-based vendors could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, disruption of business processes, lost revenues, or loss of competitive advantage. Moreover, PepsiCo highlights the criticality of upgrading security policies, monitoring networks and systems, and preparing for cyberattacks or other cyber incidents—including extortion, denial of service, social engineering and malware—to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, supply chain disruption or other threats that could compromise its IT resources, value chain coordination and overall firm performance.

Security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years, and these threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures; such attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future, and experienced computer programmers, hackers or employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise confidential information or create system disruptions or shutdowns. These attackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that exploit vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on third-party products and services, which themselves may experience breaches and attacks impacting our systems, and data security breaches may also result from non-technical means such as actions by an employee with system access. To defend against these security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may increase our expenses, and actual or perceived breaches or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data could expose us and affected parties to litigation, regulatory actions, damage to our brand and other harm to our business. Such disruptions may interrupt our ability to fulfill orders and other critical functions, potentially leading to delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers and materially affecting our financial results. Our worldwide operations could also be disrupted by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, cyber-attacks and other catastrophic events, any of which could require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations; catastrophic events can also impact third-party vendors who provide critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. We must continue to develop the infrastructure needed to appropriately scale our business, including customer service and customer support, and such efforts may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist in the design, simulation and verification of new products or enhancements and to bring them to market in a timely manner; however, we have experienced delays when available tools could not fully simulate complex features, and requirements to meet consumer demands may exceed these toolsâ€™ capabilities, which could cause us to miss design cycles, lose design wins, market share and revenues. Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data subject to privacy and security laws and regulations, and the theft, loss or misuse of such data could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings or disruption of our business; complying with these evolving laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs.

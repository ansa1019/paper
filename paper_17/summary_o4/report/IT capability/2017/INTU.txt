Our operations increasingly depend on the effective coordination and continuous enhancement of our information technology capabilities—ranging from our internal systems and software platforms to our network and data center infrastructure and third-party hosted environments—to support product development, online and mobile service delivery, transaction processing, customer support, marketing, sales, accounting and financial reporting. We devote significant resources to innovating and maintaining cloud-based and on-premises IT infrastructure, migrating applications to new data centers, upgrading systems for continuous availability, and integrating acquired technologies and data assets while preserving consistent controls, policies and procedures. The accelerating pace of technological change and the expansion of devices and platforms compel us to develop and deploy new products and features, adapt to changing customer needs, and retain and attract skilled software developers, data scientists and security professionals. We rely on commercially available and proprietary security technologies to safeguard large volumes of sensitive customer and employee data and have implemented multi-layered security and business controls to address privacy, cybersecurity and fraud risks, but we recognize that evolving threats, unauthorized access and system disruptions—whether from cyber-attacks, natural disasters, operational failures or third-party vendor lapses—could materially impair our systems, compromise data confidentiality, impede service availability and harm our competitive position and financial results. We also face ongoing challenges in integrating and amortizing acquired technology assets, in scaling transaction processing platforms to handle peak volumes, and in balancing the timing and accuracy of our software release cycles—particularly our tax preparation products—to meet regulatory changes, market expectations and internal performance metrics. In this context, our IT capability—encompassing technology infrastructure, information management, development practices, governance frameworks and personnel competencies—remains a critical strategic resource for sustaining competitive advantage, operational flexibility and value creation across our global business.

Netflix’s disclosures describe substantial investments in and reliance upon information technology capabilities to support its streaming business, including the development and refinement of its proprietary content delivery network (“Open Connect”), the deployment of third-party “cloud” computing services and Amazon Web Services to process, store and deliver high volumes of digital content, and the use of both proprietary and third-party technology for recommendation and merchandising algorithms, payment processing, user interface enhancements and operational systems. The company emphasizes that its ability to attract, retain and serve members depends on the reliable performance and security of its computer systems—whether hosted in-house or by web-hosting, cloud or network providers—while noting that any significant cyber-attack, system interruption, software error or failure by device and platform partners to update or interconnect with Netflix systems could degrade service, compromise member and corporate data, impair streaming functionality or diminish customer experience. Technology and development expenses, which comprise personnel, facilities, hardware and software costs, continue to grow as Netflix scales its service globally, improves streaming delivery infrastructure, enhances its feature set and adapts systems and operational practices to support original content production, international expansion and evolving business needs.

The Company relies extensively on information technology systems to conduct its global business, including networks and services such as internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms that are often managed, hosted or provided by third parties, in support of everything from order processing and financial reporting to customer service and intercompany transactions. It is in the process of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning system to replace many of its existing operating and financial systems, a major financial and managerial undertaking whose disruptions, delays or design deficiencies could impair its ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and support, send invoices, track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate effectively. The Company has invested in cybersecurity measures—including network and system monitoring, expert staffing, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers—to address numerous and evolving threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data, but it acknowledges that failures or breaches of its IT systems, networks or service providers, or inadequacies in its business continuity plans, could expose it to reputational, competitive, regulatory and legal harm.

Facebookâ€™s disclosures emphasize the critical role of its information and technical infrastructure in supporting its products and services, including investments in data centers, server equipment depreciation, network capacity and computing power, and technical infrastructure costs associated with content delivery, bandwidth and energy consumption, as well as ads payment processing; the company highlights its dependence on interoperability with mobile operating systems, networks, and standards it does not control and warns that changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems or in its own distribution channels could prevent rapid and reliable product delivery, diminish user experience, and harm engagement and monetization; Facebook further notes the importance of its ability to manage and prioritize information to present content that is appropriate, useful, and relevant to users, and to protect its data and user data through systems and processes designed to prevent data loss, unauthorized access, security breaches, and spam, while acknowledging the risk that third-party developers, partners or network providers may fail to adopt adequate data security practices; as part of its growth strategy, the company continues to increase headcount in engineering and technical functions, expand its connectivity, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality initiatives, and develop innovative advertising products and analytics solutions that leverage targeting capabilities and outcome-based measurement; in addition, research and development expenses principally reflect hiring software engineers and technical employees to build and improve existing products, while general and administrative investments include funding for content review, legal and compliance efforts under evolving privacy, data protection, and regulatory requirements governing the transfer, processing, and retention of user data.

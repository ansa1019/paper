The Company operates in a highly competitive environment in which the markets for its services are characterized by constant technological change, frequent introductions of new products and services and increasing client expectations, and accordingly emphasizes ongoing efforts to upgrade its technology, adapt its offerings to changes in technology and to develop and introduce innovative products and services that address increasingly sophisticated client needs. Its operations depend on complex technology resources, including internet and mobile banking systems, electronic payments processing products, card manufacturing and personalization infrastructure, software applications for account processing and bill payment, and networks and systems upon which services are delivered, which require significant investment in information security and controls to protect the integrity, continuity, security and confidentiality of sensitive data. A failure to prevent security breaches, cyber attacks, computer malware or operational failures, or to effectively install, integrate and maintain sophisticated software and technology on client systems, could disrupt service delivery and damage the Company’s reputation. The Company also must comply with evolving regulations relating to cybersecurity, data privacy and payment card industry standards, which may require substantial additional resources to modify existing products and controls or develop new solutions. The Company’s strategic initiatives include enhancing client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions, delivering innovation and integration across its technology portfolio to enable differentiated value and leveraging the integration of acquisitions such as Online Banking Solutions and Monitise to enrich digital offerings and transform its infrastructure. It anticipates that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in transaction processing, information management, regulatory compliance and digital channels, and expects to benefit from clients’ shift from in-house technology to outsourced, scale-driven solutions that facilitate customer interaction and drive operational efficiency.

The report underscores that the Company’s operational resilience and competitive positioning depend on its ability to “securely process, store, and transmit confidential and other information and assets” within its computer systems and networks and those of third-party providers, and on its capacity to “implement new security measures and systems, including the use of confidential intellectual property,” and to continuously “improve or upgrade” existing controls to address evolving threats.  It acknowledges that “major cyber incidents,” such as the 2017 Petya and WannaCry ransomware attacks, have increased the complexity of its security infrastructure, that “security events” ranging from unauthorized access, malware or other malicious code, catastrophic events, system failures, employee or third-party errors or malfeasance may not be immediately detected and could lead to “significant losses, reputational damage, or an adverse effect on our operations and critical business functions,” and that resolution of such events may require “significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities.”  The Company further observes that it uses “underwriting controls, risk models, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance” to manage insurance exposures but also leverages “various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) and data analytics” to “analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks” in underwriting, claims, reserving, and catastrophe risk, and that the outputs of these models are integral to decision making across its business.  In the governance arena, the Company details its compliance with the New York Department of Financial Services’ Cybersecurity Regulation—mandating a formal cybersecurity program with governance controls, risk-based minimum data security standards, incident-response and reporting requirements, vendor oversight, training, record-keeping and certification obligations—and notes the NAIC’s Insurance Data Security Model Law, as well as non-U.S. requirements such as the GDPR’s consent, notice, cross-border transfer and data-protection mandates and penalties of up to 4 percent of global annual revenue per violation.  It warns that if it “fails to comply with or obtain appropriate authorizations and/or exemptions” under these and similar laws, or if its systems or those of its vendors are disrupted, it “may be required to expend significant additional resources” and could face enforcement actions, fines, litigation, criminal prosecution, and an “adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.”

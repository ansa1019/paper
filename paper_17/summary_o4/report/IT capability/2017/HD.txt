In our risk factors, we disclose that a failure of a key information technology system or process could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; that we rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data; that we rely heavily on the integrity of, security of and consistent access to this data for information such as sales, customer data, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment; for these information technology systems and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must periodically maintain and update them, even as they remain subject to power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and cyber-attacks; that disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences; that through our information technology developments we provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices; that we use our websites and our mobile app both as sales channels for our products and as methods of providing inspiration and relevant information to drive both in-store and online sales; that we maintain multiple online communities and knowledge centers to inform, assist and interact with customers; and that we must continually enhance all of our online properties, as evidenced by our recent re-platform of HomeDepot.com. We further caution that the implementation of our store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives, including significant investments to build a One Home Depot supply chain designed to streamline operations, simplify customer interaction, improve our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network for home improvement products, relies on managing third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services and addressing impacts on inventory levels, and will require substantial investment in additional information technology personnel and other specialized personnel, with the risk that failure to choose, implement or scale these investments properly could disrupt operations and fail to provide anticipated benefits. Finally, we highlight that if our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information are not successful, our information systems and those of our third-party service providers and vendors—vulnerable to continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks, including unauthorized access through fraud or other means, hardware, software or application defects, and emerging methods to disable or degrade service—could be compromised, that we continuously review and update systems, processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access and prevent data loss, but with no guarantee of adequacy, and that a significant data breach could result in substantial costs to investigate and remediate, lost sales, fines, lawsuits and damage to our reputation, particularly as regulatory requirements for information security, data collection, use and privacy become increasingly rigorous.

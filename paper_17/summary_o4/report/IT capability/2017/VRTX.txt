We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business, and any disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and expose us to private and governmental liabilities. We are subject to a broad array of data privacy and protection laws and regulations governing the collection, transmission, storage and use of proprietary information and personally-identifying health information, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, federal consumer protection laws, federal HIPAA requirements, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and E.U. policies on publication of clinical trial data, and we have devoted significant resources to develop and maintain systems and processes—such as a corporate compliance program, specialized reporting systems pursuant to the U.S. Open Payments “Sunshine Act” and analogous U.S. and E.U. obligations—to support the accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access of our information, but failure to comply with these evolving requirements could result in enforcement actions, significant penalties, negative publicity and the need for further investment in our information management capabilities. We also face risks relating to social media platforms through which third parties communicate about our products and the diseases we treat, which creates uncertainty and the potential for reporting obligations, inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or inaccurate posts that may require enhanced monitoring systems and disaster recovery plans, and while we have implemented business continuity and security measures intended to mitigate such risks, there can be no assurance that they will prevent future breakdowns or breaches that could harm our business.

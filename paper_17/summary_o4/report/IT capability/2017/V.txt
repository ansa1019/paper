As described in our filings, innovations in payment technology have enabled the expansion into new products and services while broadening the potential scope of regulatory influence, and as a global payments technology company we operate an advanced transaction-processing network, VisaNet, which enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and supports a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Our network and processing infrastructure entails maintenance, equipment rental and third-party data-processing fees and may experience errors, interruptions, delays or service cessations in our information technology infrastructure and processing systems, which could disrupt operations, impair business continuity, expose sensitive data, trigger litigation or regulatory fines, and require significant additional resources to enhance security controls and remediate vulnerabilities. We acknowledge that failure to anticipate, adapt to or keep pace with rapid technological change—for example, mobile and proximity payment technologies, e-commerce, tokenization, crypto-currencies, new authentication methods including biometrics, and distributed ledger or blockchain technologies—or to integrate disparate systems following the Visa Europe acquisition, could impair our ability to compete, hinder future growth and adversely affect customer experience. We work closely with third parties, including potential competitors, to develop and gain access to new technologies, yet note that predicting which innovations will become widely adopted and how they may be regulated is difficult, and that some may be subject to intellectual property litigation requiring licensing. Cybersecurity threats—from power outages, telecommunication failures, viruses, malware, phishing and advanced cyber-attacks—pose risks to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data, and despite significant investments in cybersecurity programs and insurance, we cannot ensure our efforts will prevent or timely address such evolving threats. The integration of VisaNet and Visa Europe’s separate authorization, clearing and settlement systems is described as time-consuming, costly and technologically challenging; maintaining interoperability across territories is essential to prevent inconsistencies in payment processing services and products that could damage our brand and global perception. We continue to invest in technology assets and infrastructure to support digital solutions and core business initiatives, even as evolving regulatory oversight may impose new reporting, licensing, cybersecurity, processing infrastructure, capital or risk management requirements that could affect technology deployment and resource allocation across our global operations.

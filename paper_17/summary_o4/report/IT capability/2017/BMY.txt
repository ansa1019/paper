The company discloses that it is extensively dependent on information technology systems, networks and services—including Internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical platforms, some of which are managed by third parties—and that any significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of these critical IT systems or infrastructure by its workforce, authorized third parties or unauthorized persons could materially disrupt operations. It acknowledges that the ever-increasing evolution of digital technologies, such as cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in its or its third-party providers’ systems or portable media, and that it could suffer business interruption, data leakage or reputational harm from cyber-attacks, industrial espionage or malware. In response, the company has invested in industry-appropriate protections, monitoring practices and cyber insurance to reduce these risks and continuously monitors its systems for current and potential threats, although it concedes that such measures may not fully prevent or cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses resulting from a security breach. The company furthermore relies on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners and alliance partners to manage certain IT, marketing, selling, human resource, finance and other functional services and warns that the failure of these third parties to meet contractual, regulatory or business-continuity obligations, to deploy effective IT governance or to prevent cyber-events or other disruptions could have a material adverse impact on its operations. It also identifies the increasing complexity of new data privacy regulations and enforcement, particularly in the European Union and the United States, as well as the risk that inappropriate or unauthorized use of social media and other external digital channels may lead to non-public information leakage and brand damage.

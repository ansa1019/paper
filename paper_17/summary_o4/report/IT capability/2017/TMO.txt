Competitive factors cited in the report explicitly include technological innovation and e-business capabilities, and the company describes targeted investments in “commercial tools and infrastructure,” including the expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, to support cross-selling opportunities and enhance the customer experience.  In support of business strategies and work processes, the company periodically implements new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications as part of an ongoing effort to upgrade its information systems; it acknowledges that adding functionality may give rise to unanticipated problems that could disrupt its ability to provide quotes, process customer orders and otherwise run its business in a timely manner.  The company further relies on its technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell and ship products and services, bill and collect payments, track and support customers, fulfill contractual obligations and conduct other core operations.  It warns that its systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, cyber-attacks (including viruses, denial-of-service attacks and unauthorized access), data breaches and other security failures, any of which could result in service interruptions, loss of data or functionality, compromise of intellectual property or customer information, legal or regulatory liability and reputational harm, any of which could materially impair operations, financial performance and competitive position.

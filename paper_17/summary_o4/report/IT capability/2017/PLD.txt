Prologis discloses that our business and operations could suffer material disruptions from system failures or cyber security attacks despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems, and that our systems remain vulnerable to damages from energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures, computer viruses or unauthorized access; we further acknowledge challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different regions and monitor compliance with regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and that the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations; any compromise of our security could result in violations of privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, reputational damage, loss or misuse of information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, underscoring the need to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure information management capabilities—delivering data and information with requisite accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security and confidentiality—to support business continuity, compliance, operational efficiency and resilience.

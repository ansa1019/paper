The company has developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools administered by the chief financial officer to identify and evaluate operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks. Our customer-facing technology systems—including websites, mobile applications and digital platforms that support our omni-channel experience—must function as designed, provide a consistent customer experience and support ordering, project design, fulfillment and other operations; any failure of these systems to perform effectively or reliably, whether due to cyber-attacks, power outages, system errors or capacity constraints, could materially harm our reputation, drive customers away and lead to financial losses or potential liability. We continually invest in, maintain, improve, upgrade and expand our existing management information systems that support sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project execution, transportation, receipt processing, fulfillment and financial reporting, and we integrate financial, IT and other systems in connection with strategic transactions, which increases complexity in our internal controls and requires more integrated planning, initiative prioritization, program sequencing and new competencies among management, employees and contractors. We rely on a mix of internal IT resources and third-party service providers for functions such as authentication, content delivery, back-office support and payment processing, and in order to protect customer, employee, vendor and company information and comply with evolving data privacy and cybersecurity laws, we continually evaluate policies and processes, invest in information security and implement controls; however, we cannot guarantee that our systems or those of our service providers will not be breached, which could result in unauthorized access to, destruction, misuse or release of sensitive data and interruptions to our business operations. Maintaining the resilience, security, connectivity, access, accuracy, timeliness and confidentiality of our information systems and data, and mobilizing IT-based resources in combination with other strategic resources, is critical to supporting our business strategies, enhancing operational efficiency and effectively transforming the firm into a competitive force.

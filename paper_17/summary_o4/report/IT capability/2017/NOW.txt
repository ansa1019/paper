Our disclosures emphasize that our operations involve the storage, transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential, proprietary and sensitive information and that, as cyber-security threats develop and evolve, we may be required to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure since security breaches could disrupt our services, trigger indemnification and other contractual obligations and harm our competitive position. We acknowledge that the markets in which we compete have evolved rapidly and that cloud, mobile, workflow, consumer-product-like experiences, social collaboration, machine learning, artificial intelligence, internet-connected devices, robotic automation, security, cryptography, development tools and other digital technologies increasingly become the basis for customer purchases, requiring us to identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies, accurately predict our customers’ changing business needs, successfully deliver new platform technologies and products that meet these needs, efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments and effectively deliver business process planning, IT systems architecture planning and product implementation services. We further disclose that delays in the release of, or actual or perceived defects in, new or updated products may slow the adoption of our most recent technologies, reduce our ability to efficiently provide our services, decrease customer satisfaction, increase vulnerability to cyber attacks and adversely impact sales of additional products, and that various factors—including our customers’ integration, migration and security requirements or errors by us or our partners—may cause implementations of our products to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. We serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and co-located in third-party data-center facilities around the world, and data-center capacity costs, depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use and personnel-related costs directly associated with data-center operations and customer support constitute significant elements of our cost of subscription revenues. In our management’s discussion and analysis, we describe our enterprise cloud-computing solutions as defining, structuring, managing and automating services for global enterprises to improve service quality and reduce costs while scaling and automating business processes, and we note that we continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth, with an annual subscription-fee model that includes access to ordered subscription services and related support and updates during the subscription term, supplemented by professional services and training delivered by our internal organization and ecosystem of partners to support business innovation and competitive advantage.

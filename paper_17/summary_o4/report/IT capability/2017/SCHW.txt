While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, our operations are highly dependent on the integrity, resiliency, and timely enhancement of our technology systems and infrastructure, and security breaches of our systems—or those of our clients or third parties—may subject us to significant liability, regulatory actions, reputational damage, or loss of confidence in our controls. Security attacks, including cyber attacks, denial-of-service attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, and fraud, can originate from a wide variety of sources and evolve rapidly, and despite our advanced monitoring systems, internal authentication measures, employee training, and protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate or fully prevent all vulnerabilities, nor immediately determine the extent of a breach or how best to remediate it. System interruptions, errors, or downtime—due to changes in client use patterns, technological failure, system modifications, linkages with third-party systems, power failures, extraordinary trading volumes, or disruptions at exchanges and clearing houses—can significantly impact our ability to process, record, and settle client transactions, and it could take an extended period to restore full functionality. We rely on external service providers to perform key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions; any significant failures by them, and our inability to transition promptly to alternative arrangements, could disrupt our operations and result in less efficient service delivery. In recognition of these risks, we have established an enterprise-wide risk management framework that includes policies, controls, monitoring, routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and a dedicated information security program to protect client data and support our critical business functions.

Risk factors note difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining Nikeâ€™s increasingly complex information systems and controls, including the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control, and warn that interruptions in data and information technology systems and consumer data security could materially adversely affect operations. The company cautions that failures of the technology-based systems that give customers the ability to shop online through its e-commerce website, mobile commerce applications, social media channels and proprietary mobile applications could place Nike at a competitive disadvantage and materially harm global e-commerce growth. Nike emphasizes reliance on information technology systems and networks, including the internet and third-party hosted services, across its supply chain, product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution processes, as well as for processing financial information and compliance with regulatory reporting requirements, noting that any service interruption, security breach, virus, hacker attack or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment, reduced operational efficiency, reputational damage, lost revenues and significant remedial investments. The company reports that over a number of years it has implemented information technology systems in all geographic regions and that work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes is ongoing, with Nike continuing to invest in new technologies that increase automation, reduce waste and accelerate speed to market while expanding digital capabilities and consumer engagement tools. In addition, Nike discloses that it is subject to data security and privacy risks arising from the collection of transactional and personal information in its digital experiences, that increasingly sophisticated automated attacks threaten the loss or misappropriation of valuable business and personal data, and that misuse of or failure to secure confidential information could lead to fines, legal claims and adverse effects on reputation, market position and financial performance.

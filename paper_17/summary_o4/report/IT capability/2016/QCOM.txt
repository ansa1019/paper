We design, manufacture and market digital communications products and services based on cdma, ofdma and other technologies through our QCT segment, which develops integrated circuits and system software to enable device components to interface with our products and to support the convergence of computing and communications functionality, including Snapdragon processors, LTE modems, connectivity, graphics and multimedia codecs. QCT employs a fabless production model, relying on turnkey and two‐stage manufacturing arrangements with third‐party foundries and assembly and test service providers to procure raw materials, maintain manufacturing capacity and align production with shifting customer demand, and we continue to invest significant resources in 4G LTE and 5G technologies, OFDM‐based WLAN, RFFE, connectivity, mobile health, machine learning and adjacent industry segments such as automotive, IoT, smart cities and wearables to expand our technology portfolio and leverage our organizational capabilities to support business strategies, business process reconfiguration and interfirm transactions. Our QTL segment grants licenses to portions of our IP portfolio, including standard‐essential patents, to support licensees’ development and commercialization of network‐compliant devices, and recognizes license fees and royalties when reported, reflecting our ongoing efforts in IP governance, strategic resource allocation and market responsiveness. We also engage in strategic acquisitions and joint ventures—such as the RF360 joint venture with TDK to deliver RFFE modules and filters—and targeted investments in early‐stage companies to mobilize and deploy technology‐based resources, dynamically configure our technology infrastructure and create actionable options for future growth through process integration, data analytics and innovation partnerships. Our multifaceted investment portfolio is evaluated for market‐based performance and marked to market with impairment losses recognized when declines are other than temporary, ensuring operational flexibility, financial discipline and alignment of our capabilities with evolving market and regulatory contexts. To enhance execution and drive profitable growth, we implemented a strategic realignment plan including targeted cost reductions across R&D, SG&A and nonproduct cost of revenues, realigning organizational resources and internal processes in support of our competitive positioning and long‐term value creation for stockholders.

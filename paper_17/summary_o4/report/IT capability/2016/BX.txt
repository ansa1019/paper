Blackstone relies heavily on its financial, accounting, communications and other data‐processing systems, which face ongoing cybersecurity threats, tampering or network‐security breaches that could compromise proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage critical infrastructure. Although the firm has implemented measures to safeguard these systems, there can be no assurance that such measures will be fully effective. If its systems are compromised, fail to operate properly or become disabled, Blackstone could suffer financial loss, disruption of its businesses, liability to its investment funds and fund investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. The firm’s businesses are highly dependent on information systems and technology, and its information systems may not continue to accommodate growth or may entail increased maintenance costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect. In addition, Blackstone depends on its New York headquarters and related infrastructure for continued operations, and a disaster or disruption involving electronic communications or other services—whether at its site or those of third‐party providers—could impair its ability to conduct business without interruption; its disaster-recovery and business-continuity programs, and any related insurance, may be insufficient to mitigate the harm that may result. Finally, Blackstone’s reliance on third-party service providers for information systems, technology and fund administration could expose the firm to additional risk if those providers fail to perform or experience losses, failures or compromises of their own technology.

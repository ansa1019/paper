Visa’s operations are underpinned by an advanced transaction processing network that facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions, network access and other maintenance and support services, reflecting the firm’s evolving IT capability to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships. Innovations in payment technology—mobile and proximity acceptance, e-commerce, tokenization, crypto-currency, distributed ledger and blockchain—have broadened Visa’s digital technology portfolio and regulatory obligations, driving ongoing investments in technology assets, infrastructure capability, process automation and system upgrades to sustain connectivity, operational flexibility and competitive advantage. Central to Visa’s information management capability is the provision of data with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality and access, yet its own information security and processing systems, as well as those of clients and third-party providers, face risks from cyber-attacks, system failures, power outages, destructive software and other disruptions that could impair IT infrastructure, diminish transaction processing capacity, harm customer relationships and reputation and trigger litigation or regulatory enforcement. The integration of Visa Europe further highlights the criticality of ensuring interoperability of disparate authorization, clearing and settlement systems, aligning IT architecture and digital infrastructure to support global transaction volumes, optimize resource deployment and uphold innovation under shifting governance contexts.

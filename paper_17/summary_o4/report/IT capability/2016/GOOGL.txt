Google’s disclosures emphasize that its rapidly evolving, intensely competitive environment, driven by changing technologies and shifting user needs, requires continuous enhancement of its information technology capabilities. Management states that competing successfully “depends heavily on our ability to accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace rapidly,” and that the company must “continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use.” The firm expects to “continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices,” recognizing that “each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards” necessitating ongoing adaptation to ensure compatibility. It acknowledges that “our ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our current operations,” and that its “systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption” from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks or other security breaches. In response, Google “expects to continue to expend significant resources to create world-class security protections that shield against theft and security breaches” and conducts disaster recovery planning, while noting that “some of our systems are not fully redundant.” Financial disclosures detail substantial costs associated with data center operations—including depreciation, labor, energy, bandwidth and equipment—as well as significant capital expenditures in systems, data centers, real estate and information technology infrastructure. Research and development expenses are driven by “labor and facilities-related costs for employees responsible for R&D of our existing and new products and services,” equipment depreciation and professional services such as “information technology consulting and outsourcing services.” The risk factors further highlight data management and privacy concerns, warning that any “compromise of our security” or changes in data protection laws “could seriously harm our reputation and brand,” underscoring the importance of information management capabilities—accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security and confidentiality—in support of business strategies, customer relationships and firm performance.

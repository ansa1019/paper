We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business, collecting, storing and transmitting confidential information—including personal health data and intellectual property—that must be managed with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access; the size and complexity of these information technology and information security systems makes them potentially vulnerable to service interruptions, hardware or software malfunctions, security breaches or data-center failures, and any such disruption, infiltration or failure could subject us to liability, interrupt operations and require significant resources to remedy. We are subject to an expanding array of data privacy and protection laws and regulations—such as HIPAA, state breach-notification and health-information privacy laws, federal and state consumer-protection statutes, and evolving international requirements for the cross-border transfer of personal data (including the invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework and adoption of standard contractual clauses)—and failure to comply with these rules would expose us to enforcement actions by government authorities, significant civil monetary penalties and reputational harm. Under the Affordable Care Act’s Open Payments (“Sunshine Act”) and similar EU transparency initiatives, we must report annually to regulators detailed payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, obligating us to devote substantial resources to systems and processes that ensure full, accurate and timely compliance or face material penalties. The EMA’s new policy on publication of clinical reports raises the risk that third parties will review and analyze our raw trial data, potentially leading to confidentiality breaches, misinterpretations of clinical results or disclosure of competitively sensitive information. Finally, the increasing use of social media by patients and other stakeholders poses challenges for appropriately monitoring, capturing and responding to comments about product effectiveness or adverse events and for preventing inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information, thereby further underscoring the importance of robust information management capability, change-management practices and a comprehensive business-continuity plan to sustain operational flexibility, data integrity and regulatory compliance in a complex, digital business environment.

The company warns that its rapid growth and expanding end-customer deployments have placed “significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources” and require ongoing improvements to “our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.” It acknowledges the risk that it “may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner,” that “existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud,” and that it may encounter “difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements.” The company further cautions that failures in “systems related to order review and processing,” trade compliance requirements, logistics at quarter end or “technical failures and downtime” in its “data centers and networks” could disrupt revenue and impair its ability to distribute security updates, interoperate with customer infrastructures, and meet “more stringent requirements in our worldwide support and maintenance service contracts, including stricter support response times and penalties for any failure to meet support requirements.” These disclosures underscore the firm’s need to mobilize and integrate IT-based resources—ranging from infrastructure and software to processes and personnel—to coordinate its assets, internal processes, interfirm transactions, and relationships in support of its expanding business strategies and competitive positioning.

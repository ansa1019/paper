Bristol-Myers Squibb discloses that it is dependent on information technology and its systems and infrastructure face certain risks; the company relies extensively on IT systems, networks and services—including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, tools, technical applications and platforms—some of which are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties, and it also outsources certain business unit and functional services such as marketing, selling, human resources, finance and IT; the failure of any critical third party to meet its obligations—whether due to performance shortfalls, untimely delivery, unreliability or breaches of confidentiality—could have a material adverse impact on operations and results; breakdowns, invasions, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure by authorized or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations; the ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our or our third-party providers’ systems or portable media, and the company could experience business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise system infrastructure or lead to data leakage; increased use of social media further presents risks of brand damage, information leakage or unauthorized disclosure of non-public sensitive information; although the company has invested in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices for its data and IT and continues to monitor its systems, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future breakdowns or breaches.

Information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements, and if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be materially impaired. Our business requires us to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information, and we require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems while encryption and authentication technologies secure data transmission and storage; however, these security measures may be compromised as a result of security breaches by unauthorized persons, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularity, including phishing attempts, which could result in unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to hack into our products or systems to obtain personal data or our confidential or proprietary information, potentially creating safety risks, product functionality issues, product recalls or field activity. We have implemented programs to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and make ongoing improvements to minimize vulnerabilities in accordance with industry and regulatory standards, yet because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may not be able to anticipate and prevent these intrusions or mitigate them when they occur. In addition, we rely on external vendors to supply and support certain aspects of our information technology systems, and defects or quality or compliance problems in their systems could unexpectedly compromise our own information security.

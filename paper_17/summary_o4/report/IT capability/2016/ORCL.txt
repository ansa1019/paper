Oracle’s 10-K describes an IT capability that spans the coordination of application, platform and infrastructure components through a comprehensive and fully integrated stack of software, hardware and services delivered via cloud (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and on-premise deployment models.  The company emphasizes its competence to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure its IT resources—including database and middleware software, engineered systems, servers, storage, networking, virtualization and management tools—in support of evolving business strategies and customer needs, interlinking internal processes and interfirm transactions.  Oracle leverages technology, knowledge, management skills, process expertise and human resources to design cloud offerings that interoperate with one another and with on-premise environments via service-oriented architectures, clustered configurations and standards-based interfaces, delivering secure data isolation, flexible upgrades, self-service controls, high availability and enhanced operational flexibility.  Its hardware platforms are engineered to simplify deployment, management and maintenance of hybrid IT infrastructures, seamlessly connecting with existing third-party systems to improve performance and cost-efficiency.  Oracle further underscores its IT capability through continuous product development and integration of acquisitions, timely delivery of software updates, investment in security and reliability, and consulting and support services that together drive innovation, agility and competitive advantage in rapidly changing technology and market environments.

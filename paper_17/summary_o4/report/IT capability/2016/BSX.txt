We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our global day-to-day operations and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and to develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technologies, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns.  These systems underpin our remote monitoring of device performance and patient management services, which reflect our evolving digital health capabilities, and entail use of advanced mapping and navigation solutions in electrophysiology.  However, the size and complexity of our IT architecture expose us to cyber-attacks, malicious intrusion, system malfunctions and other breaches that could compromise data integrity, confidentiality and security, lead to unauthorized access to patient data or intellectual property, or otherwise disrupt operations and incur legal and regulatory penalties.  To mitigate these risks and to support integration of acquired businesses, we coordinate information technologies across our development, manufacturing, quality, regulatory and commercial functions, implement IT governance and control systems, and manage data in accordance with U.S. federal and state privacy and security laws, the European Data Protection Directive and General Data Protection Regulation and local data-localization requirements.  Any failure to adequately secure, support or scale our IT resources and information management capability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

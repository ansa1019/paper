Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time and may also require modifications to internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts and there can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and business disruption. In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency; however, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected. In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners, and the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking and phishing attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access, and our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information, subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers and partner with third-party providers for certain worker services, which may involve sharing limited worker information; however, if these third parties fail to adopt adequate data security practices or are breached, our workersâ€™ data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed, potentially causing liability and reputational harm. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems or to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition, competitive position and operating results. We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services, and we rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and manage transportation of our work-in-process and finished products as well as to provide certain information technology services, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these third-party providers will fulfill their responsibilities in a timely manner or that our contracts with them will be renewed, and any failure could materially adversely affect our internal operations and our ability to meet customer demand.

Coca-Cola’s operations rely upon robust information systems and associated networks to support procurement and supply‐chain management, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and payment collection, mergers and acquisitions, research and development, digital marketing activities and global electronic communications among its locations, bottling partners, customers, suppliers and consumers; these systems process financial information for internal reporting and regulatory compliance and underpin the company’s business continuity plans. Recognizing the criticality of mobilizing IT-based resources in combination with other organizational assets, the company has made ongoing investments in personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training and maintains an information-risk-management program supervised by IT management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee, with regular reports on emerging risks and mitigation strategies presented to senior management and the audit committee. The company cautions that service interruptions, system shutdowns or security breaches caused by hardware failures, malicious software, user error, insider actions, cyberattacks, geopolitical events, natural disasters or telecommunications outages could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, delays in financial reporting, lost revenue and profits due to an inability to manufacture or deliver products on time or to invoice and collect payments, as well as potential legal, regulatory and reputational damage—highlighting the importance of effective IT capability to coordinate internal processes, enhance operational flexibility, support strategic decision-making and maintain competitive advantage.

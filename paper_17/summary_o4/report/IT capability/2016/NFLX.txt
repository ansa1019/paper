As we scale our streaming service, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services, and have architected our software and computer systems to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by Amazon Web Services, on which we currently run the vast majority of our computing and cannot easily switch to another provider; we utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business, including the technology we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices, and we have built and deployed our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content over the internet; technology and development expenses consist of payroll and related costs incurred in making improvements to our service offerings, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendation, merchandising and streaming delivery technology and infrastructure, as well as costs associated with computer hardware and software; we also utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party web hosting provider, and we rely on multiple network providers and Internet Service Providers, which, if not properly interconnected with our CDN or if suboptimal, may impede our ability to deliver streaming content effectively; likewise, if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy or if our technology or that of third parties fails to operate as intended, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and attract new members may be impaired; any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks or physical break-ins, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data or theft of intellectual property, and any harm to our members’ personal computers or other devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect, and we have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems, recognizing that the reliable performance and security of these systems underpins our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members; if we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, or if the technology we use fails to meet expectations, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

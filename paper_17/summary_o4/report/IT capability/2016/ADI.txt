The company expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating each company’s respective businesses, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems and specifically recognizes the risk of “integrating personnel and IT systems from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services.” Throughout its operations the company relies on information technology systems to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and support critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email. Those information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. The company could also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break‐ins or hacking, sabotage or vandalism by third parties, and while confidentiality agreements are employed with strategic partners, breaches of the company’s or third parties’ systems could result in misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, with potentially significant financial or reputational damage.

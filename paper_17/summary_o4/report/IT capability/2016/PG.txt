The company discloses that it relies extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some managed by third parties—to execute core business processes such as ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, marketing and selling to consumers, collecting, transferring, storing and processing stakeholder information, summarizing and reporting results of operations, hosting and sharing proprietary research, facilitating global business communications, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, providing data security and supporting other processes necessary to manage the business. The company acknowledges that numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose risks to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data and critical business operations and that an incident or failure of key IT systems, networks, hardware, processes, sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on its business or reputation, giving rise to significant remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action. In response, the company continually assesses potential threats and makes targeted investments—such as network and system monitoring, skills upgrades, employee training and enhanced security policies—for itself and its third-party providers. Complementing these operational disclosures, the Management’s Discussion describes the role of Global Business Services in providing technology, processes and standardized data tools to enable business units and market operations to better understand and serve consumers and customers with world-class, cost-effective solutions and minimal capital investment, highlighting the firm’s coordination and deployment of IT resources to support and enhance its strategic objectives, risk management and business continuity.

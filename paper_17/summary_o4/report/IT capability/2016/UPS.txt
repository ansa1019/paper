The company discloses that it relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, and that its franchised center locations are likewise dependent on IT systems to run their operations. It cautions that its information technology systems (as well as those of its franchisees), some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to software upgrades or replacements, power outages, hardware failures, database incidents, cyber-attacks, malicious insiders, telecommunications failures, user errors or catastrophic events, and that breaches in security could expose proprietary and sensitive or confidential data and require substantial incremental spending on data and system security. In its management’s discussion and analysis, it highlights several initiatives to improve flexibility, capacity, yield management, operational efficiency and cost containment, most notably the continued deployment of technology improvements—including facility automation projects and the accelerated roll-out of its on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“Orion”)—which have increased network capacity, operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability, contained the growth of average daily vehicle miles driven despite volume increases, and supported productivity through more effective package sorting and delivery. The company further identifies information technology as a material category of its capital expenditures and applies activity-based costing methods enabled by IT to allocate operating expenses across its reporting segments.

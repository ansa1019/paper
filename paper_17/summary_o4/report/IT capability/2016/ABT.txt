Abbott’s global operations depend on sophisticated information technology systems for both its infrastructure and products, with the size and complexity of these systems making them susceptible to cyber attacks, malicious intrusion, breakdowns, data privacy breaches or other significant disruptions. To mitigate these risks and support critical business processes, Abbott invests in its systems and technology—including enhancing data and product protection measures—and continuously monitors its systems for current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. Despite these investments and ongoing monitoring efforts, there can be no assurance that future attacks or disruptions will be prevented, and any significant breach could result in increased costs, impaired product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties. Capital expenditures routinely include investments in information technology to upgrade and expand manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment, as well as laboratory instruments placed with customers.

Nee and FPL are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems and network infrastructure, whose continuous functioning is critical and challenging to their ability to process and monitor a very large number of highly complex transactions across diverse markets. Despite implementation of security measures, all of their technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access, and if those systems were to fail or be breached, sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, the companies could be unable to fulfill critical business functions and generate, purchase or transmit power, bill customers or collect and process payments, and their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. The companies regularly add, modify and replace information systems, and modifying existing systems or implementing new or replacement systems is costly and involves risks, including integrating the modified, new or replacement system with existing systems and processes, implementing associated changes in accounting procedures and controls and ensuring that data conversion is accurate and consistent; any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems or in the modification or implementation of new systems could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, diversion of management’s and employees’ attention and resources and negative impacts on the effectiveness of their control environment and their ability to timely file required regulatory reports. Threats of cyber attacks on energy infrastructure such as substations, gas pipelines and related assets and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups could target the companies’ generation, transmission and distribution facilities, fuel storage facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure, harm their operations, limit service restoration, diminish customer confidence, expose customer information to identity theft, result in fines and legal claims and impair their ability to raise capital or recover costs.

The annual report repeatedly emphasizes that information technology and cybersecurity form a core component of its capabilities and service offerings. In its Business Overview, the company states that it “provides a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services” and that its “main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.” The report further describes the strategic divestiture of its Information Systems & Global Solutions business as an effort to sharpen management focus and resource allocation around its remaining IT products and services. In its risk disclosures, the company warns that “we routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our company sensitive information, denial-of-service attacks, threats to the security of our facilities and employees,” and that similar threats may occur at customer sites they “operate and manage.” It cautions that “if we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures,” and that “we must rely on the safeguards put in place by” suppliers, subcontractors and venture partners, who “have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards.” The report also notes that “the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means” and that such events “could result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or other intellectual property; early obsolescence of our products and services; or contractual penalties,” underscoring the vital role of IT infrastructure, information security, connectivity and resilience in supporting its operations, competitive positioning and customer relationships.

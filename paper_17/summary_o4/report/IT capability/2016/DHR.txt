The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize that it relies extensively on information technology systems—some managed by third parties—to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential business information and personally identifiable data, and to manage or support critical business processes and remote‐monitoring products and services that incorporate software and IT functions.  These systems are subject to damage, disruption or shutdown from cyber‐attacks, viruses, unauthorized access, employee error or malfeasance, power or hardware failures, telecommunication outages, natural disasters or other unforeseen events, and the Company’s disaster‐recovery planning may prove ineffective or inadequate.  Security breaches of the Company’s IT systems or those of its suppliers and partners could result in misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personal data, theft of intellectual property, defective products or services, operational interruptions, production and shipment delays, damage to customer relationships and reputation, litigation, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, civil and criminal penalties under privacy and data‐security laws (including HIPAA, state breach notification statutes and the EU General Data Protection Regulation), and increased costs for security and remediation.  As a global organization, the Company must maintain reliable IT systems and appropriate controls to comply with diverse data privacy and security requirements, including data‐localization and transfer‐restriction laws in China, Russia and other jurisdictions; failure to do so may give rise to fines, reputational harm and business interruption.  The Company continues to allocate capital expenditures to improve information technology systems that support new product development, operational efficiency, customer‐facing resources and global manufacturing, research and development capabilities.

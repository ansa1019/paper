Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal and hosted information technology systems, the company acknowledges that its systems remain vulnerable to damages or interruptions from energy blackouts, natural disasters, telecommunications failures and cyber‚Äêsecurity attacks, any of which could disrupt operations, incur significant legal and financial exposure, damage reputation and result in additional costs to remedy; to support and enhance its business strategies and processes, the company has invested in a variety of technologies and advanced data analysis tools that have enabled it to integrate newly acquired real estate assets and streamline property management and leasing functions with only minimal increases in general and administrative expenses, thereby mobilizing IT-based resources to achieve operational efficiencies and more effective decision making across its growing global portfolio.

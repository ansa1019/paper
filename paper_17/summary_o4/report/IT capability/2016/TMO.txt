The report highlights “e-business capabilities” among the competitive factors the company must develop to remain competitive and describes strategic growth investments in “commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities,” including the expansion of “e-commerce platforms” and enterprise resource planning software. It discloses an ongoing effort to upgrade its information systems and periodically implement new ERP and other software applications to manage quotes, customer orders, billing, collections, supplier interactions, shipping, service delivery, customer tracking and contract fulfillment, while warning that such system changes may give rise to unforeseen problems that disrupt its ability to run the business in a timely manner, cause interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality and, if new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data, adversely affect operating results and cash flows. The company also acknowledges its reliance on technology infrastructure to support a broad range of operations and cautions that its systems may be vulnerable to natural disasters, power interruptions, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks (including denial-of-service attacks), computer viruses, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or trade secrets and other security breaches, noting that certain systems lack full redundancy and disaster recovery planning may be insufficient for every eventuality. Accordingly, it identifies a significant disruption or breach of its information technology systems as a material risk that could interrupt its operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property, damage customer and partner relationships and its reputation, expose it to legal claims and privacy-law penalties, increase security and remediation costs and otherwise adversely affect its business and financial results.

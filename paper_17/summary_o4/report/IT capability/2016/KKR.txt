KKR’s businesses depend critically on its financial, accounting and other data‐processing systems and on the information systems and technology platforms of third‐party service providers to support firmwide transaction execution, confirmation, settlement and performance monitoring in a time‐sensitive, efficient and accurate manner across markets and geographies. At its core, KKR’s operating model relies on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and proprietary data via its internal computer networks and hosted solutions, the integration of those IT capabilities with new products and investment strategies, and the coordination of its funds’ portfolio analytics and capital markets activities. The firm acknowledges that an inability of its or its vendors’ systems to accommodate growth, adapt to evolving business needs or withstand security threats—including cyber attacks, unauthorized access, malware, fraudulent emails or other malicious exploits—could lead to financial loss, business disruption, regulatory intervention or reputational damage, and that its business‐continuity and disaster‐recovery programs, as well as its insurance arrangements, may not fully mitigate those risks, especially if the cost of maintaining and scaling these critical technology infrastructures increases beyond current levels.

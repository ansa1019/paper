Cisco designs and sells broad lines of products, provides services and delivers integrated solutions to develop and connect networks globally; for over thirty years, the company has helped customers build networks and automate, orchestrate, integrate and digitize IT-based products and services. Over time, Cisco has expanded into new markets as the network has become the platform for delivering an ever-increasing portfolio of IT-based products and services, and has made strategic investments, architectural changes, and organizational transformations to enable the network to serve as the foundation for automating, orchestrating and integrating IT resource deployment, data distribution and business process management. Several years ago, Cisco launched its Unified Computing System, a next-generation enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing, network, storage access and virtualization resources in a single system to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center. Ciscoâ€™s strategy is to lead customers in their digital transition with pervasive, industry-leading security and intelligent connectivity across nearly everything that can be digitally connected, providing secure, automated and intelligent solutions built on infrastructure that aggregates and analyzes distributed data across customer premises, the network edge and the cloud. To deliver on this strategy, Cisco has realigned and dedicated resources into key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center, cloud and software while also maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services, and continues to evolve its organizational structure and delivery models to support software-based offerings, subscription revenue models, strategic alliances and programmable and virtualized networks, including software-defined networking and cloud-led architectures. The company recognizes that success in this dynamic environment depends on its ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology resources and capabilities; to integrate hardware, software, management skills and business process understanding; to anticipate and respond to emerging technological trends; and to develop and introduce new products and services in existing and emerging markets on a timely basis.

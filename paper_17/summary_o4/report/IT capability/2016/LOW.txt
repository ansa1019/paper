Lowe’s disclosures emphasize the evolving importance of IT capability in its omni-channel sales and marketing strategy and risk management framework, noting the deployment of analytics, periodic surveys, planning processes, risk mapping and other tools to identify and evaluate operational, financial, environmental, reputational and strategic risks. The company’s customer-facing technology systems, including lowes.com, lowesforpros.com, affiliated websites, mobile apps and in-home selling platforms, are required to appeal to customers, function reliably and deliver a consistent experience across channels, and Lowe’s relies on third-party service providers for authentication, content delivery, back-office support and payment processing for a variety of electronic payment methods subject to data security rules, electronic funds transfer regulations and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. Performance issues, temporary outages, distributed denial-of-service or ransomware attacks or complete system failures without rapid disaster recovery could destroy customer confidence and impair Lowe’s reliability as an online vendor and information source, and the failure to protect sensitive customer, employee, vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations could have a material adverse effect on reputation, operations and financial results. An important part of delivering the omni-channel experience is ongoing investment in, maintenance of and improvements to management information systems that support operations such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment; these systems are subject to potential damage or interruption from catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks and telecommunications failures, and improving information accuracy, timeliness, connectivity, security, confidentiality and access is critical to support business needs and strategic initiatives which demand integrated planning, initiative prioritization, program sequencing and enhanced management and technical skills.

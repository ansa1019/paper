Our cable communications business makes clear that our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and we continue to invest in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity, including DOCSIS 3.1, X1 set-top boxes, cloud DVR technology and wireless gateways, as well as expanding our network of residential and outdoor Wi-Fi hotspots to improve connectivity and customer experience; however, failure to choose technologies that are as effective or attractive to consumers, to employ technologies desired by consumers before our competitors or to execute effectively on our technology initiatives could have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. While adapting to changing consumer behaviors—for example, by deploying our X1 platform, cloud DVR technology and apps such as Netflix on our X1 set-top boxes—new and traditional competitors continue to launch subscription video-on-demand services, live online broadcast and cable television streaming services and downloading services that can be viewed on a variety of devices, which underscores the need to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new technologies continually. We also seek to enhance the value of our network by growing our high-speed internet and business services and by launching additional services such as home security and automation, while continuing to incur substantial costs as we develop and deploy various technology and software tools and hire additional personnel to improve the customer experience. Our network and information systems, including those related to network management, customer service operations and programming delivery, are critical to our business activities and subject to cyber attacks, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks and other malicious activities or disruptions, any of which could degrade or disrupt our services, damage our equipment, data and reputation, and require significant capital expenditures to repair or protect these systems; accordingly, we maintain a comprehensive security program and obtain assurances from third parties that handle confidential information, but security breaches such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage or accidental release of data could damage our reputation and expose us to regulatory fines. Furthermore, we depend on third-party vendors for hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain services, and if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or fail to meet our specifications or delivery schedules at reasonable prices, our ability to provide services to our customers may be adversely affected.

The annual report repeatedly underscores our dependence on a robust and scalable information‐technology infrastructure to coordinate the firm’s assets, internal processes, interfirm transactions and relationships, including the operation of data centers and network infrastructure—facility and server equipment, depreciation, energy and bandwidth costs—and the interoperability of Facebook and related products with mobile operating systems, networks and standards we do not control. We recognize advertising revenue through complex ad‐serving and measurement systems that rely on algorithmic processes to deliver impressions, clicks or actions with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability and connectivity, and we continually evolve our methodology to optimize ad placement, performance gains and analytics while mitigating risks such as ad blockers or changes in third‐party policies. Substantial R&D investments—salaries, benefits and share‐based compensation for engineering and technical teams—are expended to build, improve and integrate new products, from news feed innovations to virtual reality and artificial intelligence initiatives, and to maintain system security, data confidentiality and protection against malware, phishing and other breaches. Our business model further depends on the deployment of IT resources to support developer APIs, third‐party content integration and payments processing, in which network reliability, transaction accuracy, and compliance with regulatory and privacy requirements are critical. We allocate resources and assess fair values of acquired technology, trade names and user bases through rigorous valuation models, monitor evolving digital infrastructures and competitive pressures, and continually reconfigure IT architecture, governance practices and strategic resource allocations to sustain operational efficiency, support business strategy alignment and enhance our competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment.

The Company discloses that its information systems, which are used to manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and facilitate internal and external communications with employees, suppliers, customers and others, are critical to its operations and that failure of these systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data. Some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers, and although the Company maintains backup systems, business continuity plans and implements measures to protect systems and data from unauthorized access, any system outage or security breach could materially impair operational efficiency, competitive positioning and reputational standing and could require significant remediation and other costs.

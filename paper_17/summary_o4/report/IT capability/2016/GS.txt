In addition, our business activities are increasingly subject to laws and regulations on surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring, which may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security, potentially making us more vulnerable to cyber attacks, misappropriation, corruption or loss of information or technology; our operational systems, infrastructure and those of third parties, as well as human error, are critical to our ability to process and monitor daily high-volume, complex transactions across numerous markets and may fail or become disabled due to events such as spikes in transaction volume, causing liquidity impairment, business disruption, erroneous disclosures, damage to our reputation and financial loss; we must continuously update these systems and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to support growth, integrate new businesses, respond to regulatory and market changes, ensure compliance with client-specific guidelines and global reporting requirements, and mitigate risks of implementation and integration; developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure has become more challenging as we expand our client base, geographical reach, and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of electronic transactions, and as reporting requirements increase, heightening the risk of systems or human error with potentially significant consequences; we face risks of operational failure or capacity constraints at clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries, and as our interconnectivity grows, a failure in clients’ systems could impair our ability to effect transactions, manage risk and service clients, resulting in financial loss, impaired liquidity, disruption of our businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage; despite advanced technology-based risk and control systems, our operations ultimately depend on people and may experience processing errors, and the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems mean that enhancements may themselves create disruption and security issues; despite our resiliency plans, disruptions to supporting infrastructure—including electrical, communications, internet, cloud services and transportation—could prevent us from occupying offices or communicating among locations, impairing our ability to implement contingency plans; a failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information against cyber attacks could jeopardize confidential and other information, impair our operations and cause losses, reputational damage and legal liability; we are regularly the target of cyber attacks, including denial-of-service attempts, and must continuously monitor and develop our technology infrastructure and data protection measures as the techniques become increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and often elude detection; as we expand mobile- and internet-based products and cloud technologies, and as we interact with more retail clients and third-party vendors, these risks escalate and we remain vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, viruses and malicious code, while encryption and other protective measures may be defeated by advancing computing power; and we routinely transmit personal, confidential and proprietary information electronically, but cannot ensure secure capabilities with all third parties, leaving us at risk of interception, mishandling or misuse that could result in client or regulatory claims and reputational harm.

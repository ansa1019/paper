Our filings disclose that our rapid growth has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure and compelled us to manage an increasingly large and complex array of internal systems and processes—spanning hardware and software development, contract manufacturing and purchasing, logistics and fulfillment, and maintenance and support—to coordinate our assets and scale our operations.  We have identified the need to strengthen our operational, financial and management controls, reporting processes and procedures and to implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems in order to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel.  We acknowledge that we may not be able to implement these improvements to our systems and processes efficiently or in a timely manner, that we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness, and that we may experience difficulties in connection with third-party technology; in addition, our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud.  Our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate effectively and as intended, could disrupt current operations and end-customer relationships, hinder our ability to manage future growth and accurately forecast revenue, expenses and earnings, and expose us to losses.  We further recognize that developing new technology is complex and uncertain, requires significant upfront investment that may not yield design improvements, cost savings or marketable new products, and that our highly complex products—which incorporate advanced hardware and software technologies—may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.  Such defects or errors could impact product performance, delay development or releases of new products or versions, and, if we fail to devote sufficient resources to ensure interoperability with third-party operating systems, software applications and hardware, could weaken demand for our products.  Ultimately, our business depends on sustained demand for information technology, network connectivity and access to data and applications and on our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of our strategies, internal processes and interfirm transactions and relationships.

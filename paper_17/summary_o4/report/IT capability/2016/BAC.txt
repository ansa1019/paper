The report emphasizes that our operational and security systems and infrastructure—including our computer systems, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties—are integral to performance and require continuous updating to support growth and maintain compliance with evolving laws, rules and regulations. It warns that large-scale strategic technology project implementation challenges may cause business interruptions and that our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards is more limited with respect to third-party systems. The firm relies on internet and mobile banking channel strategies and is developing additional remote-connectivity solutions to serve customers “when and how they want to be served,” acknowledging that customers and third parties may access our network through personal devices outside our environment. The report notes that cyberattacks, information or security breaches, or technology failures could disrupt business, erode customer confidence and incur significant remediation and compliance costs, and stresses that cybersecurity and the enhancement of controls, processes and practices to protect systems, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority.

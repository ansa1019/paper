Our risk disclosures emphasize that our operating results and reputation could be materially harmed by breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems—whether from computer viruses, system failures, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism—which could compromise our IT networks; result in lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; disrupt manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of employee personal data; or require increased information technology protection costs. We further acknowledge exposure to possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks across more than 30 countries in which we operate, and we recognize that breaches of our suppliers’ information technology systems could similarly lead to unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information. Our risk factors also note that breaches of customer information technology systems may interrupt customer operations, and we remain subject to complex data privacy and protection laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. In our go-to-market model, we leverage digital infrastructure and our web presence—together with a global sales force—to provide secure, reliable connectivity and real-time information access for approximately 100,000 customers worldwide, reflecting our focus on mobilizing IT-based resources to support and enhance business strategies and processes.

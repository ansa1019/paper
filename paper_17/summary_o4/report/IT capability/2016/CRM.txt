The Company discloses that its IT capability depends on security measures at its third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and service partners and that if those measures are breached unauthorized access to customer data, the Company’s data or its IT systems could occur, potentially exposing proprietary and sensitive financial and personally identifiable information, subjecting the Company to legal and financial liabilities and damaging its reputation. Although the Company has security measures in place, they may be circumvented by hackers, employee error or malfeasance or by fraudulent inducements of credentials, and because techniques to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and are generally not recognized until they strike a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate preventative measures; likewise, customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their data without adequate security controls, and the Company cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. The Company’s services, which involve the storage and transmission of customer data, incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software that may contain errors or defects resulting in unanticipated downtime, and customers may use services in unanticipated ways that disrupt access for other users. As the Company acquires businesses and technologies it may encounter difficulty incorporating acquired technologies into its services and augmenting them to meet quality and security standards. Interruptions or delays in services from third-party hosting facilities or cloud platform providers could impair service delivery, reduce revenue, cause customer attrition or regulatory penalties, and harm the Company’s business; to mitigate such risks, production environments and customer data are replicated in near real time to separate disaster recovery and business continuity facilities, which nonetheless remain vulnerable to natural disasters, sabotage, administrative actions, changes in legal or permitting requirements and litigation. The Company relies on hardware, licensed and proprietary software and cloud computing platforms from multiple vendors, and any loss of rights to use such infrastructure, or inability to accurately plan for capacity requirements, could significantly increase expenses, cause service degradation or outages and delay provisioning of services pending development or integration of equivalent technology. Moreover, because delivery of the Company’s services depends on a fragmented, distributed Internet infrastructure controlled by independent third parties under ICANN governance, damage to portions of that infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks or cyber incidents could cause outages or fragmentation of the Internet beyond the Company’s control. The Company must also comply with evolving privacy laws, cross-border data transfer restrictions, self-regulatory certification standards and industry-specific regulations governing the use of cloud computing and outsourced services, the failure to satisfy which could limit service adoption or restrict global offerings. Finally, the intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented market for enterprise applications and platform services, characterized by shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products, compels the Company to make ongoing investments and acquisitions of complementary services, technologies and intellectual property and to integrate operations, platforms and personnel effectively, while maintaining brand, security and quality standards in order to preserve its competitive IT capability.

Gilead discloses that its global operations are highly dependent on complex information technology systems, infrastructure and data to support manufacturing, safety reporting, promotional activities, clinical trials, regulatory submissions, supply chain management and other internal business processes; these systemsâ€™ complexity and interconnectedness create vulnerabilities to service interruptions, destruction, malicious intrusion, cyberattacks, data privacy and security breaches that could expose proprietary information, trade secrets or personal data of employees, patients, customers or partners, disrupt its processes or impair its ability to comply with regulations, and that despite ongoing investments in data protection and information systems, insurance may not fully cover losses from such events, which could materially harm its business, reputation and financial condition.

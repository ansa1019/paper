Amgen’s 2016 Form 10‐K describes a broad transformation and process improvement program designed to modernize its operating model, reallocate resources toward its innovative pipeline and growth opportunities, and drive manufacturing efficiencies, reflecting an expanded scope of capabilities required to coordinate assets, internal processes and external relationships.  The filing explicitly recognizes that the company is increasingly dependent on its information technology systems, infrastructure, network-connected control systems and data security, noting that “the breadth, complexity and business process integration of our computer systems and the potential value of our data make these systems targets of service interruption, destruction, malicious intrusion and attack.”  While past cyber-attacks and intrusions have not, to date, had a material adverse effect on operations, Amgen states that it continues to invest in the protection and monitoring of its critical or sensitive data and IT assets, yet acknowledges there can be no assurance that these efforts will fully prevent service interruptions, undetected security breaches or loss of essential information that could adversely affect its business and operations.

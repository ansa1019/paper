Boeing discloses that its business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, and that any significant production delays or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of its data, information systems or networks could impact its sales, increase its expenses and/or have an adverse effect on its reputation and that of its products and services. Unauthorized access to Boeing’s or its customers’ information and systems, or the release or corruption of confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, could negatively impact the company’s financial performance and reputation. To address these risks, the company maintains an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in its systems. In addition, Boeing manages information and information technology systems for certain customers, many of whom face similar security threats. While not described as a discrete “IT capability,” Boeing’s continual efforts to coordinate its global network of suppliers and partners, identify and implement productivity improvements, optimize inventory management and improve efficiency and quality across its complex production system implicitly reflect its mobilization and deployment of technology, data and process controls in support of its operational and strategic goals.

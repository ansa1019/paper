In our Form 10-K we disclose that system security and data protection breaches and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated, may penetrate our security controls to misappropriate or compromise confidential information, create system disruptions or shutdowns, and disrupt critical business functions; for portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on third-party providers whose own breaches could impact our systems; data security incidents, whether technical or arising from employee actions, may lead to loss or unauthorized dissemination of sensitive or proprietary data, litigation, liability, reputation damage and increased expenses, and our efforts to prevent or overcome these challenges may not be successful and could increase costs, delay order fulfillment and cause customer attrition; we also depend on the availability and resilience of cloud service providers and principal IT datacenters—particularly those in California—making us vulnerable to natural or man-made disruptions that could require substantial recovery expenditures and time; we rely on third-party software development tools for design, simulation and verification of new product features, and the inability of these tools to fully support our complex functionalities can delay product introductions, result in design-cycle misses, diminish design-wins and erode market share; unanticipated shifts in industry standards may render our products incompatible with major hardware and software environments; in our management’s discussion of operations we highlight vertical integration of hardware, system software, programmable algorithms, libraries, systems and services to create unique value across PC, mobile, cloud and AI platforms; our GPU-based Pascal architecture, TensorRT deep learning inferencing framework, DGX-1 supercomputers and DRIVE PX2 self-driving platforms reflect significant investments in technology infrastructure, data processing capacity, connectivity, information management and AI frameworks; collaborative partnerships with Microsoft Azure, research agencies and high-definition mapping providers underscore our mobilization of IT-based resources with other capabilities to support deep learning, data science, real-time mapping and over-the-air software updates; our license and development revenue arrangements often require significant customization and are recognized over time based on cost-to-completion, evidencing coordination of intellectual property assets with ongoing service deliverables; and our substantial R&D expenditures, ongoing contractual commitments for critical software tools and lease-financing of IT-enabled facilities illustrate our strategic allocation of technology resources, support capacity and organizational competence to meet evolving business needs and competitive market dynamics.

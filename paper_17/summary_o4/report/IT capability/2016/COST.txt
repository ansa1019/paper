The Companyâ€™s ongoing multi-year modernization of its information systems, including increased depreciation, service contract and central operating costs recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses, continues to expand the coordination of financial and operational resources across its U.S., Canadian and other international operations; as part of this effort, accelerated vendor payments were made in the last week of fiscal 2016 in preparation for deployment of a new accounting system, and capital expenditure plans for 2017 include further investments in information systems infrastructure; in addition, the Company transitioned to a Citibank-Visa co-branded credit card program in June 2016 and manages credit and debit card receivables through electronic processing platforms, while sophisticated revenue recognition and inventory valuation methodologies leverage electronic data management and real-time retail inventory methods to support timely, accurate financial reporting, risk management of foreign-currency forward contracts and overall operational efficiency.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit certain information from individuals, such as customer payment card and check information, relying in part on commercially available systems, software, hardware, services, tools and monitoring to provide security for collection, storage, processing and transmission of personal and/or confidential information; we rely extensively on various information systems, including data centers, telecommunications systems, hardware and software applications to manage many aspects of our business—from processing and recording transactions in our stores and enabling effective communication systems to sourcing, planning and tracking inventory, managing logistics, generating performance and financial reports, complying with regulatory requirements and operating our e-commerce sites—and we depend on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems; supporting these internal and external systems requires effective, qualified and in some cases specialized teams whom we must continue to hire, train, manage and retain, including those needed to support our customized and legacy systems in an effective way; our information systems, and the third-party systems we rely on, are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, system failures, computer viruses or malware, security breaches, cyber-attacks, catastrophic events, acts of war or terrorism, design or usage errors by our associates, contractors or third-party service providers and other causes; while we have taken steps to further strengthen the security of our computer systems since the unauthorized intrusion into our network discovered late in 2006, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data security compromise, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to the information we collect, store, process or transmit or otherwise interfere with our systems, or that any such compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely way; although we seek to maintain our systems effectively, manage our teams and successfully address the risk of compromises of the integrity, security and consistent operations of our systems, our approach to disaster recovery may not be adequate and any compromises, interruptions or shutdowns—intentional or inadvertent—of our systems, including those managed by third parties, could lead to delays in our business operations, reputational harm or loss of sales; we modify, update and replace our systems and infrastructure by adding new hardware, software and applications, maintaining, updating or replacing legacy programs, converting to global systems, integrating new service providers, adding enhanced or new functionality—such as for cloud-computing technologies—and integrating new systems when we acquire businesses, as well as changing vendors and internal teams who assist us with designing, implementing and maintaining our systems; despite diligence in selecting systems, teams and vendors and implementing procedures to maintain system integrity when implementing, modifying or replacing systems, there are inherent risks associated with these activities that could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability.

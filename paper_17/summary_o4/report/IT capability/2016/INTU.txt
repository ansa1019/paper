Intuit expects to continue investing significant management attention and resources in its information technology infrastructure and in its privacy and security capabilities, reflecting a strategic shift toward connected services and cloud-based platforms. As it updates customer-facing applications and supporting IT infrastructure—migrating applications to new data centers and third-party hosted environments—Intuit acknowledges that many critical applications still reside in single data centers and that shortcomings in redundancy or disaster-recovery planning may impair service availability. The Company’s ongoing efforts to upgrade and expand network security, high-availability capabilities, and information systems are designed to limit vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks, natural disasters, and equipment failures, while protecting large volumes of sensitive customer and employee data through commercially available security technologies and business controls. Intuit also relies on internal and external systems maintained by partners, including cloud service providers, manufacturers, and distributors, to process customer orders and support online operations, making robust IT governance, resilience, and infrastructure capability critical to enabling continual service availability, regulatory compliance, and competitive advantage.

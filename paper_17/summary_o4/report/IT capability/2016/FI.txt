We emphasize the critical importance of continuously upgrading and adapting our technology platforms—including account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, and internet, mobile and tablet banking (“digital channels”)—to meet evolving client needs and remain competitive, warning that failure to adapt our products and services to technological or market changes, or to successfully develop, introduce and market innovative, high-quality, secure and reliable technology-based solutions, could impair client acquisition, retention, market acceptance and growth. We note that future growth in electronic transactions will be driven by speed, cost, ease-of-use, security, connectivity and service quality, which in turn necessitates ongoing investments in information security and controls, business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities to safeguard data integrity, confidentiality and access, and that security breaches or operational failures could disrupt processing, erode client trust and require significant additional resources to enhance our information management capabilities. Our management discussion highlights strategic initiatives to differentiate our products and services through innovation, active portfolio management, enhanced digital and payments solutions, operational effectiveness and disciplined capital allocation, and we expect financial institutions to continue outsourcing technology to benefit from economies of scale in building and maintaining the infrastructure, technology portfolio and networks required to process growing transaction volumes, manage increasing data needs, comply with regulations and offer new services, thus creating substantial revenue opportunities for our integrated technology and services solutions.

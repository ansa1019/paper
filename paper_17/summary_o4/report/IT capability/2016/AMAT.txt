Applied acknowledges that its distributed manufacturing model, which involves outsourcing contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development and information technology support, requires changes to existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing third-party providers, redistributing responsibilities, realizing potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assuring quality and continuity of supply and protecting intellectual property. The company must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to enhance its supply chain and improve back-office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing, as the implementation of new processes and information systems and additional functionality to existing systems entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt operations—such as the ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data—and during transitions it must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient. In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems and devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. Its ability to meet customer demand and manage operations may also be affected by information technology or infrastructure failures or service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, and even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues it must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers.

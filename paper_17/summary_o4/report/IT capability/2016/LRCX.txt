During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our workforce, and in sizing our supply chain infrastructure, workforce and other business components on a timely basis. We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment to ensure we have the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully. Our reliance on outsource providers and component suppliers extends to key transactional and administrative functions such as information technology, facilities management and elements of our finance organization, and where practical we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk of service failures. We note that transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as strikes, acts of God and natural or man-made disasters may materially affect our financial results. Our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in a few locations and are subject to disruption of our information technology resources, which could delay product shipments and erode customer trust. We maintain and rely upon critical information systems for the effective operation of our business, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications and e-mail, many of which are owned or maintained by us, our outsourced providers or third parties, and employ cloud computing technology for confidential data storage. All these information systems are subject to attacks, failures and access denials from a number of potential sources—including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines and networking equipment—and confidential or sensitive information stored on or transmitted by these systems could be compromised, lost or stolen. While we have implemented ISO 27001-compliant security procedures such as virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems and emergency recovery processes to mitigate these risks, they cannot be guaranteed failsafe, and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time or unauthorized releases of proprietary or confidential information could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, our results of operations and our reputation.

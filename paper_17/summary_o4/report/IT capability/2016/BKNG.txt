The Annual Report repeatedly underscores the critical role of information technology capabilities in coordinating the Company’s assets, processes and interfirm relationships and the substantial investments required to support and evolve those capabilities. It describes reliance on third‐party websites, primarily online search engines such as Google, meta‐search services and affiliate marketing, to generate traffic through pay‐per‐click campaigns and notes that changes in search algorithms, browser functionality or auction logic may increase costs and diminish traffic. The Company highlights that consumer adoption of mobile devices and the shift to mobile apps and optimized mobile websites create both growth opportunities and new challenges, including limited screen space, differing booking patterns, the need for rapid innovation and the risk that device companies such as Apple or Google might leverage their operating systems to favor competing travel offerings. In response, the Company has invested significant resources in developing, maintaining and enhancing its websites, mobile platforms and related technologies, including data center capacity, outsourced hosting and software development, and it reports information technology expenses for software licenses, system maintenance, data communications and outside consultants. The Report also cautions that rapid technological changes—such as the emergence of artificial intelligence, chatbot technologies, new internet or telecommunications architectures, “pop‐under” or other browser advertising formats—may require further expenditures to adapt services and infrastructure. A substantial portion of the Company’s technology risk discussion focuses on information security and data management, including the use of usernames, passwords, encryption and authentication to secure data, vulnerabilities to phishing, SQL injection, “denial‐of‐service” attacks and other breaches, limitations of existing security measures, the financial and reputational consequences of compromise, exposure to payment card association rules, and the absence of fully formalized disaster recovery plans in all regions. The Report warns that system capacity constraints, unanticipated service disruptions, or deterioration in performance of internal or third‐party systems—such as global distribution systems or external hosting providers—could impair service delivery, damage the Company’s reputation, increase customer support burdens and adversely affect results of operations.

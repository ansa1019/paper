The company’s disclosures emphasize that it relies extensively on its information technology environment, including critical databases, systems and applications, to support key product and service offerings and has made significant capital investments in IT data centers and other technology initiatives; it maintains policies, processes and internal controls intended to ensure the stability, connectivity, confidentiality and security of systems and to uphold business continuity, yet cautions that unanticipated system failures, data corruption, network or internet disruptions or unauthorized access—whether arising from cyber-attacks, security breaches, human error or failures by third-party service providers to meet contractual, regulatory or security obligations—could materially interrupt operations, damage client relationships or reputation and lead to regulatory, legal or financial losses; it has implemented disaster recovery plans, backup facilities and regular reviews of business continuity and key management succession, but acknowledges that certain systems are not fully redundant, disaster planning may be insufficient and that measures to mitigate expanding, sophisticated cyber threats and evolving privacy or benchmark regulations can be costly, may be circumvented or become obsolete, and cannot be guaranteed to deliver enhanced revenues or complete protection.

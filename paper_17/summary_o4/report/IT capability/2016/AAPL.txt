The company’s filings acknowledge that its operations depend critically on information technology systems and network infrastructure, warning that “information technology system failures or network disruptions” caused by natural disasters, power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins or other events could render system redundancy and disaster recovery planning ineffective or inadequate and thereby “prevent access to the company’s online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders,” as well as impede “the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.”  It notes that its “complex hardware and software products,” including sophisticated operating system software and applications sold through its iTunes Store and App Store, “often contain ‘bugs’” or third-party component defects that can “unexpectedly interfere with the software’s intended operation” or cause outages, slowdowns or errors in its online services.  To mitigate such risks, the company “devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures,” requires user names and passwords to access its IT systems, and uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure data transmission and storage, while monitoring accounts and freezing them under suspicious circumstances—yet cautions that these measures “cannot provide absolute security” and that “third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities” may still expose sensitive data.  The company further explains that its business “requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information (‘PII’)” and that it is subject to “federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII,” as well as payment card association rules that could “expose the company to significant fines or … liability” if security standards are not met.  Additionally, the company highlights that its retail stores and other facilities demand substantial investment in “information systems” alongside equipment, leasehold improvements, inventory and personnel, and that it leverages networking solutions, iCloud and online retail channels to distribute products worldwide, underscoring the strategic role of its technology infrastructure and information systems capability in supporting e-commerce, product introductions, inventory management, retail operations, logistics, transaction processing and financial reporting.

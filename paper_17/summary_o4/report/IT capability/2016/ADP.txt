The company discloses that it “relies heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems” and continually “upgrade[s], enhance[s], and expand[s] our existing solutions and services” to meet rapid technological advances and evolving client needs, while “devot[ing] significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes.”  It acknowledges that “attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication” and that “hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems.”  To manage these risks, the company has “programs in place to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents,” designs its operating environments “to safeguard and protect personal and business information,” and maintains “disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events.”  It warns that failure of any of these systems, or inability “to adapt our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences,” could lead to service interruptions, reputation damage and materially adverse effects on its operations, financial condition or competitive position.

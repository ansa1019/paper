We depend on information systems and technology, some of which are provided by third parties, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business – such as interfacing with customers and consumers, engaging in marketing activities, enabling and improving the effectiveness of our operations, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, managing inventory and facilities, conducting research and development, maintaining financial accuracy and efficiency, complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements, collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information, communicating electronically among our global operations and with employees and third parties, and communicating with our investors – and therefore our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to, cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise disrupted; cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature and are becoming more sophisticated thanks to a wide range of motives (including monetization of data, theft of trade secrets and political, social or economic leverage), and such events can take many forms (including cyber extortion, social engineering, introduction of malware such as ransomware through phishing emails, denial-of-service attacks or password theft), each of which can result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, lost revenues from computer system shutdowns, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or other confidential information, alteration or corruption of data, delayed financial reporting, remediation costs, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions and damage to our reputation; if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure – including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading security policies, improving the skills and training of our employees and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same – if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are compromised, destroyed or shut down, our business could be disrupted; we have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize certain information technology support services and administrative functions – including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions – to achieve cost savings and efficiencies, and failure by these service providers to perform effectively, or failure by us to adequately monitor their performance, could prevent us from realizing expected savings or require us to incur additional costs to correct errors or recover data, which could impair our reputation; and we continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions, and if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative or fail to deliver applications on time or provide adequate readiness and training, it could impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of our business, which could result in the loss of customers or consumers.

Starbucks’ business is underpinned by information technology systems, such as those used for point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs, and for administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of third party business partners and service providers, which contain personal, financial or other information and Starbucks proprietary and other confidential business information. The company relies heavily on information technology systems across operations—including supply chain management, Starbucks Cards, online business, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and interdependent processes and transactions—and its ability to effectively operate depends significantly on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems and platforms. Starbucks has experienced frequent attempts to compromise its information technology systems and continues to make significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches or data loss, but acknowledges that such security measures cannot provide assurance of success. Incidents such as unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customer or employee data or of proprietary information could result in material losses, reputational harm, regulatory liability and require significant capital investments—including additional security technologies, personnel and credit monitoring services—to remedy and prevent future breaches. Moreover, any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology—caused by power outages, inadequate redundancy, transition issues, software flaws or errors by employees or third parties—could harm the company’s ability to coordinate production, distribution, administration and sale of products and could materially negatively impact product availability, sales, operational efficiency and financial results if incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues effectively. To drive growth and competitive advantage, Starbucks continues to invest in digital platforms, delivering convenience and brand engagement through mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities, supporting business strategies and work processes, and expanding customer occasions outside its stores via digital infrastructure.

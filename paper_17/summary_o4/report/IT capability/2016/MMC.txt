The company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information; it shares electronic information with vendors and third parties, which comprises sensitive and confidential data, creating dependencies on both company and third-party IT resources and connectivity; as its infrastructure grows through use of mobile technologies, cloud services, social media and devices connected to the internet of things, the risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks increases while measures such as data encryption or multi-factor authentication take significant time and resources to deploy and may not be fully effective; due to the large number and age of systems and platforms, frequent vendor-issued security patches require testing and coordination with clients and vendors, and failure to patch promptly or dependency on third-party cloud providers may expose systems to breaches; numerous vendors and third parties receive personal information and may have direct system access, creating risks of improper access or disclosure and requiring robust technical safeguards and monitoring systems to detect, assess or respond to incidents; in providing services and solutions to clients, the company leverages globally dispersed systems and applications that necessitate regular cross-border data transfers and compliance with evolving privacy, data security and protection regulations, including GDPR, which impose significant operational and technology investments; the company has a history of acquisitions that necessitate complex integration of information systems, including identifying weaknesses, timely integration into the existing IT architecture and coordination of resources, failure of which may undermine the value derived from acquisitions or render systems vulnerable to attack; ongoing strategic initiatives involve investments in new technology platforms, systems and infrastructure to support growth, deploying new processes, changing how roles are performed to capture efficiencies, and responding to digital disruption and technological change across its businesses, where an inability to identify, integrate or invest sufficiently in relevant technologies, methodologies and IT governance could impair operational flexibility, business processes, competitive advantage and overall firm performance.

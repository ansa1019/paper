The process of developing new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and uncertain, and we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services.  If we fail to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends, extend our core technologies into new applications and platforms or adapt our solutions to new devices or operating systems, the market’s acceptance of our products and services could decline and our results would suffer.  We offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms and, to the extent that our competitors deliver innovative technologies more quickly or on emerging platforms, our competitive position could weaken.  Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments.  We devote significant resources to data center and network infrastructure to support the growth of our subscription and hosted services business, but we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, and failures in data collection or delivery, interruptions or delays in hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or hardware or software failures could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.  Because our customers collect and manage large volumes of customer data using our hosted solutions, hardware or software errors could result in data loss, corruption or incomplete or inaccurate information, and we may not be able to deliver data and reports in near real time, any of which could impair customer relationships, expose us to claims and harm our business.  Maintaining security and reliability of our products and networks is critical, and if we do not make appropriate investments in our technology systems or our systems become out-of-date or obsolete, or if consumers adopt security measures that inhibit our solutions, our business could be adversely affected.  From time to time we open-source certain of our technology initiatives, provide broader open access to our technology or license certain of our technology on a royalty-free basis, but incorrect predictions of customer requirements for open standards or open-source products could delay market acceptance and harm our business.  We also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings in new markets, which may require a considerable investment of technical, financial, compliance and sales resources and a scalable organization, and if we are unable to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors, our results of operations could suffer.  Our strategic shift toward subscriptions for creative cloud, document cloud and adobe marketing cloud offerings underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, our organizational capabilities, management skills, business process understanding and human resources to support business strategies and work processes, optimize operational flexibility, enhance customer value and create a recurring and predictable revenue stream.

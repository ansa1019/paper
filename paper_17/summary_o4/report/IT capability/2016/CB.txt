Our business depends critically on the effective deployment and integration of information technology resources—our computer systems and networks, data repositories and processing platforms—and the secure coordination of data and information flows both internally and with third-party service providers.  We rely on these systems to process, store and transmit confidential and proprietary information, to price products and services, establish and evaluate reserves, service our customers and distribution partners, administer claims, value investments, and timely and accurately report our financial results.  We continually implement and upgrade security measures and systems, including confidential intellectual property, monitoring and contingency plans, to guard against computer viruses, malware, cyber-attacks, unauthorized access, insider error or malfeasance and other security events, yet these measures may not fully prevent operational disruptions or data loss.  A failure in our IT infrastructure, whether stemming from security breaches, third-party system failures, pandemics or catastrophic events, could interrupt critical business functions, expose customer or counterparty information, result in regulatory enforcement actions, fines or litigation under increasingly stringent privacy, data security, anti-money laundering and anti-corruption laws, damage our reputation and cause significant financial loss.  Furthermore, rapid changes in technology, evolving legal and regulatory requirements, and the growing complexity of our global IT and security infrastructure pose ongoing challenges to ensuring information reliability, connectivity, accessibility and system resilience, and require us to continually mobilize IT-based resources in support of our operational flexibility and competitive capabilities.

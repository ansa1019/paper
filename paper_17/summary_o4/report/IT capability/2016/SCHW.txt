The company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, although violations could occur, and it has incurred and expects to continue to expend significant time and resources to develop, integrate, monitor, support and refine these systems and procedures in response to evolving rule-making. Its operations are highly dependent on the integrity, reliability, capacity and scalability of its technology systems and its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to support the processing, recording, monitoring and settlement of large volumes of client transactions. Security breaches of the company’s systems—or those of its clients or third parties—may arise from cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, external fraud involving compromised devices, or employee misconduct and could result in unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), service unavailability, regulatory actions or reputational harm. To address these risks, the company has designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies, advanced monitoring systems and internal authentication measures; limits employee access to sensitive data; provides privacy and security training; and maintains a geographically dispersed backup and recovery infrastructure with routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans, including collaboration with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions. The company also relies on external service providers to perform key technology, processing, servicing and support functions and manages this vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards and ongoing performance monitoring. In addition, the company employs models for asset management, capital planning, risk management, stress testing, compliance and related functions under a policy framework that defines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders in model development, management and use, and it uses periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls. Finally, the company attempts to manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls designed to achieve and monitor adherence to applicable legal and regulatory requirements across business conduct, trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client privacy, anti-money laundering, books and records and other key areas.

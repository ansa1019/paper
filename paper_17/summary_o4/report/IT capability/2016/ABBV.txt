AbbVie depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and acknowledges that failures or vulnerabilities in those systems—including malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy or security breaches by employees or others—could expose sensitive data such as intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information to unauthorized parties and materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations and cash flows. Although AbbVie has invested in protecting its data and information technology systems and continuously monitors those systems, it cannot guarantee that these measures will prevent breakdowns or breaches. In addition, any changes in the ability of third-party providers of information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to meet their contractual obligations could similarly impair AbbVie’s operations, operational flexibility and performance.

In our discussion of risk factors, we state that “our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients,” and we cite “digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving as developments such as artificial intelligence, automation, blockchain, internet of things and as-a-service solutions are commercialized”; we acknowledge that “technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue,” and that “some of these technologies … have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and may continue to do so in the future.” We note our responsibility to assist clients with “cloud enablement and the operation and maintenance of digital-related services” and describe our reliance on “information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners and vendors,” warning that “as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases.” We also disclose that “we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data, including personal data,” that “cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving,” and that “unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients … could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions.” In our management’s discussion and analysis, we emphasize our provision of systems integration consulting and application outsourcing “through use of lower-cost resources in our global delivery network” and the deferral and systematic amortization of “transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems,” reflecting the coordination, deployment and reconfiguration of IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes across our global operations.

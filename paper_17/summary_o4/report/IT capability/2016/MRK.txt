The company acknowledges an increasing dependence on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure to conduct critical operations and support for its information technology systems, and states that disruption, degradation or manipulation of these applications and systems—whether through cyber-attacks, unauthorized use or other means—could impact key business processes, lead to exposure or loss of confidential and sensitive information from its own or third-party databases, and result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm; in response, the company continuously leverages new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes, monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of company systems to reduce risks, and maintains ongoing efforts to protect its data and systems, while cautioning that there can be no assurance such measures will prevent service interruptions or loss of critical information.

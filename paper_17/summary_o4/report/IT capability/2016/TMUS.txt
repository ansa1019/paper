T-Mobile recognizes that ongoing technological change requires the firm to adapt its network infrastructure to evolving customer demands—“enhancing our network, such as deploying 5G, is subject to risk from equipment changes…and adoption of new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues”—and has launched a phased implementation of a new, third-party-supported billing system running in parallel with its legacy platform, warning that “any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays…could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services” and even give rise to material weaknesses in internal control. The company “relies upon both our systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers’ and our information,” yet acknowledges that “system failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems,” with threats ranging from “unauthorized access to our IT and business systems…cyber-attacks, errors or breaches by third-party suppliers” and “equipment failure” to human error, power outages or physical damage. In response, T-Mobile “regularly review[s] our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services” but concedes it “cannot assure you that the preventive actions we take will be adequate.” Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act the company further emphasizes it “relies heavily on IT systems as an important part of our internal controls…to operate, transact, and otherwise manage our business,” and warns that “failure to design and maintain effective internal controls, including those over our IT systems, could constitute a material weakness.” Finally, to support its complex operations, T-Mobile “relies heavily on suppliers, their subcontractors, and other third parties…to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services, such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support,” while also demanding that such partners adhere to its “third-party risk management standard” and supplier code of conduct.

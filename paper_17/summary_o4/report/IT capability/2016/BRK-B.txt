Berkshire Hathaway’s risk disclosures emphasize that the company relies on information technology in virtually all aspects of its business and that a significant disruption or failure of its information technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against intruders and other operational difficulties.  Attacks perpetrated against its information systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose the company to remediation costs and reputational damage.  Although steps have been taken to mitigate these risks—including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis—a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of assets or data corruption and could adversely affect Berkshire’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  The company further warns that if it is unable to acquire or implement new technology, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage with adverse effects on its financial performance, and that cyber attacks could impair its ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information.  In its regulated utilities and energy businesses, Berkshire notes that failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation, including those relating to cyber security, could have a significant adverse impact on its financial results.

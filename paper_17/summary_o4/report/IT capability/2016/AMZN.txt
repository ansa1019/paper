Certain competitors may secure better terms from vendors and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Our rapid global expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. Expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions may present new and difficult technology challenges and expose us to claims if customers experience service disruptions, failures, or other quality issues. If we do not adequately predict demand or optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could result in excess or insufficient capacity, increased costs, impairment charges, or both, as our networks become increasingly complex and challenging to manage. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time, we may experience system interruptions or slow response times that reduce net sales and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders. We use third-party technology and systems for encryption and authentication, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions, and although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss or other security breaches, such measures cannot provide absolute security. We experience occasional system interruptions and delays and recognize that if we are unable to continually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve efficiency, it could cause further interruptions and adversely affect our results. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, or electronic break-ins, any of which could cause system interruption, data loss, and prevent order processing or service delivery; our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In our management’s discussion and analysis, we emphasize improving all aspects of the customer experience—including faster delivery and performance times, increased reliability, and enhanced selection—by investing in technology infrastructure, innovative software and electronic devices, and the continuous expansion of our AWS compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. Technology and content costs principally consist of research and development activities and infrastructure expenses for application, production, maintenance, operation, and further development of existing and new products and services, and we expect spending in these areas to increase over time as we continue to hire personnel and add technology infrastructure. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit through increased direct sourcing, supplier discounts, process improvements, and customer self-service enhancements, while minimizing fixed cost growth through process efficiencies and a lean culture. Advances in processing power and wireless connectivity are viewed as key drivers for improving the consumer experience on the internet, and we routinely evaluate our facility and infrastructure requirements to support anticipated shipment volumes, expanded selection, and anticipated growth in both retail and third-party seller services.

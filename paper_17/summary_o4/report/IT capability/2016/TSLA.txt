The operation of our vehicles is highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and could contain defects and errors, and issues experienced by customers have included those related to the software for the 17-inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12-volt battery in the Model S and the seats and doors in the Model X. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with internet connectivity and free over-the-air software updates, and starting in the fourth quarter of 2016 we introduced a second generation of Autopilot hardware with enhanced functionalities to support improved safety and performance. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or proceedings and could negatively affect our brand. We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems by implementing new internally developed systems to assist in the management of our business, including volume production, product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, and financial, tax and regulatory compliance. There are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding these core systems — including potential disruptions to data management, procurement, manufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes — as well as deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting. We maintain information technology measures designed to protect against system security risks, data breaches and cyber-attacks, but failure to fully implement or expand these systems as planned could disrupt operations, compromise proprietary information and adversely impact our organizational capabilities and operating results.

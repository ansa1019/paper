The Company’s core offerings consist of enterprise cloud computing solutions—delivered on an annual subscription basis—that define, structure, manage and automate IT and service management processes across IT service management, IT operations management, IT business management, customer service, HR service management and security operations and extend to other non-IT service management applications, supported by its ServiceNow platform. To meet growing demand and support anticipated customer growth, the Company has made significant investments in its global cloud infrastructure, including data center capacity and related hardware assets dedicated to customer use and research and development, which it hosts in third-party facilities and manages on a co-located basis. The Company recognizes subscription revenues ratably over contract terms and accompanies this with deferred commissions and professional services engagements—such as implementation, configuration and training—performed both by internal personnel and contracted third parties, reflecting its information management capability in providing timely, secure and reliable access to data and system functionalities. As cyber-security threats and service disruptions can materially impair service reliability and customer trust, the Company continuously enhances its security measures, backup and disaster recovery capabilities and contingency planning, while acknowledging risks from malware, hacking, third-party software defects and natural disasters. Its ongoing research and development investments and global expansion initiatives, along with its partner ecosystem, underscore the firm’s commitment to mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources and organizational competencies to support business transformation, competitive advantage and operational efficiency.

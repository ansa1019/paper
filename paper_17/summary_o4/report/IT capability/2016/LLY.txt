The company discloses that it depends heavily on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and infrastructure—both those under its direct control and those managed by third parties—to accumulate, process, store and transmit large volumes of confidential corporate strategic plans, trade secrets, intellectual property and personally identifiable information and to support critical business processes such as product development, manufacturing operations, financial transactions and customer relationships.  It recognizes that these IT systems are potentially vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions, security breaches, malicious intrusions or cyber-attacks—including malware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering or insider misconduct—any of which could result in the loss, theft, destruction or unauthorized disclosure or use of sensitive information, impair its ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights, damage operations, customer relationships and reputation, expose it to regulatory sanctions or legal liability and erode competitive advantages.  Although the company has implemented measures and engages third-party service providers to prevent, respond to and minimize such risks, it acknowledges that these controls may not be sufficient and that any failure, inadequacy or breach of its IT systems could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and reputation.

We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data, and we depend on the integrity, security and consistent access to this data for sales, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment and order fulfillment; these systems and processes must be periodically maintained and updated yet remain subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, catastrophic events, acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by associates or service providers. Through our information technology developments—including multiple online communities and knowledge centers, the redesign of our homedepot.com website, updates to our mobile app and the deployment of our new Customer Order Management platform (“COM”)—we provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected retail experience that empowers customers to shop and interact from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices, using our websites and mobile app both as sales channels and as methods of providing product, project and other relevant information to drive in-store and online sales. We have implemented BOPIS, BOSS, BODFS and direct fulfillment programs, enabled a dynamic ETA feature for online orders and blended our physical and digital assets in a seamless, frictionless way, resulting in approximately 45% of our online U.S. orders being picked up in our stores. We have made significant investments in our supply chain and information technology systems through initiatives such as Project SYNC and COM, which are designed to streamline operations, reduce lead times, improve inventory turns and increase fulfillment options, while acknowledging that the cost and potential problems of implementing new web-based tools and services or managing third-party providers could disrupt operations or fail to deliver anticipated benefits. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services for cash, checks, credit and debit cards, PayPal, private-label credit cards and gift cards, and acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations, data security standards and certification requirements that may change or become more onerous. If our efforts to maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information are not successful, we could incur substantial additional costs, reputational damage and litigation, as our information systems and those of our third-party service providers and vendors remain vulnerable to continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. We have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access or use of data and to prevent data loss, and as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection, use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, we and our service providers must continually evaluate and adapt our systems, processes and overall security environment.

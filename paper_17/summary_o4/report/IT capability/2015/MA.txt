Mastercard’s disclosures reflect a heavy reliance on and continual enhancement of its information technology capabilities to support global transaction processing, network connectivity and data‐driven services. The company notes that rapid and significant technological changes—such as developments in smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce platforms, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology—can render existing solutions obsolete and may introduce competitive disadvantages if Mastercard is unable to anticipate, develop or adapt to evolving industry standards like EMV and tokenization. It relies on third parties, including some of its own competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies, and acknowledges that failures by these parties or resistance from issuers, acquirers or merchants to adopt new standards could inhibit its ability to deliver services. To mitigate cyber-threats and service interruptions, Mastercard maintains an extensive information security program and business continuity program—incorporating multiple layers of protection, ongoing system testing, disaster recovery planning and insurance coverage—while also depending on third‐party vendors for global data‐network transmission and remote connectivity solutions. The company highlights its work with large digital and technology firms to integrate payment safety and security into innovative offerings and notes that falling behind technologically could prompt those customers to develop proprietary platforms, disintermediating Mastercard. In addition, investments in data analytics through acquisitions aim to strengthen its consulting and research services, while regulatory requirements for privacy, data protection, fraud monitoring and information-based products continue to shape its technology operations, increase compliance burdens and influence product development, connectivity infrastructure and operational flexibility.

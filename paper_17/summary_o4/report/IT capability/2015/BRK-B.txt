Berkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of their business and acknowledge that a significant disruption or failure of their information technology systems could lead to service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures and an inability to protect information and assets against intruders, potentially resulting in misappropriation of assets, data corruption, loss of critical information, remediation costs, reputational harm and adverse effects on operating results, financial condition and liquidity. To mitigate these risks, the company has implemented business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analyses, yet it cautions that if it is unable to acquire or implement new technology effectively, it may suffer a competitive disadvantage. The company also warns that cyber attacks could further impair its ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information and may materially affect its capacity to raise capital.

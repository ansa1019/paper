The company’s disclosures emphasize its extensive reliance on and evolving demands for information technology capabilities across its retail operations, noting that customers “may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through e-commerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels or media (through internet-based and other digital or mobile channels or particular forms of social media), which may vary across demographics and may evolve rapidly,” and that “meeting demand effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed.” The firm “collects, stores, processes and transmits certain information from individuals, such as our customers and associates,” and “relies in part on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of personal and/or confidential information,” while recognizing that “compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business” by disrupting operations, damaging reputation, decreasing customer willingness to shop, violating applicable laws and subjecting the company to significant costs and liabilities. It “relies extensively on various information systems, including data centers, hardware and software and applications to manage many aspects of our business, including to process and record transactions in our stores, to enable effective communication systems, to plan and track inventory flow, to manage logistics, to generate performance and financial reports and to operate our e-commerce sites,” and is “dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems.” Supporting these systems “requires a number of resources, including effective and qualified, and in some cases, specialized, teams,” and the company must “continue to hire, train, manage and retain these teams, including to support our customized and legacy systems,” even as “our computer systems and the third-party systems we rely on are also subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes.” The company warns that “compromises, interruptions or shutdowns of our systems, whether intentional or inadvertent, could lead to delays in our business operations and, if significant or extreme, affect our results of operations,” and that “any interruption in the operation of our websites, particularly our e-commerce sites, could cause us to suffer reputational harm or to lose sales if customers are unable to access our site or purchase merchandise from us during such an interruption.” To address these risks, it “modifies, updates, and replaces our systems and infrastructure from time to time, including by adding new hardware, software and applications; maintaining, updating or replacing legacy programs; converting to global systems; integrating new service providers and adding enhanced or new functionality, such as for cloud computing technologies and for the continued operation and development of our e-commerce businesses; and adding new systems when we acquire new businesses,” while acknowledging the “inherent risks associated with modifying or replacing systems, with new or changed relationships and with changes from acquisitions, including accurately capturing and maintaining data, efficiently testing and implementing changes in a timely manner, realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems and diversion to internal teams’ attention.” The company concludes that “the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon our information systems, including our ability to operate and maintain them effectively, to select appropriate internal teams and vendors to maintain or enhance them and to select and implement appropriate new technologies, systems, controls, hardware, software and applications and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully,” and that “the failure of our information systems and the third party systems we rely on to perform as designed, or our failure to implement and operate them effectively, could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability.”

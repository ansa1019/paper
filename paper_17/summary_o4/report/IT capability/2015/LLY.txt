We depend on information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business; system inadequacies or operating failures could harm our business. We rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the company and some of which are outsourced, and these systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to corruption, damage, or interruption from a variety of sources, including energy or telecommunications failures, breakdowns, natural disasters, terrorism, war, computer malware or other malicious intrusions, and random attacks. To date, system interruptions have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations; we have implemented measures to prevent, respond to, and minimize the impact of system interruptions, but there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent future interruptions that would have a material adverse effect on our business. A great deal of confidential information owned by both us and our alliances is stored in our information systems, networks, and facilities or those of third parties, including valuable trade secrets and intellectual property, corporate strategic plans, marketing plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information, and the rapid growth of factors such as mobile computing capacity, high-speed Internet access, and social media exacerbates the risk of information security breaches that could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights, harm our competitive position, expose us to regulatory penalties and other costs, or damage the public trust in our company. We have invested and continue to invest to prevent, monitor, detect, and respond to information security breaches by strengthening our employee awareness and training, information technology systems, and business processes, and by strengthening data protection requirements for third parties that handle our confidential information; however, despite these efforts, we expect information security breaches to continue. We utilize third parties, including suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product development, the manufacture and commercialization of certain products, support for information technology systems, and certain financial transactional processes, and outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

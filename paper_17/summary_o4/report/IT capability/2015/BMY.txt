Bristol-Myers Squibb acknowledges that it is increasingly dependent on information technology and that any significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of its critical IT systems or infrastructure—whether by its own workforce, by authorized persons, or by unauthorized cyber-attackers—could negatively impact operations, lead to data leakage or theft of confidential information, cause reputational harm or interrupt business continuity. The ongoing evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, exposes the company to opportunities for both unintentional dissemination and intentional destruction of confidential information by malware, industrial espionage or other cyber-attacks, internally or at third-party providers. To mitigate these risks, the company has invested in industry-appropriate data and IT protections and monitoring practices, conducts continuous system surveillance for current and potential threats, and maintains policies and procedures to limit its direct-customer sales in compliance with SEC requirements, while relying on a network of suppliers, vendors, outsourcing and alliance partners to perform key business services—including marketing, selling, human resources, finance and IT—such that any failure or noncompliance by these third parties under varied legal and regulatory environments could materially disrupt BMS’s global operations.

Lockheed Martin’s Information Systems & Global Solutions segment is described as providing “advanced technology systems and expertise, integrated information technology solutions and management services” across civil, defense, intelligence and other government applications and is one of the company’s five business segments focusing on “defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.” In 2014 and 2013 the company acquired Systems Made Simple (health information technology solutions), Zeta Associates (information collection, processing, safeguarding and dissemination systems) and Industrial Defender (cybersecurity solutions for control systems), as well as Amor Group (United Kingdom information technology, civil government services and energy market), to expand its technology and information management capabilities. In its Risk Factors, Lockheed Martin notes it “routinely experience[s] cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our company sensitive information,” and acknowledges these threats may come from advanced adversaries targeting national security information, relying on mitigation processes and procedures that could be questioned if sensitive information is compromised; it also recognizes reliance on the cybersecurity safeguards of customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and venture partners. The company states it is “facing increased competition, particularly in information technology at our IS&GS business segment and cybersecurity at our MST business segment, from non-traditional competitors outside of the aerospace and defense industry.” Changes in the business environment require the firm “to be agile and evolve our business models, processes and products,” and program realignments shifted “C4ISR and government cyber programs” from IS&GS to MST. Further, the company identifies potential liabilities for “some cyber technologies we develop under contract” related to intellectual property, civil liberties and privacy, and notes that costs related to security threats “may not be fully insured or indemnified.”

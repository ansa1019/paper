UPS has undertaken several technology‐based initiatives, including facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of its on-road integrated optimization and navigation system (“ORION”), designed to increase network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability. In 2015, capital expenditures included $420 million for information technology to support these and other digital tools. The company relies on information technology networks and systems, including Internet-based platforms, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage and support a variety of business processes, activities and franchise operations. These IT systems, some managed by third parties, underpin yield management, capacity matching and enhanced time-in-transit performance, but remain susceptible to disruptions or shutdowns from software upgrades or replacements, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Breaches in security could expose UPS, its customers and franchisees to loss or misuse of proprietary or sensitive data, damage to brand and reputation, litigation and potential liability, and could require significant additional spending on data and system protection measures. The ongoing deployment of digital technologies and automation underscores UPS’s focus on mobilizing IT resources and integrating technology capabilities to support its global logistics strategy and competitive positioning.

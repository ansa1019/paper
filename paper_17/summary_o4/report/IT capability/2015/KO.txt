The company discloses that it “relies on networks and information systems and other technology (‘information systems’), including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, mergers and acquisitions and research and development,” and that these same systems are used “to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements.” It further explains that it “depends on information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations around the world and between company personnel and our bottlers and other customers, suppliers and consumers,” and that “because information systems are critical to many of the company’s operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or security breaches” caused by routine failures, malicious software, insider actions, cyberattacks, geopolitical events, natural disasters, telecom failures or similar “catastrophic” events. The company warns that such incidents could “result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information,” damage its ability “to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments,” risk violations of data privacy laws, “damage to the reputation and credibility of the company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest businesses or brands,” and trigger “significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.” To address these risks, the company “continues to make investments in personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of company personnel,” and “maintains an information risk management program which is supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee,” under which “reports that include analysis of emerging risks as well as the company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors.” In the context of its global productivity and reinvestment program, the company also cites “data and information technology systems standardization” as a core initiative undertaken to drive efficiency and reinvestment in marketing and operations.

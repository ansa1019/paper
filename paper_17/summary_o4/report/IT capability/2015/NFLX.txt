Netflix has made substantial investments in developing and integrating advanced information technology capabilities to support its streaming service, including the deployment of proprietary and third-party cloud computing services (notably Amazon Web Services) and the build-out of a global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to stream high volumes of video content to a broad array of consumer devices. These initiatives are reflected in the Company’s Technology and Development expenses, which encompass payroll and related costs for enhancements to its user interface, recommendation and merchandising algorithms, streaming delivery infrastructure and computing hardware and software. Netflix’s reliance on its own communications and computer hardware systems, third-party web hosting providers and content-delivery networks underpins operational flexibility and market responsiveness but also introduces risks related to network neutrality rules, ISP interconnection practices and potential usage-based pricing structures that could impair service performance or increase operating expenses. The Company’s information management capabilities extend to the collection, encryption, authentication and protection of member data, including personal and billing information, and compliance with evolving data protection laws, mitigations against cyber-attacks and system interruptions, and ongoing enhancements to its distributed computing architecture and security controls, all of which illustrate its competence to acquire, configure and leverage IT resources in alignment with its global expansion and competitive strategy.

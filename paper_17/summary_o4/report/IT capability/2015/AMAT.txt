Appliedâ€™s Global Services segment encompasses integrated solutions including factory automation software to optimize equipment and fabrication performance and productivity. The company utilizes outsourced functions such as software development and information technology support alongside contract manufacturing, engineering and other administrative activities, which has required changes to its operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing third-party providers and redistributing responsibilities in order to realize productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect intellectual property. Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance its supply chain and improve back-office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. However, adding new processes and functionality to existing systems entails risks, such as disruptions to order tracking, shipment timing, inventory projections, supply chain management and the aggregation of financial and operational data, and manufacturing interruptions or delays could result from information technology or infrastructure failures. In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including confidential information belonging to Applied or its customers and personally-identifiable information of individuals, and has experienced cybersecurity threats ranging from employee error to advanced persistent threats. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse.

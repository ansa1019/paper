Our risk disclosures highlight that market disruptions and longer sales cycles can delay the adoption of new technologies, including the software and digital solutions integral to our products and services, and emphasize that our ability to correctly identify customer needs, allocate research and development funding, anticipate and respond to competitive technological innovations, secure adequate intellectual property rights and successfully commercialize new digital offerings in a timely manner are critical to avoiding obsolescence and sustaining competitive advantage. We acknowledge that our operations take place in industries characterized by rapid technological change and frequent product introductions, which obliges us to make continuous investments in technology development, process optimization and business transformation initiatives. We also rely extensively on information technology systems—some operated by third parties—to process, store and transmit sensitive electronic information and to coordinate and support our critical business processes, but we recognize that these systems may be exposed to computer viruses, malicious code, unauthorized access and other cyber‐attacks and that our system redundancy and disaster recovery planning may be inadequate. We further note that any security breaches or technology failures could result in the misappropriation of confidential data, disruptions to operational continuity, legal exposure under privacy and data security laws and harm to customer relationships. In our management discussion and analysis, we underscore the impact of rapid technological development—particularly in computing, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization—on market demand and describe our significant organic and acquisition‐led investments to enhance our technology infrastructure, global research and development and customer‐facing capabilities to meet evolving business needs, improve organizational integration and support ongoing firm performance.

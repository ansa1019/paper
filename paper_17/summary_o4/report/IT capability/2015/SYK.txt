We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct virtually all aspects of our business, including ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, providing data security and other processes necessary to manage our business, and supporting our new global enterprise resource-planning system that will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems.  These systems encompass networks and services such as internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, hardware, software, technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted or provided by third parties, and form a critical element of our operational infrastructure and business continuity planning.  We have implemented investments in monitoring of networks and systems, the hiring of cybersecurity experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third‚Äêparty providers to address numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and to our responsibilities to governments.  If our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, if a breach of information security or failure of one or more key systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers occurs, or if our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action, and the costs and operational consequences of interruptions in our operations and responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant.

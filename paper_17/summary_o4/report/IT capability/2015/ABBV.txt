Abbvie acknowledges in its risk factors that it depends on information technology and that a failure of those systems could materially and adversely affect its business. It states that it relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business, which are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, or breakdown. Although Abbvie has invested in protection of its data and information technology and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, it concedes there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in its information technology systems that could adversely affect operations. Additionally, among other factors that could have a material adverse effect, Abbvie identifies changes in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll, and other outsourced services to meet their contractual obligations. The companyâ€™s discussion of operational efficiencies further reflects its reliance on technology-enabled process optimization in support of its business strategies.

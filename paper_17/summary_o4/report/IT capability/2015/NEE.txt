NEE and FPL acknowledge in their Risk Factors that they are highly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to coordinate generation, transmission and distribution operations, billing, payment processing, risk management, trading activities and compliance reporting in a heavily regulated environment.  Despite extensive security measures, these IT systems remain vulnerable to disablement, failures or unauthorized access from cyber attacks, operator error, severe weather, terrorism or failures of third-party systems, any of which could compromise sensitive or customer data, disrupt business processes, impede the collection and processing of payments, delay development and construction of new facilities, divert managementâ€™s attention and resources, and otherwise adversely affect operational efficiency, regulatory filings and financial results.  NEE and FPL further disclose that the ongoing addition, modification and replacement of information systems and controls is costly and entails risks related to system integration, accounting procedure changes and accurate data conversion, and that any deficiencies or delays in these activities could lead to increased costs, inability to track and collect revenues, deterioration of internal controls and material adverse impacts on their business, financial condition and prospects.

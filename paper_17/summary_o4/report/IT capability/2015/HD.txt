The company emphasizes its extensive reliance on and continuous enhancement of its information technology capabilities to support and interconnect its assets, processes and customer interactions. The risk factors note that customers increasingly use computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices to shop online, compare prices and determine real-time product availability, prompting implementation of programs such as BOSS, BOPIS, direct fulfillment and the rollout of BODFS, all of which depend on integrated IT systems and a compelling online presence to deliver a superior customer experience. The report warns that a failure of a key information technology system or process, some managed by third-party service providers, could disrupt critical functions—analyzing, processing, storing, managing and protecting transactions and data—and impair the interconnected retail strategy. It acknowledges the vulnerability of its information systems and those of its vendors to evolving cybersecurity risks and describes a major payment security project providing enhanced encryption at the point of sale, the rollout of EMV chip card technology, and ongoing reviews and updates of processes to protect against unauthorized access, data loss and misuse. In addition, its MD&A outlines investments in digital infrastructure, including the pilot and planned rollout of COM (customer order management system) to all U.S. stores, expansion of distribution fulfillment centers to accelerate parcel shipping, and the use of second-generation “first phones,” web-enabled handheld devices, mobile experience enhancements, digital content and site improvements to empower store associates, increase online sales conversion rates by 25.4%, and facilitate over 40% of online orders being picked up in stores. The report further discusses “Project Sync,” a multi-year supply chain and technology initiative leveraging web-based tools to reduce lead time and improve inventory turns, and characterizes information security, network encryption, system maintenance, data management, electronic payment processing and e-commerce platform enhancements as integral to its operational efficiency, technology deployment, value chain integration and competitive positioning in a digital marketplace.

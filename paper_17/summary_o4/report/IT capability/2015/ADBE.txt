Adobe’s disclosures highlight that the firm’s information technology capabilities underpin its evolution to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions, requiring long-term investments to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology resources—such as network infrastructure and data centers—alongside management skills, business process understanding and human resources to support its creative cloud, document cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings; the company emphasizes that developing new high-technology products and enhancing existing services is “complex, costly and uncertain,” demanding continued investment in product development, cloud operations and technology infrastructure, strategic relationships with third parties for marketing, hosting and functionality support, open-source initiatives and digital application marketplaces, and the ability to adapt solutions for new platforms, operating systems and market models; maintaining robust information management capability—providing data and information with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access in near real time—is critical to driving operational flexibility, subscription and hosted service revenue recognition and renewal rates, and failure to invest adequately in technology systems, manage vendor and hosting relationships, ensure redundancy and disaster recovery, anticipate technological change or respond to evolving privacy and security regulations may impair service availability, expose customer data to security breaches, disrupt processing systems and controls, undermine customer confidence and harm the firm’s competitive position and financial performance.

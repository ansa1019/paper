Our risk disclosures highlight that any general weakening of the global economy or curtailment of government or corporate spending could prompt customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology budgets and spending, which in turn could delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services and impair their ability to deploy and leverage IT capabilities. We operate in the information technology business, offering products and services—including our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and on-premises deployments—that store, retrieve, manipulate and manage both internal and external data, and we have invested heavily in information security, reliability, confidentiality, connectivity and scalability to protect these environments. Rapid technological advances, evolving computer hardware and software standards and sophisticated customer requirements compel us to continue developing, integrating and enhancing our software, cloud and hardware portfolios; in fiscal 2015 we invested $5.5 billion in research and development to strengthen our application, platform and infrastructure offerings, engineer virtualization and management capabilities for cloud and hybrid IT deployments, and ensure interoperability across single-server or clustered configurations and multiple operating systems. Our engineered systems are designed to work seamlessly with customers’ on-premises and cloud infrastructures, enabling rapid deployment, operational flexibility and optimized performance, while our consulting services align IT strategy, enterprise architecture planning and design, implementation, integration and ongoing support to mobilize IT resources in support of business processes, digital transformation and competitive advantage.

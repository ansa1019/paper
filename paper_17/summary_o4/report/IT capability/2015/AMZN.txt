Our rapid global expansion has increased the complexity of our operations, systems, technical performance, and infrastructure across North America, international, and AWS segments, requiring continual upgrades of our systems and network infrastructure to improve efficiency and prevent system interruptions or delays, as failures to add software, hardware, or capacity proactively or to sustain fully redundant systems and robust disaster recovery plans could make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond, thereby adversely affecting order fulfillment, compute, storage, and other service offerings. We rely on substantial infrastructure capacity, including fulfillment and data center capability that has become increasingly complex to operate as we add new businesses with different requirements, and we may be unable to optimize or operate our networks effectively, which could result in excess or insufficient capacity, increased costs, impairment charges, or harm to customer experience. Our commercial relationships, e-commerce services agreements, and strategic alliances depend on the implementation, maintenance, and integration of web services, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, content delivery, hardware, and third-party software, and we may be unable to integrate acquired technology, rights, or administrative systems – including information security and monitoring systems – to provide reliable, timely, secure, and confidential information at scale. We use third-party technology for encryption, authentication, employee email, content delivery, and other functions, but such systems and processes cannot provide absolute security and we remain subject to payment card association data security rules, certification requirements, and evolving regulatory and licensing regimes. The timing, effectiveness, and costs of expanding and upgrading our systems and infrastructure are material to our competitive positioning, operational flexibility, and our ability to support growing unit sales, marketplace and AWS customer usage, and to manage variables such as inventory levels, delivery performance times, and seller and third-party transactions; failure to execute on our technology and content investments – including significant capitalization of internal-use software and website development and ongoing depreciation – could lead to quality issues, service disruptions, or other challenges that may harm our reputation and financial results.

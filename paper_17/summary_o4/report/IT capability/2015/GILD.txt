The disclosure highlights that our U.S. wholesalers operate under inventory management agreements that require them to estimate end‐user demand and align inventory with actual demand, reflecting the need for accurate information management and coordination across internal processes and supply‐chain partners. We acknowledge that our inability to accurately predict demand, uptake of new products or inventory fluctuations complicates sales forecasting and revenue recognition and underscores the importance of robust data analytics and forecasting systems. Our foreign currency hedging program, which employs forward and option contracts to manage exchange‐rate risk on forecasted international sales and monetary assets, depends on timely data, connectivity and monitoring systems. We record product sales net of mandatory and supplemental discounts, rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts, distributor fees and other deductions, an accounting process that relies on integrated financial systems and data management to ensure accuracy and compliance with statutory and contractual requirements. The coordination required among sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, legal and finance for specialty pharmacy distribution of products such as Letairis and Cayston—especially for Cayston’s drug–device combination—illustrates the need for interorganizational relationship management, process automation and communication facilitation. We extensively outsource clinical trials to contract research organizations, yet remain responsible for study design, document preparation, program management, site monitoring and bioanalytical analysis, requiring integrated information systems and governance to ensure data timeliness, reliability and security. Collaborative agreements with corporate partners for commercialization, development and manufacturing of our products across multiple territories demand organizational integration of external data flows, strategic resource allocation and dynamic capabilities to respond to market access, reimbursement and regulatory requirements. We depend on information technology systems, infrastructure and data to support our global operations, but recognize vulnerabilities to service interruptions, cyberattacks and data privacy breaches that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical information and adversely affect organizational effectiveness and business continuity.

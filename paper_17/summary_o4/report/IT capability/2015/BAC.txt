The firm’s operational and security infrastructure—comprising its computer and data‐management systems, network and backup systems, software, internal processes and related controls, as well as the systems of third‐party vendors and counterparties—is integral to its performance and continuity. Disruptions or failures of these systems, whether from human error, system malfunctions, telecommunications or power outages, natural disasters, pandemics or political and terrorist events, could impair transaction processing, customer service, or regulatory and risk reporting processes. The corporation relies on digital technologies to support its broad internet and mobile banking channel strategies and remote connectivity solutions, and its capacity to transmit, store and tailor data and information securely to meet business needs. As cyber threats evolve—ranging from computer viruses and malicious code to phishing attacks, denial‐of‐service events and other destructive or unauthorized intrusions—the firm faces heightened risks of operational loss, reputational harm and regulatory intervention unless it continually enhances its cybersecurity controls, incident response, data protection and system integration capabilities.

Our disclosures emphasize that we are dependent on sophisticated information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations globally and with clients, alliance partners and vendors, recognizing that this infrastructure continues to grow in breadth and complexity through mobile technologies, social media, cloud services, digital, analytics, mobility, Internet of Things, as-a-service solutions, security, cognitive computing and IT automation; that we manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential data, subject to complex data-protection laws; and that we must adapt and expand our services and solutions, including technology integration consulting and application outsourcing delivered through our global delivery network and lower-cost resources, to anticipate and respond to rapid changes in technology and industry developments, drive innovation, support clientsâ€™ cost-savings and operational-efficiency programs, and enable business transformation and digital enablement; we describe the strategic investments required to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources, the transition costs for personnel, processes and systems necessary for outsourced services, the allocation of revenues on multi-deliverable contracts under percentage-of-completion accounting, and the need to maintain skilled personnel and effective governance controls to manage cyber-security risks, regulatory compliance, infrastructure disruptions and the integration of third-party systems and alliances, all of which are critical to sustaining our competitive advantage and firm performance.

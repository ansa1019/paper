The company recognizes that its reliance on information technology underpins virtually every aspect of its operations and that evolving regulatory, competitive and security landscapes have broadened the scope of IT capability to encompass the coordination of its assets, internal processes and external relationships.  In particular, it acknowledges substantial exposure to cyber-attacks and other security events that could disrupt business, damage its reputation and cause losses, and it therefore “implements new security measures and systems, including the use of confidential intellectual property, and improves or upgrades our existing security measures and systems on a continuing basis.”  The report further states that “our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information and assets, including in our computer systems and networks and those of third-party service providers,” and that its ability “to adequately price products and services, to establish reserves, to provide effective, efficient and secure service to our customers, to value our investments and to timely and accurately report our financial results also depends significantly on the integrity and availability of the data we maintain,” both within its own IT infrastructure and in data and assets held by outsourced providers.  It also notes that as the breadth and complexity of its security infrastructure grows, the potential risk of a security event increases and that any such event may necessitate “significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures and to pursue recovery of lost data or assets.”  The company is subject to a wide range of rapidly evolving information security and privacy laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions, which “increasingly demand” higher levels of governance, controls and auditing, and it may “face challenges … requiring the use of information technology that cannot be quickly adjusted to address new regulatory requirements.”  To support its competitive positioning and strategic decision-making, the company “uses various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) and data analytics to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities,” thereby mobilizing and leveraging IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to maintain advantageous market responsiveness.  Any failure of its technology infrastructure, whether from cyber-attack, system failure, third-party service disruption or regulatory change, could therefore have an adverse effect on its business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

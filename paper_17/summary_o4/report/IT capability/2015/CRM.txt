The Company’s risk disclosures make clear that its evolving IT capabilities—which encompass the coordination of internal assets and processes as well as interfirm transactions and relationships—depend on comprehensive security measures across its own IT systems, third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and service partners to support secure storage, transmission and tailoring of customer data with requisite accuracy, timeliness, reliability, confidentiality, connectivity and access.  It acknowledges that the complexity of hardware and proprietary or third-party software can introduce latent defects or disruptions, unanticipated downtime and integration challenges—especially when incorporating acquired technologies—and therefore requires substantial investments in data center capacity, redundant replication for disaster recovery and business continuity, ongoing upgrades or replacements of internal systems and infrastructure, and careful vendor management of computer hardware, database software, cloud platforms and related services.  As it scales globally, the Company must navigate a web of domestic and foreign privacy laws, cross-border data transfer restrictions and industry-specific regulations that influence its information management capability and IT governance, maintain voluntary third-party certifications, secure necessary regulatory approvals, and safeguard against evolving tactics for unauthorized access or denial-of-service attacks.  These considerations drive its capital expenditures for technology infrastructure and professional services, its expansion of research, development, monitoring and support personnel, and its reliance on deferred commission structures and multiyear subscription contracts to align resource deployment, operational flexibility and firm performance in an intensely competitive, rapidly evolving market for enterprise cloud computing and CRM solutions.

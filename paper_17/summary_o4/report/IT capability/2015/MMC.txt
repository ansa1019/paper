Our business critically depends on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information. These information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malware, ransomware and other security breaches, as well as improper actions by employees, vendors or third parties with legitimate access, and the growing breadth and complexity of our infrastructure—including mobile technologies, cloud services, social media and internet-connected devices—magnifies these risks. Although encryption and multi-factor authentication can protect data, we may not be able to encrypt data across our diverse systems, and significant time and resources are required to deploy and maintain prevailing security measures. The large number of systems and platforms we operate and the increased frequency of vendor security patches—often requiring testing and coordination with clients and third parties—exposes us to the risk of delayed or insufficient patch deployment, while reliance on third-party vendors like cloud providers exposes us to additional service-interruption and breach risks. The integration of acquired businesses’ information systems is complex and may expose us to unexpected liabilities or vulnerabilities if weaknesses are not identified or if systems cannot be integrated in a timely manner. Our policies, procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential, personal or proprietary information, and data incidents such as malware incursions, phishing campaigns, unauthorized access and user error have resulted in data loss and, if undetected or inadequately remediated, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In providing services globally we store and transfer sensitive client and company data across multiple jurisdictions and increasingly complex systems, subjecting us to evolving and sometimes conflicting privacy and data protection regulations—such as the EU’s data protection directive, the GDPR and various U.S. federal and state laws—and data localization requirements that impose significant compliance costs. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information could subject us to litigation, regulatory enforcement, fines (including up to 4% of global annual revenue under the GDPR), negative publicity and reputational harm, and our cyber insurance may not be sufficient to cover related liabilities. Moreover, our ability to recover from disasters or business continuity events—ranging from cyber-attacks and security breaches to power, telecommunications or office facility failures—depends on the resilience of our technology infrastructure, and significant or prolonged service outages could materially interrupt operations, damage client relationships and require substantial remedial expenditures.

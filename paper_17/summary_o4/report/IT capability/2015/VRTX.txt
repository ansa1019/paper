We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business and, in the course of our operations, collect, store and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), making it critical that we do so in a secure manner to preserve confidentiality and integrity.  The size and complexity of these information technology and information security systems renders them potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or security breaches from software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyberattacks, employee misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or other events, any of which could result in data security breaches, loss of critical data, interruptions in our operations and exposure to private and governmental claims.  Although we have implemented security measures and adopted a business continuity plan to mitigate these risks, we cannot guarantee that such efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches that could materially harm our business.  In both domestic and foreign jurisdictions, the regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, with various countries enacting or considering laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information; we have historically relied on frameworks such as the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor for data transfers, but must now address the invalidation of that framework and the attendant risk of enforcement actions and penalties if we fail to comply with applicable data-protection laws, noting that government investigations into such matters can consume significant resources and attract adverse publicity.

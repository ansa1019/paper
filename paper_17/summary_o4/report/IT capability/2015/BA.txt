Boeing identifies its information technology environment—including data integrity, system availability and cyber-security—as critical to its operational flexibility and market performance, noting that disruptions or failures in IT systems, cyber-attacks, or unauthorized access could materially affect internal processes, product and service delivery, sales, costs and corporate reputation. To address these risks, the company maintains an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity, while acknowledging that sophisticated attacks or system failures may still yield significant financial or data losses. The company also manages information technology systems for certain customers, recognizing that any breach or corruption of confidential, classified or personally identifiable information could further impair Boeing’s financial position and market standing. Moreover, Boeing’s fleet support offerings include information services and systems providing technical data and documents to users, enhancing the coordination of assets, compliance with regulatory standards and support of customer maintenance processes.

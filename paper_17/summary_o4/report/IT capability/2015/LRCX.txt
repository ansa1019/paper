The company discloses that during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand it faces “significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our work force, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis.”  It acknowledges that its operations are subject to “transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, and natural or man-made disasters,” and that its primary manufacturing facilities could be disrupted by failures in “our information technology resources.”  The company maintains and relies upon critical information systems—including telecommunications, the Internet, its corporate intranet, computer hardware and software applications, network communications, e-mail, and outsourced or cloud-based hosted software applications for confidential data storage—and although it has implemented security procedures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, it warns that attacks, failures, or access denials of these systems “could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business.”  It further notes that it depends on outsourced providers for transactional and administrative functions, “such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization,” and that failure of these third parties to secure or protect intellectual property rights, meet performance expectations, or maintain service continuity could adversely affect its business.

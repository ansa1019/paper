The report warns that “if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results will be adversely affected,” and that to manage growth it “must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.” It cautions that it “may not be able to successfully scale improvements to our enterprise resource planning system or implement or scale improvements to our other systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner or in a manner that does not negatively affect our operating results,” and that its “existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud.” To this end, the company “has licensed technology from third parties to help us accomplish this objective” but “may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software, which could disrupt existing customer relationships, cause us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our products, or increase our technical support costs.” It further notes that “failure to improve our systems, processes, and controls, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings, or to prevent certain losses,” and illustrates this by stating that “we are implementing certain new enterprise management systems and any failure to implement these systems may disrupt our operations and our operating expenses could increase.”

The company’s operations depend critically on robust information technology systems and infrastructure that help it operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce its financial statements.  It acknowledges that business disruptions, including internet security threats, damage to global communication networks or faults in its technology infrastructure, could interfere with transaction processing, data collection, storage, reporting and access, thereby impairing planning, forecasting, regulatory compliance and timely reporting of operating results.  The company requires the allocation and effective management of resources to build and sustain its technology infrastructure, including user access controls, encryption and authentication technologies, monitoring systems and data management systems, to secure and properly tailor data and information in support of its business needs and to protect personally identifiable information of customers, employees and business partners.  It cautions that a breach of these systems—whether due to third-party security compromises, employee error, malfeasance, or malicious software—could result in unauthorized access to data, interruption or cessation of service, loss of reputation, customer relationships and brand value, potential litigation and liability, and material adverse impacts on its business, financial condition and cash flows.

As part of our 2015 restructuring plan, we have outsourced certain IT services and application development and initiated consolidation and standardization of our information systems, but these efforts expose us to the risk that modifications or upgrades may be costly, disruptive and could impair our internal controls if not properly managed. The proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems— which must be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business— is critical to our operations, and any interruption, failure or delay caused by system changes, integration of new technologies, or evolving administrative requirements could materially disrupt our operations. We rely extensively on third-party providers and business partners for help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration, and voice, video and remote access, as well as for the operation of regional product distribution centers and management of work-in-process and finished product logistics; we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their obligations in a timely or adequate manner, and any failure on their part could materially disrupt our supply chain and business. As our IT environment evolves to embrace mobility and cloud-based data sharing to promote business efficiency, we face a more distributed infrastructure that complicates our ability to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, meet scalability and administrative requirements, and ensure compliance with regulatory obligations. If our security controls cannot keep pace with these changes, or if we fail to prevent or detect unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, data breaches or other security incidents, we could suffer significant remediation costs, litigation, liability, reputational harm and damage to our intellectual property, our product development timelines and our competitive position. We also maintain sensitive proprietary and personally identifiable worker and customer information on our networks, and we anticipate increasing expenditures for enhanced data security procedures, employee training, breach remediation and mitigation of reputational harm; any failure by us or our third-party providers to adopt and maintain adequate data security practices could materially damage our operations, financial condition and strategic objectives.

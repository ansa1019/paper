AMD’s disclosures emphasize that IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise its intellectual property or other sensitive information and cause significant operational disruption and reputational harm. The company maintains sensitive data on its IT assets and, in many cases, on its partners’ and third-party providers’ IT systems, including proprietary and confidential business and customer information, and underscores that preserving the accuracy, confidentiality, integrity and availability of this information is critical to its business and reputation. AMD acknowledges an evolving threat landscape of unauthorized access, hacking, phishing, system disruptions and insider or state-sponsored attacks that could divert management and key IT resources, incur substantial remediation costs and delay product development. It anticipates ongoing and increasing expenditures to enhance and implement information security controls—such as upgrades to applications, network and computer security components—train personnel, remediate breaches and address litigation, mitigate reputational damage and achieve compliance with regulations including the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. The company also highlights its reliance on internal business processes and information systems to support key functions, noting that modifications, upgrades or consolidation efforts may introduce operational risks, threaten internal controls and require significant employee and third-party training. As AMD’s IT environment evolves to embrace mobility and cloud-based data sharing to promote business efficiency, it warns that a more distributed architecture could impede visibility, control and scalability, and that vulnerabilities to events beyond its control—such as power outages, natural disasters, malware or third-party failures—could materially impair its financial condition, competitive position and operating results if security controls cannot keep pace or regulatory requirements cannot be met.

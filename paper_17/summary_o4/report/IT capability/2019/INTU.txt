In its strategic risk discussion, the company emphasizes its reliance on the ability to adapt to technological change and global trends in the way customers access software offerings and to successfully introduce new and enhanced products, services and business models, which requires the continuous development of skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies. Operational risks include internal and external events relating to systems, processes and personnel, problems with information technology infrastructure, and the complexity and scalability challenges of multiple technology platforms, any of which could impair the accurate, reliable and timely processing of customer data or the availability of products and services. The company further highlights its dependence on internal systems and third-party services, including public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, to host, collect and process large volumes of sensitive customer and workforce data, and acknowledges that cyberattacks, software vulnerabilities (notably in open source components), social engineering and other security incidents may result in unauthorized access, data loss, service disruptions and reputational harm. The MD&A underscores that growth and competitive positioning increasingly depend on the ongoing operation and availability of its platforms and systems and those of its external partners, prompting significant investments in information technology infrastructure, platform enhancements, mobile device compatibility, network security and privacy controls to support business strategies, operational flexibility and regulatory compliance.

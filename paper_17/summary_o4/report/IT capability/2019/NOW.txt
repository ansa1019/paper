Throughout our disclosure, we recognize that information technology capabilities have become fundamental to coordinating our customers’ assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions, and that as a cloud-based service provider we must continuously acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of evolving business strategies and digitized workflows. We compete by identifying and innovating in emerging digital technologies—public and private cloud infrastructure, massively scalable databases, mobile user experiences, social collaboration tools, machine learning, artificial intelligence, internet-connected devices, robotic automation, security and cryptography—and by investing in and optimizing our platform and IT architecture to meet customers’ high performance, reliability, connectivity, security and data management requirements. Our operations involve the storage, transmission and processing of sensitive customer data across geographically distributed data centers, requiring robust IT governance, compliance with data privacy and residency regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, FedRAMP, DoD Impact Level 4) and continual refinement of monitoring systems, change management and service availability practices. To mobilize actionable IT capabilities, we invest in infrastructure, software development operations, professional services, partner-delivered implementation services and training, and leverage usage analytics, process automation and scalable architecture to deliver organizational effectiveness, operational flexibility, competitive advantage and ongoing digital transformation for our customers.

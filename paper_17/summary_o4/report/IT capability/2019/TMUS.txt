Our operations depend critically on the continued evolution and deployment of information technology capabilities, including our internal IT systems and networks, as well as those of third-party providers and suppliers, to enable efficient coordination of assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions. We rely heavily on IT systems and automated processes as part of our internal controls to operate, transact and report financial results, and we are implementing a new billing system alongside our legacy infrastructure, which may experience unanticipated difficulties, operational disruptions or cyber-attacks that could adversely affect our ability to bill and provide services, maintain internal control over financial reporting and meet changing business needs. Our business involves receipt, storage and transmission of confidential customer, employee and supplier information, and our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, data loss or other security breaches must be continually evaluated, as cyber-attacks such as denial of service or other malicious attacks could disrupt internal systems and applications, impair service delivery and compromise information security, confidentiality, reliability, timeliness, connectivity and access. System failures or outages of our IT business systems, including theft of proprietary information, unauthorized access to our IT and business systems and those of our suppliers, or infrastructure damage, could materially affect operational efficiency, reputation and financial condition, possibly resulting in litigation, regulatory scrutiny and remediation costs to repair systems, replace data or incentivize customers. We depend on suppliers, service providers, subcontractors and other third parties to develop, maintain and troubleshoot network components, software development services and billing and customer service support, and any failure or inability of such parties to provide these technology resources could adversely affect our business, impair resource allocation and limit our ability to adapt to technological developments, deploy advanced digital networks such as 5G, manage investments, and sustain competitive advantage in market dynamics.

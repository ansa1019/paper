The company discloses that it is dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including its kite Konnect platform, which is critical to ensure chain of identity and chain of custody of Yescarta, and notes that the multitude and complexity of its computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. It warns that data privacy or security breaches—whether through employee error or external actors—could expose sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of employees, patients, customers or other business partners, to unauthorized persons or to the public. The company acknowledges that cyberattacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and may include malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other methods that threaten service reliability and data confidentiality, integrity and availability; it also recognizes that its business and technology partners face similar risks that could adversely affect its security posture. Although the company has invested, and will continue to invest, in the protection of its data and IT infrastructure, it cautions that these efforts, and those of its partners and vendors, cannot guarantee prevention of future service interruptions or identification of breaches, which could result in loss of critical or sensitive information and cause financial, legal, business or reputational harm. In addition, it highlights that regulators globally are imposing new data privacy and security requirements—such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act—that introduce enhanced confidentiality, accuracy, timeliness, connectivity and access obligations and may impose significant monetary fines or private-action liabilities; non-compliance with these evolving laws could greatly increase the company’s cost of providing products and services or even prevent the company from offering certain services in specific jurisdictions. The company further notes that government price reporting and payment regulations are complex, requiring continual assessment of the methods by which it calculates and reports pricing in accordance with these obligations, and that its methodologies are inherently subjective and may be subject to review and challenge by various government agencies, with any disagreement potentially leading to restatements of previously reported data and additional financial or legal liability.

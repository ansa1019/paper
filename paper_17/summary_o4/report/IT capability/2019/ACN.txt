Our disclosures emphasize that our firm’s IT capability underpins our competitive strength and operational flexibility by driving the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings and by coordinating our global delivery model, assets and internal processes with our clients’ interfirm transactions and relationships. We note that areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, developments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum computing and as-a-service solutions, all of which may materially affect the cost, deployment and use of technology by our clients and, in some cases, the nature of how we generate revenue when clients delay spending while evaluating new technologies. Our growth strategy focuses on driving innovation through strategic IT investments, technology deployment and alliance relationships with major software and platform providers, securing certified personnel with new technology skills, and reconfiguring IT resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to expand into new growth areas and maintain competitive advantage. We rely on increasingly complex information technology networks, systems and infrastructure to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate across locations with our people, clients, alliance partners and vendors, managing progress on systems-integration consulting services using cost-incurred-to-date metrics and providing ongoing, repeatable outsourcing services to run and manage client systems or business functions. We also highlight that our information management capability—our ability to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access—is critical to supporting business needs and that evolving cybersecurity threats, expanding data protection regulations (such as GDPR), utility outages, natural disasters, cyberattacks or emerging entrants offering more integrated solutions all increase the difficulty of maintaining effective IT governance, business continuity and disaster recovery plans, process optimization and risk management in our global operations.

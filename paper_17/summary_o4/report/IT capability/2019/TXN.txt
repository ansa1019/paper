We note exposures to possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate, including breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties that could be caused by computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance or human error and could compromise our information technology networks, result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of confidential or proprietary information, disrupt manufacturing and other operations or release personal data, thereby adversely affecting our operating results and reputation. Cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties are frequent and constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of defending against them. We also describe strategic investments in our digital infrastructure, including our web presence and global sales and applications team, which provide unique access and insight to about 100,000 customers designing TI semiconductors into their end products, and significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands and enhance our production processes. Our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders depends on forecasting customer demand based on multiple assumptions, and inaccurate forecasts may lead to inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce profit margins and adversely affect our financial condition. For our consignment arrangements with distributors, delivery occurs and revenue is recognized when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations, and we recognize revenue net of allowances—management’s estimates of future credits based on historical data and contractual terms—when revenue is recognized. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported, and we rely on third parties to supply goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner, where breaches in suppliers’ information technology systems could likewise result in unauthorized release of confidential or proprietary information.

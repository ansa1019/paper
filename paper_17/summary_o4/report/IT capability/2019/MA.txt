Mastercard’s business model centers on its proprietary global payments network, which connects issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments, digital partners and consumers by providing a multi-rail platform that authorizes, clears and settles electronic transactions and supports value-added offerings such as cyber and intelligence products, data analytics, consulting and information-management services. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential and proprietary information and technology in our computer systems and global network, as well as those of our third-party providers, to ensure safety and security and to deliver digital and mobile channel strategies, ACH and real-time account-based payment capabilities. We also work with technology companies that leverage our platforms to enhance payment security and deliver their services efficiently to consumers. Rapid and significant technological developments—including evolving standards in smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, blockchain, machine learning and AI—along with industry-wide solutions such as EMV and tokenization, intellectual property constraints and the challenge of attracting and retaining technology experts, may render our current solutions obsolete or inhibit our ability to adopt new services. The complexity of our real-time payment platform, designated as critical national infrastructure, requires careful management to address unique security vulnerabilities, ensure uptime and satisfy regulatory oversight, while service disruptions arising from technology malfunctions, telecommunications outages, third-party provider failures or cyber-attacks could materially impair transaction processing, damage our reputation and increase costs. To mitigate these risks, we maintain a business-continuity program and continue to invest in the development and enhancement of controls, processes and protective measures, recognizing that cyber-threats and ongoing digital-infrastructure demands are heightened by our scale, global presence and reliance on external relationships and future joint-venture and merger activities.

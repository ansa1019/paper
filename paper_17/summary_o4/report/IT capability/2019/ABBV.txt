AbbVie depends on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business and a failure or disruption of those systems could adversely affect its assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions; these systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown, and data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may result in the failure of critical business operations or expose sensitive data—including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners—to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie’s information technology systems that could impair its operational efficiency, market responsiveness or firm performance, potentially resulting in loss of revenue, legal, financial, reputational or business harm and substantial remediation costs. In addition, AbbVie’s coordination of its resources and pursuit of strategic objectives relies in part on third-party providers of information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services, and any inability of these third parties to meet their contractual obligations or maintain the integrity of IT infrastructure could disrupt AbbVie’s operations, weaken its connectivity and coordination capabilities, and impede its ability to deploy and leverage its technology-based resources in support of business needs.

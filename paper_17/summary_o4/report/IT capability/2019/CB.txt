Chubb’s disclosures emphasize its deep reliance on information technology and data analytics across underwriting, claims, distribution and other core processes, warning that a failure in its operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third-party service providers, including unauthorized access, malware or cyber-attacks, could disrupt business, damage its reputation and cause losses. The company states that its business “depends on effective information security and systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data our information systems use to run our business,” and that, despite administrative and technical controls, the expanding complexity of its security infrastructure may leave it vulnerable to security events. Chubb also notes that it uses “various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) and data analytics to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks,” and that these analytical outputs are central to its decision-making and competitive advantage, while acknowledging the limitations of assumptions and inputs. Chubb cautions that rapid technological advancements in the insurance and IT industries present competitive risks as market participants seek to increase transaction speeds, lower costs and create new opportunities, and that failing to keep pace with these technological changes and evolving data analytics could lead to a competitive disadvantage and limit its ability to compete in desired markets. In addition, Chubb highlights the growing burden of privacy, data security and cybersecurity regulations—including GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act and New York’s Department of Financial Services cybersecurity regulation—which “mandate detailed cybersecurity standards” and could increase compliance costs, risk of noncompliance and penalties. Finally, Chubb indicates it is “monitoring industry efforts via our external investment managers to transition away from LIBOR” by the end of 2021, reflecting its focus on adapting its technology and financial processes to changing market benchmarks.

We rely on advanced information technology networks and systems—including the Internet and numerous internally-developed applications—to coordinate and support a wide variety of critical business processes throughout our global operations, from receiving package-level data in advance of physical receipt to tracking shipments, planning and executing deliveries, processing billing and monitoring financial and operational metrics across franchised centers and acquired businesses. To enhance operational efficiency and competitive advantage, we continue to invest in automated facilities, transformation initiatives and the development of technology-enabled solutions and capitalized software projects that reduce manual touchpoints and streamline package sorting and delivery productivity. Our information management capability—collecting, storing and transmitting significant volumes of proprietary and sensitive data across national borders—is governed by an evolving regulatory environment, including GDPR and data-localization laws, which obliges us to maintain robust security protocols, contractual requirements and information technology risk management and disaster-recovery plans. We also depend on the IT networks of customers, franchisees, cloud service providers and third-party delivery services, each of which may introduce vulnerabilities to programming errors, hardware failures, cyber-attacks (including malware, ransomware and DDoS), human error and other catastrophic events. While we have invested heavily in technology security initiatives and continue to enhance our monitoring systems, protocols and disaster-recovery capabilities, we recognize that the increasing complexity and sophistication of global cyber threats may require substantial additional resources and that any breach, system disruption or failure to comply with data-protection regulations could materially disrupt operations, impair customer confidence, damage our reputation, invite regulatory scrutiny, impair our competitive positioning and result in litigation and financial loss.

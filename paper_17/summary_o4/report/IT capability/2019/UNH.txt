The company’s risk factor disclosures emphasize that failures to maintain, integrate, consolidate, upgrade or expand its information systems and technology products as intended could materially and adversely affect operations, financial position and cash flows. Its business is highly dependent on the integrity, timeliness and reliability of data, connectivity among technologies and advanced IT systems to implement innovative services, price products, serve customers efficiently and report results. Significant resources are committed to protecting, enhancing and developing systems to keep pace with evolving information processing technology, regulatory standards and customer preferences, yet software defects, third-party integration issues and unsuccessful platform transitions may disrupt operations and impede care management and cost estimation. Evolving federal, state, non-U.S. and industry regulations governing health data privacy and security—including GDPR, HIPAA and PCI DSS—may require system reconfiguration, increase compliance costs or constrain its ability to compete in the health information technology market. The threat of cyber-attacks or other security incidents against its IT infrastructure, vendors or facilities could lead to unauthorized disclosure or loss of protected personal, proprietary or confidential information, service interruptions, regulatory penalties, litigation, reputational harm and significant remediation costs. While the company maintains programs to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and provides ongoing employee training on cyber risks, the rapidly changing threat landscape and reliance on third-party vendors present persistent challenges, and any remediation efforts may not fully prevent interruptions, delays or breaches that could weaken its competitive position and its capacity to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships.

It also highlights the importance of effective access management and the secure collection, processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and personal information, and the need for robust training, procedures, backup systems and other safeguards to mitigate risks from cyber attacks, security breaches or technology failures of its own systems, those of third parties and the broader financial services infrastructure.

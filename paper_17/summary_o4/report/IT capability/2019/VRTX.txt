We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business, and in the course of our operations we collect, store and transmit confidential information—including personal health data and intellectual property—that must be secured to preserve confidentiality, integrity and availability. We disclose that the size and complexity of these systems make them potentially vulnerable to service interruptions, security breaches or failures due to software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attacks, employee misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or other events, any of which could result in loss of critical data, operational disruptions and exposure to private or governmental claims. Although we have implemented security measures and adopted a business continuity plan, we acknowledge that cyber-attacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and have become more difficult to detect, and our liability insurance may not be sufficient to cover claims arising from security breaches, cyber-attacks or related liabilities. We further note that we are subject to a wide range of evolving domestic and international privacy, data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations—including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, Brazil’s LGPD, HIPAA-related requirements and various state breach notification and health information privacy laws—which impose significant compliance obligations and carry the risk of substantial fines, penalties or criminal sanctions for non-compliance. Compliance with these laws requires significant ongoing resources and remains subject to varied interpretations by courts and regulatory agencies, creating uncertainty and potential reputational harm. We also highlight risks arising from third-party publication and analysis of our clinical trial data under EMA policies, which could lead to patient confidentiality breaches and disclosure of competitively sensitive information, as well as the evolving use of social media by patients and employees, which could trigger reporting obligations, loss of trade secrets or other proprietary information and public disclosure of protected personal data, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and reputation.

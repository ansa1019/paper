Danaher relies on information technology systems—some managed by third parties—to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential business data and personally identifiable information relating to employees, customers, partners and patients, and to execute and support a wide array of critical business processes and activities such as order entry and fulfillment, billing, payments, shipping, service and contractual obligations. Portions of Danaher’s remote monitoring products and services incorporate embedded software and IT infrastructure, and certain products or software sold to customers connect to Danaher’s systems for maintenance or other purposes. The company acknowledges that attacks by hackers, malicious code, ransomware, human error, power or hardware failures, telecom or utility outages, catastrophes or other unforeseen events—whether targeting Danaher’s own systems, products in the field or third-party systems on which it depends—could result in misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, product malfunctions, patient safety risks, business interruption and reputational harm. Danaher’s disaster-recovery planning and system redundancy may prove ineffective or inadequate to fully mitigate such disruptions. As a global enterprise, Danaher is subject to extensive and evolving data protection and security laws, including U.S. HIPAA requirements, the EU’s GDPR, local national data residency rules and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and any violation, or perceived violation, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, shareholder litigation, increased compliance costs, reputational damage and adverse effects on its operations and financial statements.

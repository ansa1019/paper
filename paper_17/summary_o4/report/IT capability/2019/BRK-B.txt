Competition and technological changes may erode our business franchises and prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Terrorist acts could produce significant losses through the destruction of production facilities and information systems. Data privacy regulations recently enacted in various jurisdictions address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities, and failure to comply could result in reputational damage and significant penalties. We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business, and certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks, which we expect to become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. If we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential customer and employee information, and political, economic, social or financial market instability or interference from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or materially adverse effects in ways that cannot be predicted at this time, any of which could materially affect our consolidated financial results.

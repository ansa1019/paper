During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. Transportation, communication, demand, information technology, or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control, such as strikes, acts of God, wars, terrorist activities, and natural or man-made disasters, may materially affect our operations. Certain critical information systems that we rely on for the operation of our business and the products we sell are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents. We maintain and rely upon telecommunications, the Internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications (some integrated into our products or required to provide our services), network communications, email and third-party or cloud-based SaaS products for important business functions, which may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers or other third parties. All of these information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure from sources including mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors, phishing schemes and other third-party attacks, degradation or loss of service or access due to viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, or physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, or networking equipment. Although we have implemented ISO 27001-compliant security procedures, virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access controls, and emergency recovery processes, and carefully select our third-party providers of information systems to mitigate these risks, those mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cyber-related incidents that could result in loss or inaccessibility of confidential and/or sensitive information; disruption of the proper function of our products, services, or operations; the failure of our or our customers’ manufacturing processes; errors in the output of our work or our customers’ work; loss or public exposure of personal information; public release of customer orders, financial and business plans, and operational results; exposure to claims from third parties; misappropriation or theft of our or a customer’s assets or resources; diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; or our failure to meet, or violation of, regulatory or other legal obligations.

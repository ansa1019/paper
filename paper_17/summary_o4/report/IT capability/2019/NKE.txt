Nike’s disclosures highlight difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining its increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control, as well as interruptions in data and information technology systems and consumer data security; the company warns that if the technology-based systems that give consumers the ability to shop online do not function effectively, its operating results and ability to grow its digital commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected; risks specific to digital commerce also include diversion of sales from brick-and-mortar to digital channels, difficulty recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Nike is subject to data security and privacy risks in handling transactional and personal information about customers and users of its digital experiences, including online distribution channels, adaptive products and personal fitness applications, as hackers and data thieves become increasingly sophisticated. The company relies significantly on information technology systems and networks—including the internet and third-party services—across its supply chain (product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution), as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities, and it has implemented IT systems in all geographic regions with ongoing work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes. Information technology systems are critical to many operating activities and business processes, and the failure of these systems to operate effectively—due to security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or problems with transitions to upgraded or replacement systems—could cause delays in product fulfillment, reduced efficiency, delays in reporting financial results, lost revenues, reputational damage and significant remediation costs. Nike also depends on IT systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and marketing its digital products and services, and it relies on electronic communications with employees, customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers; any interruption to IT systems may impede its ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, reputational harm and loss of users. In its management’s discussion and analysis, Nike states that its Nike Direct operations have required substantial fixed investment in equipment, information systems and personnel and that it will continue to invest in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms and a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate an end-to-end digital transformation.

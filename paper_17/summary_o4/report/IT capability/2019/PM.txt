The company discloses that it relies on information systems to manage business processes, collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, consumers and customers, including systems managed by third-party service providers, and that it maintains backup systems and business-continuity plans to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access. It warns that the failure of these systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes could place the company at a competitive disadvantage, result in loss of revenue, assets or sensitive data, lead to litigation and regulatory action, damage the company’s and its brands’ reputations and give rise to significant remediation and other costs. The company further cautions that failure to protect personal data, respect the rights of data subjects and adhere to strict cybersecurity protocols under regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation could subject it to substantial fines and legal challenges, and it notes that as it increasingly relies on digital platforms, the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase. Finally, the company acknowledges that the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about its reduced-risk products.

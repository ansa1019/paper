The company’s risk disclosures emphasize that its IT capability—encompassing the coordination and deployment of information technology systems, data and analytics in support of its business processes, strategic initiatives and interfirm relationships—is a critical competitive resource whose failure or underdevelopment could materially impair operational performance and growth. It warns that an inability to develop and implement technology improvements or to respond effectively to digital disruption and technological change, including artificial intelligence, mobile and cloud services, open source software, Internet of Things, robotics and blockchain, could negatively affect results. The firm depends heavily on the effectiveness, security and continuity of complex IT systems and networks to conduct its business, manage and share sensitive electronic information with vendors and third parties, and support cost-efficient, increasingly digital processes, and it has undertaken strategic investments and partnerships in technology infrastructure to undergird its growth strategy. It highlights the need for continual updating, patching and upgrading of aging systems to address known vulnerabilities and evolving cybersecurity threats—from malware, ransomware and phishing to advanced persistent threats—and the challenges of deploying safeguards such as data encryption, multi-factor authentication and enhanced monitoring globally. The company also notes its reliance on key vendors and the complexity of integrating acquired entities’ information systems, such as those of JLT, which may expose it to unexpected vulnerabilities or regulatory compliance issues under GDPR, the CCPA and other data protection regimes. These disclosures underscore the importance of mobilizing and reconfiguring IT resources, governance practices, personnel capabilities and organizational processes to enable business innovation, maintain competitive advantage, ensure regulatory compliance and safeguard client and company data.

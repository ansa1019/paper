The company discloses that it relies extensively on information technology to process transactions, compile results and manage its business, stressing the importance of maintaining uninterrupted operation of business-critical systems, including primary and back-up systems subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and employee error; it warns that failure to adequately update existing systems or implement new systems or disruptions arising from significant system changes could harm operations or erode competitive position and that investments to improve critical information systems and processing capabilities require careful monitoring, appropriate pacing and robust change-management processes to mitigate risks of excessive technological change, poor investment choices or implementation problems that may delay or reduce anticipated benefits; the company further acknowledges a previously identified material weakness in its information technology general controls over user access and program change-management for systems supporting financial reporting, reports completion of remediation measures without assurance that controls will continue to operate effectively, and emphasizes its reliance on technology for omnichannel retailing and member-facing mobile and web applications, payment transaction processing and compliance with evolving data security standards such as PCI DSS, noting that breaches or inadequate security measures could damage reputation, result in litigation, require significant additional resources and disrupt operations.

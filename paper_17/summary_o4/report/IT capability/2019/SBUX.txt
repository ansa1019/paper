Starbucks discloses that many of its information technology systems—and those of its licensees and other third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers—including point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services, rewards programs and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other customer and employee data as well as Starbucks proprietary and confidential business information, and that unauthorized access, use, theft, destruction or other compromises of that data through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods could result in material losses of revenues, adverse impacts to its reputation and brand, and exposure to civil or criminal liability under U.S. and international privacy and cybersecurity laws such as the GDPR and CCPA. The company emphasizes that it relies heavily on information technology systems across its operations for numerous purposes—including administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in stores and online, supply chain management, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services and mobile technology such as ordering apps, mobile payments, reloads and loyalty functionality—and that many of these systems are interdependent; any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach—whether caused by power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, network failures, ineffective redundancy, upgrade issues, software flaws, user error or system security breaches—could interrupt operations, negatively affect product availability, sales and operational efficiency, and require significant unplanned expenditures to remediate. Starbucks further states that “we continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss,” and acknowledges that the success of strategic initiatives—such as driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities and increasing digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend—is highly dependent on its IT architecture and digital infrastructure, while failures in incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans could have material negative impacts on its operations and financial results.

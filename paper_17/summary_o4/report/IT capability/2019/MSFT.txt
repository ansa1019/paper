Competition in the technology sector is described as hinging on rapidly evolving and disruptive digital technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent new product introductions, underscoring the firm’s emphasis on making innovative products, devices, and services; cultivating platform-based ecosystems that generate network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider; and establishing the scale necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. The report highlights our strategic transition to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service models and the substantial investments we are making in research, development, and marketing to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence. We devote significant resources to develop and deploy cloud-based strategies, maintain and expand global datacenter and network infrastructure to ensure compatibility, reliability, and performance across a growing array of devices and endpoints, and continuously engineer more secure products and services by enhancing security and reliability features, improving the deployment of software updates, developing mitigation technologies, and maintaining the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services. Our internal IT environment is characterized by early adoption of new devices and consumer-oriented technologies for data sharing and communication, and we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability, eliminate obstacles to innovation, increase commercial sales capacity, and enhance third-party developer engagement. The growth of the Internet of Things has led us to develop multilayered hardware, sensors, firmware, and software solutions that collect and manage large volumes of data under stringent security, privacy, and regulatory requirements, while our integration of artificial intelligence scenarios raises considerations of algorithmic accuracy, data bias, and ethical implications. We continue to make significant investments and acquisitions—such as GitHub and LinkedIn—to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources and capabilities; integrate business systems and human resources; manage supply-chain constraints for critical hardware components; protect source code and intellectual property; and comply with evolving competition, intellectual property, data privacy, and cybersecurity regulations worldwide. These disclosures collectively illustrate our IT capability as the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources in combination with other organizational assets and capabilities to support and enhance business strategies, internal processes, interfirm transactions, and sustained competitive advantage.

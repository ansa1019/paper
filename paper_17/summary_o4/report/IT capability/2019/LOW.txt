Our interactions with customers have evolved into an omni-channel experience as they increasingly use computers, tablets, mobile phones and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback about all aspects of our business, and omni-channel retail is quickly evolving such that we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors; accordingly, our customer-facing technology systems must appeal to our customers, function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience. To support our strategic initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement them, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals, and failure to do so or to provide a consistent experience across sales channels could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or business prospects. Our business and reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer, employee, vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations governing our obligation to protect our systems, assets and such information; cyber-attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission-critical systems are constantly evolving, and despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security, we and our third-party service providers cannot guarantee that we can adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach, which could result in loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to business operations while remediation is underway. As customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omni-channel sales and marketing strategy, performance issues including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service, ransomware or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, could destroy the positive benefits they provide and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of Lowe’s as a reliable online vendor. Our efforts to provide an omni-channel experience include investing in, maintaining and making ongoing improvements to our existing management information systems that support operations such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment, but these systems are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks and telecommunications failures, and we continually make investments in our systems that may introduce disruption; if our management information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems, our financial performance could be adversely affected.

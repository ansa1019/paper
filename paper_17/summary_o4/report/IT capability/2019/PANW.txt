Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products and subscriptions, and to manage any future growth effectively we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner, yet we may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner, our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud, and we may experience difficulties in managing such improvements or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us. we have pioneered the next generation of security through our innovative platform that empowers enterprises, service providers, and government entities to secure their organizations by safely enabling applications and data running in their networks, on their endpoints, and in the cloud, and by preventing breaches that stem from targeted cyberattacks; our platform uses an innovative traffic classification engine that identifies network traffic by application, user, and content and provides consistent security across the network, endpoint, and cloud, thereby enabling transformative digital initiatives, including public cloud and mobility, while maintaining the visibility and control needed to protect critical data and control systems. we must continually change our products and expand our business strategy in response to changes in network infrastructure requirements, including the expanding use of cloud computing, and in 2019 we announced new cloud security offerings for securing access to the cloud and securing the future of security operations using an integrated ai-based continuous security platform with applications and services. our future plans include significant investments in research and development and related product and subscription opportunities, but developing our products, subscriptions, platform features, and related enhancements is expensive, involves lengthy and uncertain timetables between releases, requires the commitment of significant resources before we know whether our investments will result in market-accepted offerings, and entails the risk that new offerings may not achieve the anticipated benefits or return on investment.

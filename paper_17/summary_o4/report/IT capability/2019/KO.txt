The company discloses that it relies on networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third‐party hosted services, to support a wide range of business processes—procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collections, employee processes, consumer marketing, mergers and acquisitions, research and development and the processing of financial information for internal reporting and regulatory compliance—and that it depends on these information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among its global locations, bottlers, customers, suppliers and consumers. Because information systems are critical to the company’s operating activities, it maintains an information risk management program supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross‐functional committee, invests in personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of company personnel, and regularly prepares reports on emerging risks and strategies to address them for presentation to senior management and the audit committee. The company recognizes the digital evolution’s impact on consumer behavior and retail landscapes—rapid growth of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and platforms—and has made digitizing the Coca-Cola system a top priority, seeking to create more relevant and personalized consumer experiences in both digital and physical environments; to develop powerful digital tools and capabilities for retail customers; and to digitize operations through data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. It cautions that failures to protect against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or security breaches could disrupt operations, delay financial reporting, risk unauthorized or accidental disclosure of confidential or regulated personal data, expose the company to data privacy laws and regulatory actions under regimes such as the GDPR and CCPA, and result in financial losses, reputational damage and impaired ability to manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments, while inadequate compliance with personal data protection and privacy laws, or failure to achieve digital transformation initiatives, may negatively affect sales, productivity and overall financial performance.

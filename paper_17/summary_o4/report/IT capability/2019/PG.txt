Disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results as our ability to meet customer needs and achieve cost targets depends on maintaining key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and sole supplier or plant arrangements, and the loss or disruption of such arrangements, including discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, could interrupt product supply. An information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes or associated sites owned or operated by the company or its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. As part of the company’s regular review of potential risks, we maintain an information and operational technology (“IT/OT”) risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross‐functional stakeholders, and analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management, the audit committee and the board of directors. We rely extensively on IT/OT systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT/OT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, marketing and selling products, collecting, transferring, storing and processing stakeholder information and personal data (including data covered by privacy and data regulations such as the GDPR), summarizing and reporting results of operations (including financial reporting), managing banking and cash liquidity systems, hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information, collaborating via online global business communications, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, providing data security and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and critical business operations. As cybersecurity threats evolve in sophistication and prevalence globally, the company is continually increasing its attention to these threats, assessing potential threats and vulnerabilities and making investments to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updates of networks and systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training and updating security policies for the company and its third‐party providers. However, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber‐attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after an attack. Our IT/OT databases and systems and those of our third‐party providers have been, and may continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber‐attacks, and if such systems or technologies do not function properly or expose us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity loss issues. Further, if the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third‐party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information for any number of causes—from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance—and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to these items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and adversely impact our results.

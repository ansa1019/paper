We have architected our software and computer systems to utilize third-party “cloud” computing services, primarily running the vast majority of our processing on Amazon Web Services, and have built and deployed our own global content-delivery network (“Open Connect”) to efficiently stream high volumes of content to members’ internet-connected devices. We rely upon a combination of proprietary and third-party technology—including recommendation and merchandising systems, user-interface testing and modification tools, payment processing platforms and device integration protocols—to acquire, deploy and reconfigure resources in support of our streaming service. The reliable performance, security and scalability of our internal systems and those of our providers are critical to our ability to deliver service; any significant disruption, software error, capacity constraint or unauthorized access could degrade service, expose member or corporate data, impair content delivery and adversely affect member acquisition, retention and business performance. We have implemented encryption, authentication, monitoring and other cybersecurity controls to protect data confidentiality, integrity and availability, but acknowledge that evolving attack techniques and increasing regulatory requirements—such as GDPR, CCPA and varying international data localization or export restrictions—can impose additional operational costs and may require ongoing adjustments to our infrastructure, processes and governance practices. Furthermore, our agreements with cable, satellite and telecommunications operators and with consumer-electronics manufacturers depend on partners’ device updates, network interoperability and regulatory frameworks (for example, net-neutrality rules and usage-based pricing), any of which could impede connectivity, limit our operational flexibility and constrain our firm’s capability to support and enhance our business strategies.

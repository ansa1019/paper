The company’s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions, and system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, with the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning potentially insufficient for all eventualities, such failures or disruptions being capable of preventing access to the company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company’s products. There may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data, but these measures cannot provide absolute security and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results. For example, the company may experience a security breach impacting its information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. The company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies, yet these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities, and third parties fraudulently inducing employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the company’s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the company, the company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the company’s products and services. In addition to risks relating to general confidential information, the company is subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data, and health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, which can subject the company to audit by governmental authorities. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised or the company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, it could incur significant investigatory expenses, fees or fines and lose the ability to process payment cards, which would materially adversely affect the company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results, and while the company maintains insurance coverage intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection, including laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information, which may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and continue to develop, potentially causing the company to incur substantial costs or require changes to its business practices, with noncompliance or failure to comply with public statements and policies exposing the company to governmental proceedings, ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. Some third-party content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions, and if requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions, with no assurance such solutions can be obtained at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.

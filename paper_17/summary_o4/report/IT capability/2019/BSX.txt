In discussing our integration of acquired businesses, we note that coordinating information technologies alongside research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance has been critical; in support of end-to-end business process streamlining and automation, we have expanded global shared services and robotic process utilization and optimized our supply chain network to maximize manufacturing and distribution capacity. We rely on comprehensive information technology systems, including third-party vendor platforms, to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, which requires an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and to develop new systems in order to keep pace with evolving information processing technologies, regulatory standards, the need to safeguard patient and customer data and changing customer patterns. Our reliance on these systems underlies our efforts to ensure data accuracy, connectivity and access, to automate and redesign work processes, to support strategic decision-making and to improve operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. We have also established formal controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level issues—including cybersecurity matters—to senior management and the board, ensuring timely identification, response and mitigation of risks and enabling the coordinated deployment of technology resources in support of our business strategies, regulatory compliance and continuity of critical business functions.

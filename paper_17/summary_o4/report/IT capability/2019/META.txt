Facebook Inc. discloses that its cost of revenue primarily reflects the expenses of operating and scaling its data centers and technical infrastructure—such as facility and server equipment depreciation, energy, bandwidth, and colocation costs—to support its extensive user base and advertising delivery, and that these systems rely heavily on interoperability with third-party mobile operating systems, networks, browsers, and standards over which the company has limited control. The company warns that changes, bugs, or technical issues in external platforms or in its own internally and third-party-developed software and hardware may degrade functionality, impede access, disrupt ad delivery, or compromise its ability to target and measure advertising effectiveness—a vulnerability illustrated by the September 2018 code flaw that exposed user access tokens. Facebook also acknowledges that a substantial portion of its network infrastructure is outsourced to third parties, increasing its exposure to service interruptions, capacity constraints, and supply-chain or geopolitical delays, and that unanticipated challenges in its multi-location data-center expansion projects can lead to cost overruns, operational inefficiencies, or interruptions in user experience. The company further explains that its key user and ad performance metrics depend on complex algorithms, machine-learning models, data signals (including device and IP information), and periodic user surveys—all of which carry statistical variances and may be affected by encryption (notably in WhatsApp), evolving methodologies, and regulatory or browser-driven restrictions on data access (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Finally, it highlights that its payments infrastructure similarly depends on robust technology systems, regulatory licenses, and secure information management to process transactions and guard against security breaches, any of which, if compromised, could materially harm its operations, revenue, and reputation.

Our risk disclosures highlight that a failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business, given our extensive reliance on information technology systems to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data—including sales, customer and associate data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing and order fulfillment—and that for these systems to operate effectively we or our third-party service providers must maintain and update them despite exposure to power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, catastrophic events and user errors. We are currently making, and expect to continue making, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and third-party service providers, by replacing existing systems with successor systems; outsourcing certain technology; migrating applications to the cloud; or designing or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with enhanced functionality to support our store, interconnected retail, supply chain and technology initiatives. These initiatives—designed to streamline operations, simplify customer interactions, provide a more interconnected retail and digital experience across multiple online channels and create the fastest, most efficient delivery network—require significant investment in operations, processes, systems, support and information technology personnel and may involve implementation delays, cost overruns, operational disruptions or failure to realize anticipated benefits. Disruptions, delays or performance issues with our customer-facing technology systems and digital platforms could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences, even as we continually seek to enhance our online communities, knowledge centers and user interfaces. To maintain the privacy and security of customer, associate, supplier and company information, we have implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes and procedures to address evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks, although no guarantee exists that these measures will be adequate. Online sales, driven through our digital platforms for in-store pickup or delivery, represented 9.3% of net sales and grew 19.4% during fiscal 2019, underscoring the critical role of our information technology capabilities in supporting business strategies, work processes and an interconnected retail experience.

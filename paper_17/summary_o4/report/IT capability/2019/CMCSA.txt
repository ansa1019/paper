Comcast’s disclosures emphasize that its businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments and underscore the importance of mobilizing, deploying and leveraging IT‐based resources in support of evolving business needs, including advanced fiber‐based networks, rapidly evolving 4G and 5G wireless broadband services, X1 and Sky Q platforms, cloud DVR technology, Flex set‐top boxes, OTT offerings and wireless gateways with xFi-enabled in‐and‐out‐of‐home Wi-Fi management capabilities. The company states its success is contingent upon its ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies to coordinate internal assets and processes and support interfirm transactions and relationships, while noting that failures or delays in technology initiatives—such as choosing less effective equipment, failing to employ desirable technologies ahead of competitors or inadequately executing network, software or customer‐premise deployments—could adversely affect its businesses and results of operations. Comcast highlights its reliance on network and information systems for network management, customer service operations, programming delivery and digital advertising platforms and warns that process breakdowns, software and hardware vulnerabilities, security architecture or design flaws, cyber attacks, natural disasters or third-party vendor disruptions could degrade or interrupt its products and services, compromise confidential or proprietary information and require significant capital and operational resources to remedy. To mitigate these risks, Comcast develops and maintains extensive security programs, conducts ongoing system monitoring and updates, obtains assurances from key vendors supplying critical hardware, software and operational support, and relies on intellectual property licenses to use various technologies. Capital expenditures reflect continued investment in scalable infrastructure, customer premise equipment and network capacity to support high-speed internet, video, voice and business services, and strategic resource allocation is guided by competitive market dynamics, consumer behavior shifts and the imperative to execute technology initiatives effectively.

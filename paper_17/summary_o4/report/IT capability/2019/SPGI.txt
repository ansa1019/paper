Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, including cloud infrastructure, and we devote significant resources and make substantial capital investments in information technology data centers, software, networks and other technology initiatives—such as modernizing the workplace, standardizing and simplifying our IT architecture, augmenting shared data processes and advancing risk, internal control and compliance frameworks—to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of our systems, support key product and service offerings and enable rapid electronic delivery of substantial data volumes, while recognizing that cyber threats are rapidly evolving, that breaches, unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, malware, system failures, data corruption, network disruptions, physical or technical infrastructure outages—whether caused by human error, natural disaster, terrorism or third-party vendor failures—could interrupt our operations, compromise material information, harm our reputation, result in litigation or regulatory actions, and lead to loss of customer confidence; we also acknowledge that ongoing investment in new offerings, enhancements, enterprise-wide software licensing and maintenance, process automation, change management and disaster recovery is required to innovate, coordinate and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities, to comply with expanding global privacy, cybersecurity and data protection regulations, and to maintain competitive agility, but we cannot assure that such investments will achieve their intended performance gains, support our business strategies or fully mitigate the operational, regulatory and financial risks associated with technology deployment and infrastructure continuity.

Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems to support both its infrastructure and product offerings and maintains protected personal data whose security and confidentiality are subject to regional and local data protection laws that may restrict cross-border data transfers. Because of the size and complexity of these systems, they are susceptible to cyber attacks, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruptions that could increase costs and expenses, impair product functionality, damage customer relations, reduce revenue and expose Abbott to legal or regulatory penalties. Abbott collects, manages and processes protected health and other personal information in connection with certain medical products and services and invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce such risks. As part of its ongoing information management capability, the company monitors its systems continuously for current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment and includes investments in information technology in its capital expenditure program. Despite these efforts, no assurance can be given that future attacks, breaches or related product issues will not occur or that they will not have a material adverse effect on Abbottâ€™s business.

The disclosure describes the company’s capital expenditures, which include significant investments in data centers, corporate facilities, and infrastructure encompassing information systems hardware, software, and enhancements. Although the text primarily focuses on hardware design, manufacturing, and distribution, the inclusion of these IT-related investments suggests that the firm is allocating resources to bolster its information systems capability. These investments imply an effort to support and enhance both operational processes and digital channels (such as the iTunes Store), thereby aligning with the broader concept of IT capability—namely, the firm’s competence in deploying and integrating IT resources to support business strategies, coordinate internal processes, and foster competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment.

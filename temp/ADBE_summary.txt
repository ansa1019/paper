In fiscal 2013, we integrated Neolane and Behance into our digital marketing and digital media reportable segments, respectively, demonstrating the coordination of acquired technology resources and interdivisional processes; Creative Cloud, first delivered in May 2012, is our next-generation subscription-based platform superseding perpetual licenses by providing more frequent product updates, cloud storage and access with file syncing across devices, community-based features and services via the Behance acquisition, app creation capabilities and lower entry pricing, and is offered for individuals, teams and enterprises under term license agreements (ETLAs), thereby transforming our business model to recurring, ratable and predictable revenue streams; we continue to implement strategies to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions by increasing value for users, targeted promotions and exclusive product innovations to subscribers; cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including data center costs, depreciation of computer equipment and salaries of network operations and technical support personnel, and data center costs increased primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services while depreciation expense rose owing to capital investments in network and data center infrastructure to support business growth; our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which includes six solutions such as Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Campaign acquired through Neolane, has seen increased adoption of term-based licensing with ratable revenue recognition, resulting in larger engagements, more predictable revenue and higher long-term growth; subscription revenue rose to 50% of total revenue in fiscal 2014 from 28% in fiscal 2013 and 15% in fiscal 2012 as we have transitioned more of our business to subscription and SaaS models, which we expect will further increase recurring revenue and support enhanced operational flexibility; total deferred revenue of $1.16 billion at November 28, 2014 grew by $326.5 million primarily from Creative Cloud subscriptions and ETLAs and digital marketing cloud services, and unbilled deferred revenue backlog represents committed future billings under existing subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements, reflecting the mobilization of IT-based resources in support of business strategies and work processes.

Apple’s MD&A highlights the firm’s evolving digital and information technology capabilities, from designing, manufacturing and marketing mobile communication and media devices and personal computers to selling a variety of related software, services, accessories and networking solutions through its retail and online channels. The company’s growth in net sales from the iTunes store, App Store and related in-app purchases reflects its ability to leverage its installed base of iOS devices to deliver timely, reliable and secure digital content, while its continued investments in research and development—driven by increased headcount, share-based compensation costs and machinery and equipment—support the development of new software functionalities and enhanced product offerings. Capital expenditures of $10.5 billion in 2014, including product tooling, manufacturing process equipment, data centers and information systems hardware, software and enhancements, demonstrate the firm’s commitment to deploying and reconfiguring technology resources and infrastructure in support of its business strategies and operational flexibility. Moreover, strategic supplier arrangements, including inventory component prepayments and outsourcing partnerships, underscore Apple’s coordination of internal processes and resource integration to manage production, and its use of financial instruments such as interest rate swaps evidences a governance framework for mitigating risk in its technology-enabled revenue and investment activities.

The report contains several references that, while not explicitly using the term “IT capability,” imply that the company is leveraging evolving technology resources and digital infrastructure to achieve competitive differentiation and operational transformation. For example, the integration of acquired businesses such as Neolane, Behance, and Efficient Frontier into its digital marketing and digital media segments highlights an organizational focus on deploying advanced digital tools and platforms to enhance customer engagement and service delivery. The transition from perpetual licensing to cloud-based subscription models (evident in the Creative Cloud offering and Acrobat Cloud services) suggests a shift toward technology-enabled business processes and greater operational flexibility, while increases in hosting, server expenditures, and investments in data center infrastructure further point to strategic resource allocation for improved network connectivity and IT systems performance. These initiatives indicate efforts to coordinate and deploy both tangible and intangible technology resources that support business innovation, robust digital service delivery, and data-driven decision-making, all of which are consistent with evolving IT capabilities that strengthen the firm’s competitive positioning in the market.

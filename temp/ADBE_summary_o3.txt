The report reflects elements that indirectly relate to IT capability through its emphasis on investments and acquisitions aimed at enhancing digital and technology-enabled operations. For example, the acquisitions of privately held companies such as neolane, behance, and efficient frontier are highlighted as strategic moves to incorporate advanced digital marketing, cross‚Äêchannel campaign management, and digital ad buying technologies that are integrated into the firm's digital media and marketing segments. The transition from perpetual licensing to a subscription-based model, particularly with offerings like creative cloud, suggests an ongoing transformation where service delivery increasingly relies on robust technology infrastructures, including investments in data centers and network operations, to support recurring revenue and timely product updates. These developments demonstrate a focus on deploying IT resources and digital capabilities intended to optimize business processes, enhance operational flexibility, and fortify competitive positioning, which indirectly aligns with the evolving concept of IT capability as the coordination and integration of technology with other organizational resources.

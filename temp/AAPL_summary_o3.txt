The report does not feature an explicit discussion of “IT capability” in the detailed sense of coordinating a firm’s assets, processes, and interfirm relationships; however, it does reference several elements that plausibly relate to the concept. Specifically, the disclosure notes capital expenditures for 2015, which include investments in corporate facilities and infrastructure, as well as information systems hardware, software, and enhancements, thereby suggesting a commitment to maintaining and upgrading the technological backbone that supports operational efficiency and business strategy. Furthermore, the discussion of increased research and development expenditures—attributed to higher headcount, share-based compensation, and investments in machinery and equipment—implicitly supports the broader notion of enhancing the firm’s technological capabilities to drive innovation and respond to changing market dynamics. Although these references are primarily framed in the context of financial performance, product innovation, and competitive market positioning, they indicate that the company continues to allocate resources to and deploy IT-based resources in ways that support, and potentially transform, its business processes and overall competitive strength.

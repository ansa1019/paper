In fiscal 2014, we continued to evolve and deploy our IT capability through the delivery and expansion of our cloud-based Creative Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud services, leveraging our network infrastructure—including data center operations, computer equipment and specialized personnel in network operations, implementation, account management and technical support—to provide subscription-based SaaS offerings with ratable revenue recognition, more predictable recurring cash flows and enhanced operational flexibility; Creative Cloud, first delivered in May 2012, supersedes our historical perpetual-license model by offering frequent product updates, cloud storage with file syncing across user machines, community features via the Behance integration, app creation capabilities and lower entry pricing, which has transformed our business model by expanding our customer base, maintaining users on current releases and increasing market agility; our Adobe Marketing Cloud, augmented by the Neolane-embedded cross-channel campaign management and Efficient Frontier optimization technologies, has shifted significantly from on-premise perpetual license revenue to term-based ratable subscriptions—reaching approximately 75% term-based contracts for AEM and Adobe Campaign in fiscal 2014—thereby driving larger customer engagements, more predictable revenue, higher long-term growth and a competitive digital infrastructure; we recognize our information management capability in providing data and information with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access, tailoring these in response to changing business needs and directions, and we invest in network and data center expansion, computer systems for research, sales, marketing and administration, and capital expenditures to scale our IT systems, underpin organizational integration and support strategic resource allocation; performance metrics such as paid subscriptions, annualized recurring revenue (ARR) and deferred revenue provide insight into the health of our digital media and marketing segments and guide our investment decisions; and our ongoing migration toward SaaS and subscription models underscores the core value of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to achieve competitive advantage, drive business transformation and enhance firm performance in dynamic market environments.

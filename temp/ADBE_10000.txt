The disclosures indirectly reveal that the company is leveraging a range of IT-enabled capabilities to support its evolving business model and competitive positioning. In particular, the integration of digital platforms arising from acquisitions—such as a cross‐channel campaign management technology provider, a specialized social media platform, and a multi‐channel digital ad buying optimization company—illustrates an effort to coordinate advanced technology resources with internal processes and external market transactions. The shift toward subscription-based revenue, exemplified by offerings like creative cloud that deliver continuous updates, cloud storage, and enhanced connectivity for users, further underscores a transformation that relies on digital technologies to support recurring service delivery and operational flexibility. These actions imply the deployment and coordination of IT resources and infrastructures to align with broader business strategies, optimize process performance, and generate long-term revenues in a dynamic market environment.

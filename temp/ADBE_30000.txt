The disclosures include several references that plausibly relate to the evolution and deployment of IT capability. For example, the company’s acquisitions of technology-oriented businesses—including a digital ad buying and optimization firm, a cross‐channel campaign management platform, and an online creative social media platform—are integrated into distinct reportable segments, which suggests an emphasis on leveraging digital technologies and IT resources to support business strategies. Additionally, the shift from perpetual licensing to a subscription-based model for offerings like creative cloud and digital marketing cloud implies an underlying IT architecture and network infrastructure that support hosted services, data center operations, and enhanced connectivity for delivering innovative digital products. Furthermore, the discussion of increased investments in network infrastructure, elevated data center costs due to higher transaction volumes, and increased capital expenditures on technology to support these cloud services indicates that the firm is actively deploying and mobilizing IT resources to drive operational flexibility, business innovation, and digital transformation. These elements together imply an evolving IT capability focused on integrating software development, digital resource management, and operational enhancements to support competitive positioning and improve business process effectiveness.

The company designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications; these products are distributed worldwide through the company’s retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers, and the company also offers third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible application software and accessories via its online and retail channels. The company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance and allocates revenue to undelivered software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the company’s best estimates of selling price, deferring such revenue and recognizing it on a straight-line basis over the period such services are expected to be provided, generally two to four years. Growth in net sales from the iTunes Store was driven by increases in revenue from App Store sales reflecting continued growth in the installed base of iOS devices and the expanded offerings of iOS apps and related in-app purchases, partially offset by a decline in digital music sales. In fiscal 2015, the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $13.0 billion, including approximately $600 million for retail store facilities and approximately $12.4 billion for other capital expenditures, which include product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, data centers and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements. The company’s other obligations include commitments to acquire capital assets such as product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and commitments related to advertising, research and development, internet and telecommunications services.

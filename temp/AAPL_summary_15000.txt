The company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance, and recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products, sales of software upgrades and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing essential software elements and/or undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices, using a hierarchy of vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value, third-party evidence of selling price and best estimate of selling price. For sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the company provides future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge and various non-software services, for which revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated two- to four-year period the upgrades and services are expected to be provided. The company’s process for determining its best estimates of selling price involves management judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time, and should future facts and circumstances change, the company’s estimates and the future rate of related amortization could change. The company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs—if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses—and also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company’s historical experience. Net sales of iTunes, software and services grew primarily due to increased revenue from the iTunes Store, AppleCare and licensing; the iTunes Store generated a total of $10.2 billion in net sales during 2014 compared to $9.3 billion during 2013, with growth driven by increases in revenue from App Store sales reflecting continued growth in the installed base of iOS devices and the expanded offerings of iOS apps and related in-app purchases. Research and development expense increased 35 percent in 2014 and 32 percent in 2013, driven primarily by increases in headcount and related expenses, including share-based compensation costs and machinery and equipment to support expanded R&D activities; the company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to its core business strategy and therefore expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. Capital expenditures were $11.0 billion during 2014, consisting of $491 million for retail store facilities and $10.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and other corporate facilities and infrastructure; the company anticipates utilizing approximately $13.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2015, including approximately $600 million for retail store facilities and approximately $12.4 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, data centers and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements.

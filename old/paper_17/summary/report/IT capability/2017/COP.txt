We focus on financial returns, which is a core aspect of our value proposition, aiming to achieve strong financial returns by controlling costs and exercising capital discipline. The exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry, where we compete with private, public, and state-owned companies to locate and obtain new sources of supply and produce oil and gas efficiently. Our strategy includes optimizing our portfolio by focusing on low cost-of-supply projects that strategically fit our development plans, which involves leveraging technology and knowledge to create value and safely deliver on our plans. We continue to evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations, enabling us to economically convert additional resources to reserves, achieve greater operating efficiencies, and reduce our environmental impact. Our capital allocation priorities emphasize investing capital to maintain production and pay existing dividends, while additional allocations toward growth projects depend on satisfaction of other financial priorities. We recognize that our business operations are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic conditions, and significant changes in climate could materially impact our operations and demand for our products. Our commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship is reflected in our action plans for climate change, which include reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity. The integration of technology into our operations is critical, as it supports our ability to manage environmental compliance and operational efficiency. We also face challenges related to cybersecurity, as our technologies, systems, and networks may be subject to breaches, which could disrupt our business operations. The effective management of our information technology capabilities is essential for supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. Our investments in technology are aimed at optimizing our asset portfolio and improving recovery from existing fields, which is vital for maintaining our competitive advantage in a volatile market.

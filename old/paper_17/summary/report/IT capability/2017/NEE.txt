nee and fpl are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems, and any failure or breach of those systems could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. nee and fpl operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. despite nee's and fpl's implementation of security measures, all of their technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to such activities. if nee's or fpl's information technology systems were to fail or be breached, sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised and nee and fpl could be unable to fulfill critical business functions. due to the size, scope, complexity and geographical reach of nee's and fpl's business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging. any disruptions or deficiencies in existing information systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new information systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues and the diversion of management's and employees' attention and resources, and could negatively impact the effectiveness of the companies' control environment, and/or the companies' ability to timely file required regulatory reports. the operational risks associated with the management of their operations, including the ability to proceed with projects under development and complete construction of facilities, may be adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and labor and regulatory compliance, inability to obtain or renew necessary licenses, rights-of-way, permits or other approvals on acceptable terms or on schedule, disputes involving contractors, labor organizations, land owners, governmental entities, environmental groups, and other factors. the ability of nee and fpl to manage their operational risks is closely tied to their information technology capabilities, which support critical functions such as transaction processing, customer service, and regulatory compliance. any failure in these systems could hinder their ability to respond to market dynamics, manage customer relationships, and maintain operational efficiency. furthermore, the integration of advanced technologies into their operations is essential for enhancing their competitive advantage and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. the reliance on information technology extends to the management of financial activities, including the use of derivative instruments to hedge against market risks, which requires robust data management and information processing capabilities. the effectiveness of these systems is vital for maintaining the integrity of financial reporting and ensuring that the companies can adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory landscapes. the interconnected nature of their operations necessitates a strategic alignment of technology resources with business objectives, emphasizing the importance of continuous investment in IT capabilities to support organizational goals and enhance overall performance. as such, the evolving nature of IT capabilities is integral to the firms' ability to navigate challenges, leverage opportunities, and drive business transformation in a competitive environment.

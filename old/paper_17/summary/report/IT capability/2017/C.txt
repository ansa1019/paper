The firm’s IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of assets and internal processes, facilitating interfirm transactions and relationships. The increase in revenues was partially offset by a 40% decrease in corporate/other, primarily due to the wind-down of legacy assets. Operating expenses were largely unchanged, as higher volume-related expenses and ongoing investments were offset by efficiency savings. The total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims increased 7% from the prior year, driven by a rise in net credit losses, particularly in North America GCB. The firm’s IT capabilities are integral in mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The firm’s IT architecture supports its operational flexibility and enhances its ability to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. The net loss was significantly impacted by a one-time, non-cash charge related to tax reform, which also affected its capital ratios. The firm’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 12.4% as of December 31, 2017. GCB revenues increased 4%, driven by growth across all regions, with North America GCB revenues increasing 3%.

The firm’s investment banking revenues increased 20%, reflecting wallet share gains across products and regions, while treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 7%.

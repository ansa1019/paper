In evaluating our business, we recognize that failure to meet the evolving needs of our markets or to identify new products, services, or technologies could adversely impact our revenue and financial results. Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and develop new or enhanced products, services, and technologies that align with these evolving needs. We continue to invest significantly in research and development, which may not yield immediate revenue, and we must develop the infrastructure necessary to scale our business appropriately. Additionally, we face risks from competition in our target markets, where competitors may offer superior functionality or better features, potentially harming our market position. System security and data protection breaches could disrupt our operations and increase expenses, adversely affecting our reputation and stock price. We rely on third-party technology for our IT infrastructure, which introduces risks related to the quality and reliability of these systems. To defend against security threats, we must continuously enhance our products' security features, which may lead to increased expenses. Our products are complex and may contain defects or vulnerabilities that could expose customers to risks, resulting in significant remediation costs and damage to our reputation. We depend on third parties for manufacturing and testing, which reduces our control over production quality and timelines. Our reliance on external software development tools can lead to delays in product introductions if those tools do not meet our design requirements. Achieving design wins is crucial for our products, and failure to do so could hinder our revenue growth and competitive positioning. Business disruptions from natural disasters or geopolitical changes could harm our operations and lead to increased costs. We must also navigate risks associated with international operations, including regulatory changes and differing legal standards. Attracting and retaining skilled employees is essential for executing our business strategy, and competition for talent can increase operational costs. Our ability to realize strategic benefits from acquisitions or investments is uncertain, and integration challenges could impact our growth. Protecting our intellectual property is vital, as litigation or regulatory proceedings can divert resources and increase expenses. Our financial results may fluctuate due to various factors, including our ability to meet customer demand and manage inventory effectively. Privacy concerns regarding our products and services could damage our reputation and lead to regulatory scrutiny. The recent tax law changes may impact our financial position and tax liabilities. Our liquidity is supported by cash and marketable securities, which we manage according to our investment policy. We anticipate that our existing resources will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements.

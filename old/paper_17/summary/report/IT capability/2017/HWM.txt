Arconic's competitive position and future performance depend, in part, on the company's ability to identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in its target end-markets, as well as to monitor disruptive technologies and understand customers' and competitors' abilities to deploy those disruptive technologies. The company is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments, including additive manufacturing, alloy development, engineered finishes, product design, and advanced manufacturing technologies. Arconic's management has intensified its focus on capital efficiency and operational performance through cost reductions, streamlined organizational structures, margin enhancement, and profitable revenue generation, which are essential for maintaining its competitive advantage. The company's ability to fund, develop, manufacture, and bring innovative new products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively is critical to its success. Arconic's business operations are capital intensive, and the company requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities. The management's review of 2017 indicates that the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength of the U.S., regional, or global economies, which may impact its operational flexibility and investment decisions. Additionally, the company faces significant competition from both U.S. and non-U.S. companies, and new product offerings or technologies in the marketplace may compete with or replace Arconic's products. Arconic's customers may experience delays in the launch of new products or changes in their business strategies, which could adversely affect the company's financial results. The company is also exposed to global cybersecurity threats that may disrupt its business operations and result in reputational harm. Arconic's focus on liquidity and cash flows, as well as improving its operating performance, is crucial for navigating market dynamics and maintaining its market-based performance. The company has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce risks associated with its global operations, but these measures may not provide adequate protection against costs or liabilities that may arise from various external influences. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, which may result in significant expenses due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Arconic's ability to adapt to evolving markets and technologies is essential for achieving and maintaining technological advantages, and the company continues to assess its strategic resource allocation to enhance its operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. The management believes that its strategic actions are beneficial to Arconic, but there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized, particularly in light of the challenges posed by competitive actions, market restructuring, and the need for effective information management and technology deployment.

We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, including the impact of global economic and political conditions on our industries, business, and financial results. Our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions, which can affect customer demand for technology purchases. The transition from personal computer to cloud, mobile, and social computing necessitates considerable investment in technology resources and infrastructure to support our business model transition to cloud-based products and more flexible product licenses. We have accelerated our move to the cloud, offering more flexible product licenses, which reflects a significant shift in our business strategy. Our ability to achieve financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties, including market acceptance of new offerings, security, reliability, and performance. The software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving customer requirements, which require us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy. We are focused on providing solutions that enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative, necessitating significant resources for the development of new technologies and business models. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which can increase the speed of delivering product functionality but also entail cost and integration challenges. Our transition to a subscription model has impacted revenue recognition, leading to a more predictable business over time, while potentially reducing upfront revenue streams. We rely on our network and data center infrastructure for operational activities, and any disruption in these systems could adversely impact our business. We are also exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively impact our financial results. Our strategy to digitize the company involves leveraging customer data through cloud and web-based technologies, increasing our exposure to security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to sensitive information. We have implemented various measures to enhance security and maintain the integrity of our systems, but the risk of security incidents remains. Our business model transition metrics, including annualized recurring revenue and total subscriptions, reflect the ongoing shift in our revenue generation strategy. We anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue, exposing us to various regulatory and economic risks. The successful execution of our restructuring efforts is critical to aligning our resources with strategic priorities, including investments in digital infrastructure and customer success. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is vital for meeting objectives related to product introductions and financial goals. We continuously evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and compliance with accounting standards, as any adverse results could impact investor confidence and our financial performance.

The proper functioning of Grainger's information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business. Grainger continues to invest in software, hardware, and network infrastructures in order to effectively manage its information systems. Although Grainger's information systems are protected with robust backup and security systems, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities, information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, and other problems. If critical information systems fail or otherwise become unavailable, Grainger's ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, and disburse funds could be adversely affected. Any such interruption of Grainger's information systems could also subject Grainger to additional costs. Breaches of information systems security could damage Grainger's reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs, and/or decrease revenues. Grainger collects and stores personally identifiable, confidential, proprietary, and other information from customers through its sales and e-commerce channels. Grainger's operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing, and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to its business, customers, suppliers, and employees. While Grainger has instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, it may be unable to protect sensitive data and/or the integrity of the company's information systems. A cybersecurity incident could be caused by malicious outsiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses. Grainger's ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of its business strategy, and any disruption could adversely impact results of operations.

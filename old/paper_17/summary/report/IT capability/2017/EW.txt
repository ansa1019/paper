Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty, including technological changes and evolving industry standards that affect our competitive position. We contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology, which are critical for maintaining operational efficiency and supporting our business needs. The timely introduction of new products is essential, as failure to innovate could lead to obsolescence and reduced market competitiveness. We invest significant financial and other resources in research and development activities to enhance our product offerings and maintain our market position. The complexity of our manufacturing processes and the reliance on external suppliers for raw materials and components introduce risks that could impact our ability to manufacture products efficiently. Our competitive advantage depends on our ability to develop and acquire new technologies and products, as well as to anticipate technology advances in the cardiovascular medical technology industry. We face challenges in maintaining strong relationships with key physicians, which are integral to the development and marketing of our products. The introduction of cost containment measures by third-party payors could adversely affect our ability to profitably sell our products, as reimbursement levels are critical to our customers' purchasing decisions. Our operations are subject to rigorous governmental regulations, and noncompliance could lead to significant sanctions that would adversely affect our financial condition. We have invested in technology infrastructure to support our operations and enhance our information management capabilities, ensuring that we can provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, and reliability. The regulatory approval process for new products requires extensive clinical trials and can be costly and time-consuming, impacting our ability to respond to market demands effectively. Our strategic resource allocation decisions are influenced by external economic conditions, which could affect our suppliers' financial viability and, consequently, our production capabilities. We continuously evaluate our investment choices in technology and innovation to ensure alignment with our long-term business strategy and to enhance our organizational capabilities. The evolving healthcare environment necessitates that we demonstrate the value of our products to healthcare providers and payors, as this is critical for maintaining our competitive positioning. Our ability to manage and leverage our IT capabilities effectively is essential for transforming our business processes and achieving operational excellence. We recognize the importance of data management and analytics in enhancing our decision-making speed and improving our organizational performance. As we expand into new markets, we must remain agile and responsive to changes in market dynamics, ensuring that our technology deployment aligns with our strategic objectives and enhances our overall business resilience.

The company’s business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology, particularly as its business processes become more digital. The company relies on technology systems for conducting business and processing claims, as well as for providing the data and analytics utilized to manage its business. Therefore, maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and enhancing technology systems that support business processes and strategic initiatives is crucial. The company acknowledges that technology initiatives present significant risks, including potential operational difficulties and additional costs if system development projects do not deliver the expected benefits or perform as intended. The company is also exposed to risks related to data security, service disruptions, or the effectiveness of its control systems, which could result in monetary and reputational damages or harm to its competitive position. The company’s operations rely on the reliable and secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. The increasing use of open source software, cloud technology, and software as a service may expose the company to greater risks related to cyber-attacks and data breaches. The company has experienced threats to its data and systems, and while it has not identified any material cyber-security breaches to date, the sophistication of such threats continues to increase. The company’s ability to effectively manage and upgrade its technology portfolio is essential for providing competitive services and conducting business with new and existing customers in a cost-effective manner. The company utilizes various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. Catastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering, and history, and the company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models, calibrating its catastrophe risk model estimates as necessary. The company’s investment strategy focuses on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration, which is critical for meeting policyholder obligations and optimizing investment returns. The company’s claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established based on management estimates, which utilize actuarial expertise and projection methods, and these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty due to various internal and external factors. The company continually refines its estimates as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees with the necessary knowledge and background is also vital for its global businesses. The competitive environment in which the company operates is influenced by technological changes, customer preferences, and the emergence of insurtech companies that utilize technology and innovation to simplify and improve the customer experience. The company recognizes that failure to keep pace with technological changes could adversely impact its competitive position and the value of its products to customers.

AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Additionally, AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including growing revenues by diversifying revenue streams, driving late-stage pipeline assets to the market and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches. AbbVie’s financial performance reflects continued added funding to support AbbVie’s emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie’s growth brands. The company has committed substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. AbbVie’s long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. The company’s pipeline currently includes more than 60 compounds or indications in clinical development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important medical specialties as immunology, oncology, and neurology along with targeted investments in cystic fibrosis and women's health. AbbVie’s products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies, and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. The company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured. AbbVie’s reliance on information technology systems is critical for operational efficiency and effective management of its business processes, including compliance with regulatory requirements and maintaining customer relationships. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of biologics is a long, expensive, and uncertain process, and the company’s ability to navigate these challenges is closely linked to its IT capabilities and infrastructure. The management of AbbVie’s information systems, including data management and information processing capacity, is essential for supporting its strategic objectives and enhancing its competitive positioning in the market.

Our ability to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools is critical. We must develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among our employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences, and internal control standards. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our operating results, client relationships, growth, and compliance programs. The effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses, and the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry include the quality of the services we render, the personalized attention we provide, and our ability to help our clients manage their overall insurance costs. If we are unable to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technology changes, our future success could be jeopardized. Our operations depend on the continued and efficient functioning of our proprietary risk management information system, which is integral to providing clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services. A disruption affecting this system could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cause reputational harm, and damage our client relationships. We rely on information technology and third-party vendors to support our business activities, and cybersecurity breaches of any of the systems we rely on may result from various cyber threats. We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, policies, and resources, and the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining, and enhancing further system protection measures could increase significantly as cybersecurity threats evolve. Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based on flat fees rather than variable commission rates. We must also develop and implement technology solutions that are aligned with our strategic goals and that enhance our operational efficiency. The integration of technology into our business processes is essential for maintaining competitiveness and achieving operational flexibility. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel who possess the necessary management skills to navigate the complexities of technology deployment and information management. As we continue to expand our international operations, we must ensure that our technology infrastructure can support our global business strategy and facilitate effective communication and coordination across geographic distances. The evolving landscape of regulatory requirements related to data privacy and cybersecurity necessitates that we maintain robust IT governance frameworks to mitigate risks and ensure compliance.

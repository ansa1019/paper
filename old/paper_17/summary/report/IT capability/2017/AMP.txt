Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including technological changes and events that could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. The profitability of our products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, which are influenced by market conditions and client activity. We believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of many of our businesses, and poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings. The market for financial advisors and portfolio managers is extremely competitive, and our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified individuals. Our businesses operate in intensely competitive industry segments, and we compete based on factors including service quality, investment performance, and perceived financial strength. The uncertain and new regulatory environment may cause various structural changes in the industry, and other competitors may be better positioned to reap the benefits of these changes. Our operational systems and networks are subject to evolving cybersecurity risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client information and damage to our reputation. We have implemented policies to protect sensitive client information and maintain corporate security, but we cannot assure that our systems will not be subject to successful attacks. Our business is reliant upon technology systems and networks to process, transmit, and store information, and maintaining the security and integrity of this information is critical to our operations. We face risks arising from acquisitions and divestitures, including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and retaining existing customers. The establishment of reserves for future policy benefits and claims is an estimation process that requires management to make assumptions about future experience, which is inherently uncertain. We utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks, and the fair value of these instruments is determined using market quotes or valuation models based on estimated future cash flows. Our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through cash generated by our operations, and we believe our cash and securities are adequate to meet anticipated obligations. The ability to meet our cash requirements depends on the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries, which are subject to regulatory capital requirements. Changes in the regulatory framework may impact our operations and financial condition, and we are subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations. The ongoing changes in regulation and oversight of the financial industry may produce results that cannot be immediately ascertained, and we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives to enhance our operational effectiveness and competitive positioning.

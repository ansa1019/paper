The company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications, and broadband communications. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change, and the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service, and delivery time. The company's long-term results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source, and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines. The company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment, believing that its global presence is an important competitive advantage that allows it to provide quality products on a timely basis to its multinational customers. The company continually develops or creates new product line concepts, and if it fails or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts, its business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. The company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition. The company's products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, and it is focused on providing comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products, and a high level of service while maintaining productivity improvement and cost control programs. The company has reported net sales growth driven primarily by growth in the information technology and data communications market, reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications. The company's strategy includes pursuing broad diversification, developing performance-enhancing interconnect solutions, expanding its global presence, controlling costs, pursuing strategic acquisitions and investments, and fostering collaborative management. The company's ability to generate cash from operations is a fundamental financial strength, and it uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. The company also relies on the capital markets to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions, and its inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect its results. Cybersecurity incidents on the company's information technology systems could disrupt business operations, resulting in adverse impacts to its reputation and operating results. Cybersecurity threats continue to expand and evolve globally, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the company. The company has implemented preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate these threats, but its infrastructure may still be susceptible to disruptions from cybersecurity incidents, security breaches, computer viruses, outages, systems failures, or other catastrophic events. The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions, and changes in these conditions may adversely impact its business and operating results.

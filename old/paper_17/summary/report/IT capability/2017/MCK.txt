The healthcare industry in the United States has changed significantly to enhance efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes, which has implications for our information technology capabilities. Our diverse range of healthcare supply management and healthcare information technology products and services means that changes in the healthcare industry could materially impact our results of operations. We rely on sophisticated computer systems to perform our business operations, and a failure or compromise of these systems may result in material adverse operational and financial consequences. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage, and hosting of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information and protected health information. We routinely process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, and any failure to comply with evolving data security laws and regulations could result in regulatory enforcement activity and fines. The constant evolution of cyberattacks necessitates increased spending to address sophisticated threats, and any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell our remote hosting services. Our investment in Change Healthcare, a joint venture aimed at providing software and analytics, network solutions, and technology-enabled services, is critical for navigating the shift to value-based healthcare. The operational integration of this joint venture requires effective management of IT capabilities to realize anticipated strategic and financial benefits. Additionally, our technology solutions segment has experienced significant competition from various service providers and healthcare manufacturers, which may lead to erosion of our market position. The healthcare technology landscape is evolving, and our ability to adapt to these changes through effective IT governance and resource mobilization is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. We are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, which can impose additional operational burdens and costs. Our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers are influenced by these regulations, which may require changes in our operations and impact our ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively. We expect to continue to invest in IT resources to enhance our operational efficiency and support our business strategies. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is vital for improving patient care delivery and driving incremental profit growth. Our strategic growth initiatives include a comprehensive review of our operations and cost structure, designed to increase efficiency and improve long-term performance. The evolving regulatory environment surrounding healthcare technology, including the FDA's focus on regulating medical software, presents both challenges and opportunities for our IT capabilities. The ability to manage and optimize our technology portfolio will be crucial for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing our overall performance.

Moody's ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses, including its electronic delivery systems, data center facilities, or the internet. The company's customers depend on its ability to receive, store, process, transmit, and otherwise rapidly handle substantial quantities of data and transactions on computer-based networks. Any significant failure, compromise, cyber-breach, or interruption of the company's infrastructure may impair its ability to deliver its products and services. The company relies on third-party providers to deliver essential services, and any failure of these providers to perform effectively could result in lower revenues and higher costs. Moody's operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information, and breaches of its or its vendors' technology and systems may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions in business operations, or compromise of confidentiality and integrity of material information. The company has invested in risk management and information security measures to protect its systems and data, but the costs and operational consequences of implementing further protection measures could increase significantly. The company is subject to evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, which impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. Moody's has implemented internal controls, policies, and procedures to deter prohibited practices, but such measures may not be effective in preventing violations of applicable laws and regulations. The company faces exposure to litigation and regulatory proceedings related to its ratings actions and other business practices, which could result in significant legal costs and damages. The company is also exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information, as its operations rely on secure processing, storage, and transmission of sensitive information. The company's ability to effectively support business needs has become a key factor in transforming it into a competitive force. The application of IT capabilities, including technology, knowledge, practices, management skills, and human resources, is essential to further organizational goals. The company must continuously adapt its IT capabilities to meet changing business needs and directions, emphasizing the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The integration of technology into business processes is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and achieving strategic objectives. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations applicable to the company's operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. The company faces challenges in managing its IT infrastructure and ensuring the reliability and security of its information systems, which are vital for maintaining customer relationships and supporting business innovation. The evolving regulatory landscape and competitive pressures necessitate ongoing investments in technology and infrastructure to enhance operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics.

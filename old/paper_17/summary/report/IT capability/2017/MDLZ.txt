We use information technology and third-party service providers to support our global business processes and activities, including supporting critical business operations; communicating with our suppliers, customers, and employees; maintaining effective accounting processes and financial and disclosure controls; engaging in mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions; conducting research and development activities; meeting regulatory, legal, and tax requirements; and executing various digital marketing and consumer promotion activities. Global shared service centers managed by third parties provide an increasing amount of services to conduct our business, including a number of accounting, internal control, human resources, and computing functions. Continuity of business applications and services has been, and may in the future be, disrupted by events such as infection by viruses or malware, other cybersecurity attacks, issues with or errors in systems' maintenance or security, migration of applications to the cloud, power outages, hardware or software failures, denial of service, telecommunication failures, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other catastrophic occurrences. Cybersecurity breaches of our or third-party systems may cause confidential information belonging to us or our employees, customers, consumers, partners, suppliers, or governmental or regulatory authorities to be misused or breached. When risks such as these materialize, the need for us to coordinate with various third-party service providers and for third-party service providers to coordinate amongst themselves might make it more challenging to resolve the related issues. Additionally, if new initiatives, such as those related to e-commerce and direct sales, increase the amount of confidential information that we process and maintain, this could increase our potential exposure to a cybersecurity breach. If our controls, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans or those of our third-party providers do not effectively respond to or resolve the issues related to any such disruptions in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we might experience delays in reporting our financial results, loss of intellectual property, and damage to our reputation or brands. We continue to devote focused resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced training, and other security measures to protect our systems and data; we are also in the process of enhancing the monitoring and detection of threats in our environment. However, security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every breach or disruption on a timely basis. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of security threats, we cannot predict the form and impact of any future incident, and the cost and operational expense of implementing, maintaining, and enhancing protective measures to guard against increasingly complex and sophisticated cyber threats could increase significantly. We regularly move data across national borders to conduct our operations and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. Our efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations. We must effectively respond to disruptions in our operations, for example, by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key or sole manufacturing or distribution locations, or cannot quickly repair damage to our information, production, or supply systems. If we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

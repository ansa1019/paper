Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable due to factors including our ability to attract and retain new end-customers and the effectiveness of our sales organization. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and the economic health of our current and prospective customers, with weak global economic conditions potentially leading to longer sales cycles and reduced unit sales. We rely significantly on revenue from our FortiGuard security subscription and FortiCare technical support services, which may fluctuate due to changes in customer satisfaction and spending levels. Our sales strategy is based on a distribution model, and we depend on our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities. The effectiveness of our sales organization is critical, as we continue to be substantially dependent on our sales personnel to obtain new end-customers and sell additional products and services. We have experienced turnover in our management-level personnel, and competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in network security. Our ability to grow revenue depends on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel. The sales prices of our products may decrease due to competitive pricing pressures, which could reduce our gross profits and operating margins. Our reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels. We have historically received a substantial portion of each quarter's sales orders during the last two weeks of the quarter, and any delays in expected orders could adversely affect our operating results. We rely heavily on information technology and accounting systems to manage critical functions such as order processing, revenue recognition, and inventory management. Our business has grown, and if we do not appropriately manage future growth, including through the expansion of our real estate holdings, our operating results could be negatively affected. We may experience difficulties maintaining and expanding our ERP and CRM systems, which are essential for processing orders, shipping products, and providing customer support. Our future performance depends on the continued services and contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and identify new opportunities. We have invested significantly in sales and marketing to drive broader market awareness and build lead generation programs, which are critical to support growth. Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, and we expect these to continue to increase as we expand our workforce. The network security market is rapidly evolving, and we must accurately predict, prepare for, and respond to technological and market developments. Our competitive position may be harmed if we do not quickly respond to the needs of our end-customers by developing and releasing new products and services. The technology in our products is complex, requiring us to effectively identify and respond to new and sophisticated methods of attack while minimizing the impact on network performance. We face intense competition in our market, and our competitors may develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours, which could adversely affect our business.

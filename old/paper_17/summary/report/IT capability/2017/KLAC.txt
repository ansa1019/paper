Ongoing changes in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, expose our business to significant risks, including the uncertainty of future growth rates and pricing trends that emphasize our customers' cost of ownership. Our ability to adapt to technological advances and develop new products timely is crucial; failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by constant technological innovation, requiring us to respond to evolving customer needs and invest significantly in research and development to enhance our product performance and capabilities. Our competitive advantage relies on accurately predicting industry standards and developing technology solutions that address changing customer requirements. The emergence of disruptive technologies and the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing processes necessitate that we maintain operational flexibility and effectively manage our technology resources. Our management monitors trends that could impact our customers' capital spending decisions, including the rising costs associated with advanced integrated circuits and the bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The concentration of our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, increases our exposure to risks related to individual customer orders, which may vary significantly and impact our revenues and operating results. We must continue to leverage our IT capabilities to support business needs, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure effective information management. Our reliance on third-party service providers for IT management and logistics introduces risks related to service quality and compliance with applicable laws. Cybersecurity threats pose additional challenges, as we collect and store sensitive data that must be protected against unauthorized access. Our information systems are critical for daily operations, and any disruptions could adversely impact our ability to process and report financial results accurately. We are committed to maintaining robust IT governance and strategic resource allocation to navigate the complexities of our operational environment effectively. The integration of new technologies and processes is essential for sustaining our competitive positioning, and we must continuously evaluate our technology portfolio to align with market demands. Our future performance is contingent upon our ability to innovate and respond to the dynamic capabilities required in the semiconductor industry, ensuring that we can meet customer expectations and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

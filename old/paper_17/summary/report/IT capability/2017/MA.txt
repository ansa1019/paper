The global payments industry is highly competitive, with substantial and intense competition affecting overall business and results of operations. Our payment programs compete against various forms of payment, including electronic, mobile, and e-commerce payment platforms, which may leverage advanced technologies to enhance their offerings. The rapid and significant technological developments, including advancements in smart cards, contactless payments, and blockchain technology, could result in new technologies that may render existing systems obsolete and impact our competitive positioning. We rely on third parties for the development of new technologies, and any inability of these companies to keep pace with technological advancements could negatively affect our offerings. Our ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards, as well as by resistance from customers or merchants to changes. 

The acquisition of Vocalink has expanded our capability to process automated clearing house transactions, enhancing our technology portfolio and operational flexibility. However, operating a new real-time account-based payments network presents regulatory and operational risks associated with integrating this acquisition into our business. The complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities distinct from those faced on our core network. 

We are also subject to regulations that affect our participation in the payments industry, which may impose additional compliance burdens and increase costs. The regulatory landscape is evolving, with increased scrutiny from regulators that could impact our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services. Moreover, our relationships with financial institutions and other stakeholders are critical, as their success and competitiveness directly influence our business performance. 

Our operational efficiency is contingent upon the effective management of our technology infrastructure, which supports our global payments network. The secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information are paramount, as any information security incidents could disrupt our business and damage our reputation. We maintain an information security program to mitigate risks associated with cyber threats, which have significantly increased due to the proliferation of new technologies and the sophistication of organized crime. 

In addition, our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by market dynamics and competitive actions. The need for operational flexibility and the ability to respond to market changes are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. As we continue to develop integrated products and services, our information management capability will play a crucial role in providing data and information to users with the necessary levels of accuracy, timeliness, and security. 

Overall, our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of assets and internal processes, are vital in supporting our business strategies and enhancing our market-based performance. The ongoing evolution of our technology resources and capabilities will be critical in navigating the challenges posed by regulatory changes and competitive pressures in the global payments landscape.

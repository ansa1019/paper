The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand, which may lead to variability in our customers' business plans and consequently affect demand for our equipment and services. This variability is influenced by several factors, including electronics demand, economic conditions, and our customers' ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex semiconductor devices. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training and managing our workforce. Our management must continuously reassess strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment to ensure we have the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations. We rely on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success, which necessitates significant investments in research and development focused on leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing requirements. Our core technical competency involves integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control, which enables results on the wafer. The effective operation of our business depends on critical information systems, which include telecommunications, the internet, various computer hardware and software applications, and network communications. These systems are susceptible to cybersecurity threats and other incidents that could disrupt operations and impact our results. We have implemented security procedures to mitigate risks associated with these information systems, but they cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to our success, as is our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems and services. The outcomes of strategic alliances and customer consolidation may negatively affect our business, as these alliances can lead to standardization of processes that may not include our products. Additionally, we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers for manufacturing operations and administrative functions, including information technology. Disruptions in these services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products, and generate revenues. Our investments in research and development are essential for maintaining competitive advantage, and we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully to avoid adverse effects on sales. Our future success depends on our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to enhance existing products in a timely manner. The semiconductor industry is subject to rapid technological changes, and our failure to develop the correct technology solutions could adversely affect our business. We must also navigate various regulatory environments and compliance requirements, which impose costs on our business and may present risks if we are unable to comply. Our financial performance is closely tied to our ability to manage these challenges effectively, ensuring that we can continue to invest in technology and maintain operational efficiency.

Occidental's strategy focuses on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition through continual enhancements to its asset quality, organizational capability, and innovative technical applications that provide competitive advantages. The company aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of consistent dividend growth and value growth through oil and gas development that meets above cost-of-capital returns. Occidental's operations benefit from scale, technical expertise, environmental and safety leadership, and commercial and governmental collaboration, which allow it to bring additional production quickly to market and provide low-cost growth opportunities with advanced technology. The oil and gas segment implements this strategy by focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies, improvement in new well productivity, and better base management to reduce total spend per barrel. Occidental's technical capabilities enable it to achieve low development and operating costs to obtain full-cycle value while promoting innovative ideas that differentiate its approach and provide future opportunities. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support business needs. Occidental relies on digital systems, related infrastructure, technologies, and networks to run its business and to control and manage its operations. The company has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of cyber-attacks, which have escalated in recent years. Occidental's businesses are subject to various external influences, including governmental regulations and taxes, which may restrict or prohibit activities, increase costs, or reduce demand for its products. The company faces competition for reserves, which may make it more difficult to find attractive investment opportunities or require delays in reserve replacement efforts. Occidental's ability to add reserves depends on the success of improved recovery, extension, and discovery projects, which are partially or fully outside management's control. The company continues to seek opportunities to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices. Occidental's capital expenditures reflect its strategy to focus on achieving returns well above the cost of capital even in a low price environment. The company also aims to enhance its operational flexibility and market agility through strategic resource allocation and investment decisions. The integration of technology capabilities is crucial for Occidental to maintain its competitive positioning and operational efficiency. The firmâ€™s IT capabilities are essential in managing its information processing capacity and ensuring information reliability, security, and confidentiality. The company's commitment to digital transformation is evident in its focus on enhancing its technology infrastructure and capabilities to support business innovation and performance improvement. As Occidental navigates the complexities of the oil and gas industry, it remains focused on leveraging its technology resources and capabilities to drive organizational effectiveness and performance outcomes.

The growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries, and our electronic design automation (EDA) and intellectual property (IP) product sales are particularly reliant on these sectors. Our customers frequently incorporate third-party IP into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process, necessitating close collaboration with major foundries to ensure compatibility of our EDA, IP, and manufacturing solutions. If we fail to optimize our solutions for these processes, our offerings may become less desirable, adversely affecting our business and financial condition. The semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems, with many customers outsourcing manufacturing and relying on various IP providers, which heightens the need for effective IT capabilities that support business needs and enhance operational efficiency. Our ability to innovate and introduce new products or effectively integrate acquired technologies is critical to maintaining our competitive position in a rapidly evolving market characterized by dynamic competition and technological advancements. We compete on the basis of technology, product quality, and features, and our success hinges on our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts. Additionally, we invest substantially in research and development to enhance our product offerings and meet customer demands for innovative technology while managing costs. Cybersecurity threats pose significant risks to our information technology infrastructure, potentially compromising sensitive information and harming our reputation. We store sensitive data in our data centers and networks, making us vulnerable to attacks that could disrupt operations and lead to non-compliance with applicable laws. Our commitment to protecting proprietary technology is paramount, as our success relies on safeguarding our intellectual property and managing the complexities of compliance with evolving regulations. We also face challenges in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, which is essential for driving our future success and managing our technology resources effectively. Our business model, which includes a significant reliance on time-based revenue, requires us to maintain strong customer relationships and adapt to changing market dynamics. The integration of acquired technologies and the management of our technology portfolio are crucial for sustaining our competitive advantage and ensuring alignment with our strategic objectives. The complexity of our customer arrangements necessitates a robust information management capability to support decision-making processes and enhance overall organizational performance. We believe that our ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively will be a key driver of our business transformation and long-term growth.

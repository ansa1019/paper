Our business relies heavily on our information technology systems for key business processes, including inventory management, customer communication, transaction processing, and results summarization. We extensively utilize our hub network, supply chain, and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations. Significant investments in our supply chain are aimed at improving our ability to provide the best parts at the right price and to meet consumer product needs. We have initiated strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which increased our inventory per location. Our ability to manage readily-available inventory demand and competitive delivery options is critical, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive marketplace. The increasing use of technology poses risks as customers can quickly compare products and prices, and utilize social media for feedback, which can impact our reputation and sales. We believe that we compete effectively on the basis of merchandise availability due to investments in inventory and the development of a robust distribution network providing efficient access to products required on-demand. Our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service to complement the products we offer, which necessitates a higher cost structure than some competitors. We utilize promotions, advertising, and loyalty programs to drive customer traffic and compete effectively. The reliance on third-party service providers for our IT systems introduces risks, as these systems are subject to damage or interruption from various factors, including cyber-attacks and system compromises. If our systems fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, resulting in lost sales and potential loss of customer loyalty. We accept payments using various methods, which may have information security risk implications. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection, and privacy is becoming increasingly rigorous, and compliance with these requirements could result in significant additional costs. We believe that our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, are essential for transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is critical to our operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. We have made significant investments in technology to enhance our operational capabilities and to support our business strategies. Our IT governance framework is designed to ensure that our technology resources are aligned with our business needs and strategic objectives. The challenges we face in managing our IT resources and capabilities can impact our overall performance and competitive positioning in the market.

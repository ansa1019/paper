The company must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade its information technology systems, including protecting against internal and external cybersecurity threats. Information technology enables efficient operations, customer interface, financial accuracy, and the accurate production of financial statements. If the company does not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, it could face transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or loss or damage to intellectual property through security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include various forms of electronic security breaches that could disrupt business systems, hinder customer order processing, and lead to unauthorized release of confidential information. The company believes it has adopted appropriate measures, including ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments, to mitigate potential risks to its technology and operations from these disruptions. However, the unpredictability of such disruptions could lead to operational interruptions, damage to brand image, and private data exposure. Furthermore, if its data management systems, including its SAP enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data for business operations, the company's ability to plan, forecast, and execute its business plan, as well as comply with applicable laws and regulations, could be materially impaired. The company recognizes that its IT capabilities have been evolving to encompass the coordination of its assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is critical for transforming the firm into a competitive force, as it represents the application of IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills to achieve organizational goals. The company’s focus on information management capability emphasizes the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored to changing business needs. The effectiveness of its IT systems is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and supporting business innovation, as well as for managing relationships with customers and distributors. The company’s reliance on bottlers and distributors for product manufacturing and distribution highlights the importance of maintaining good relationships with these partners to ensure effective marketing, promotion, and sales of its products. The strategic relationship with TCCC, including the transition of distribution rights, underscores the significance of IT capability in managing complex commercial arrangements and ensuring the successful execution of business strategies. The company acknowledges that failure to recognize expected benefits from new distribution arrangements could adversely affect operating results and shareholder value. Thus, the integration of IT capabilities into its operational framework is vital for enhancing competitive advantage, supporting strategic resource allocation, and achieving performance improvements across its business processes.

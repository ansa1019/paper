Moody's operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S., including the Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. These regulations are complex and continually evolving, which may increase the uncertainty regarding potential changes in laws and regulations and their enforcement. The company derives a significant amount of its sales from banks and other financial services providers who are subject to regulatory oversight, which requires them to exercise comprehensive oversight throughout each phase of their business arrangements with third-party service providers. Moody's faces risks related to financial reforms outside the U.S. affecting the credit rating industry, its businesses, and its customers. The company is also exposed to risks from infrastructure malfunctions or failures, which may impact its ability to conduct business. The company's operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and other types of information, which underscores the importance of its IT capabilities. Cybersecurity incidents could cause reputational harm, loss of customers, and financial losses. The company has implemented measures to detect and prevent unauthorized activity, but these precautions may not be successful. As the company has grown and acquired businesses, it has developed guidelines for IT standards, which can create unintended vulnerabilities. The company relies on third-party providers for essential services, and any disruption in these services could adversely affect its operations. Moody's ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including data protection and privacy laws, is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance systems, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The company's ability to develop and successfully launch innovative products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements is a key factor in maintaining market share. The introduction or development of competing technologies and products by other companies can negatively impact the nature and economics of Moody's business. The company faces increased pricing pressure from competitors and customers, and the emergence of generative AI and other technologies may further intensify these pressures. Moody's growth prospects and operating margins could be adversely affected by its failure to make necessary capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements. The company is also exposed to risks related to protecting its intellectual property rights, which could harm its reputation and affect its ability to compete effectively. The company's operations are exposed to risks from complex U.S., foreign, and other local laws and regulations that apply to its operations abroad, which may increase the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. The company continues to monitor developments related to financial reforms affecting the credit rating industry and its customers, but it cannot predict the extent of future laws and regulations and their effects on its business. The company's ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled professionals, including financial analysts and software engineers, is critical to its success. Rising expenses, including wage inflation and global labor shortages, could adversely affect the company's ability to attract and retain high-quality employees.

Duke Energy's operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support underlying business processes. The company believes that the digital transformation of its business is key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers. Duke Energy's information technology systems are critical to cost-effective, reliable daily operations and the ability to effectively serve customers. The company expects customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions, necessitating enhancements or replacements of its information technology systems in response. This involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand. Failure to successfully implement critical technology, or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, could materially adversely affect the business strategy as well as impact the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of the Duke Energy registrants. The company relies on information technology systems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support various business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personally identifiable information of customers and employees. Duke Energy's information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, which are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from various events, and failures. Cybersecurity risks have increased due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks. The company faces heightened risks of cyberattacks designed to gain unauthorized access to information and disrupt utility operations. In the event of a significant cybersecurity breach, business operations could be disrupted, leading to theft of confidential information, substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, and increased regulation and reputational damage. Duke Energy maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, but such insurance may be insufficient to offset losses. The company is subject to standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation regarding the protection of critical infrastructure assets. The operational effectiveness of Duke Energy is also influenced by the need for ongoing investments in technology infrastructure to ensure reliability and efficiency in service delivery. The company continues to enhance its customers' experience through data-driven approaches that inform operational priorities and performance levels. The reliance on information technology systems and the need for continuous improvement in these systems underscore the importance of strategic resource allocation and management capability in achieving business objectives and maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market landscape. The integration of digital technologies into operational processes is viewed as essential for optimizing investments and delivering growth and customer value, while also addressing the challenges posed by regulatory changes and market dynamics.

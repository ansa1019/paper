The global payments industry is highly competitive, with substantial and intense competition affecting overall business and results of operations. Our payment programs compete against various competitors within and outside the industry, including general purpose payments networks, digital wallets, and fintechs. These competitors may leverage technology to support their services, providing cost advantages and potentially influencing payment choices within the ecosystem. Our ability to compete effectively may be impacted by regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation and competition-related regulatory proceedings. We are also subject to increasingly complex, fragmented, and divergent laws and regulations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, which could lead to substantial compliance-related costs and affect our operational efficiency. The rapid and significant technological developments in the payments industry necessitate our continuous adaptation to new technologies, including advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Our reliance on third parties for technology development and access poses risks, as their inability to keep pace with technological changes could negatively impact our offerings. We must also navigate the complexities of integrating new technologies and ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory requirements, which may increase operational costs and impact our ability to leverage data for innovation. Furthermore, the expansion of our products and services as part of our multi-rail strategy has created the need for new types of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and compliance burdens distinct from those imposed on our core payment network activities. Our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, are designed to support and strengthen our payment solutions, reflecting our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities. The importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources, in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities, underscores our strategic focus on IT capability as a key driver of competitive advantage. The operational flexibility and management capability required to adapt to changing market dynamics are critical for maintaining our position in the industry. Our organizational capabilities, including data management and information systems capability, play a vital role in supporting our business processes and enhancing our performance metrics. As we continue to innovate and transform our business, the integration of technology into our operations will be essential for achieving our strategic objectives and ensuring long-term organizational effectiveness. The challenges posed by regulatory scrutiny, competitive actions, and the need for operational resilience necessitate a robust IT governance framework that can effectively manage risks and support our strategic resource allocation decisions.

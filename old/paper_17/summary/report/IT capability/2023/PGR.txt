Our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our systems, facilities, and business functions, as well as the operation of various third-party systems. The shut-down, disruption, degradation, or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. Many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, and an interruption or degradation of service from a third-party system could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions, including customer interactions and access to company or customer data. We must develop and maintain large and complex technology systems, and we rely on third-party systems and applications to run our operations and to store significant volumes of data. Our information security efforts are designed to evolve with the changing security threat environment through ongoing assessment and measurement. We face risks associated with cybersecurity threats, including unauthorized access to our systems and data, which could lead to significant operational difficulties and reputational harm. Our ability to innovate effectively and respond to competitors' initiatives is critical to maintaining our competitive position, as technological and societal changes may lead to changes in customer preferences. Our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves, which are influenced by the availability of reliable data and our ability to conduct complete and accurate analyses. The complexity of our products and systems is increasing due to ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, and informational developments, which may create barriers to innovation or the provision of high-quality products and customer experiences. We must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high-quality products and customer experiences, and our reliance on third-party systems, including cloud computing environments, increases the risk of loss or unauthorized access to information. Our ability to attract, develop, and retain talent with strong technological and analytical skills is critical to our success, as is our ability to adjust claims accurately and deploy claims resources effectively. We are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations that may limit our ability to operate and innovate, and compliance with these laws often results in increased costs. The performance of our investment portfolios is subject to various risks, including market conditions and the performance of third parties with whom we enter into significant contracts. Our financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary, and our access to capital markets is dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. Our long-term business strategy may not be successful, and new products and services may entail new risks and require significant expenditures. The development and use of new technology, including artificial intelligence, present additional risks that may adversely affect our business. We must continually adapt and enhance our processes and technological defenses to address evolving cybersecurity risks, and our ability to respond to regulatory actions regarding technology use will be critical to our operations.

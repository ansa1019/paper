Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the impact of failures, disruptions, instability, or vulnerabilities in our information technology systems, networks, or applications. We depend heavily on the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology systems and networks to create and deliver our products and service our clients. Any failures or delays in our information technology architecture or platforms may disrupt our operations and impose additional costs in deploying our products or services. We rely on third-party suppliers of data, applications, and services, and any failure to supply, errors, or reduction in the accuracy or quality of such data could impair our ability to provide our clients with our products and services. Our operations rely on the secure collection, retrieval, storage, transmission, and other processing of confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and other types of data and information. Cybersecurity risks may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties, or may result from human error, software bugs, server malfunctions, or other technological failures. Our operations are also exposed to security risks, including cyber-attacks and other security incidents, which could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data or information in our possession. We have implemented safeguards and policies to protect sensitive client data, but there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient. Additionally, the increasing reliance on digital technologies and the integration of artificial intelligence into our operations may introduce new risks and challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ability to effectively use the internet, including our remote workforce's ability to access the internet, may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures or malicious attacks exploiting security vulnerabilities. The introduction of new technologies and processes, such as cloud computing and agile software development, may result in unanticipated failures or delays in the performance and delivery of our products and services. We must continually enhance our technology capabilities to remain competitive and meet evolving client needs, which includes investing in research and development to create new or enhanced products and services. Our growth strategy includes enhancing distribution and content-enabling technology, strengthening client relationships, and executing strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary data, content, and technology companies. We also face challenges related to the management of our technology infrastructure and the need to ensure operational efficiency across our global operations. The effectiveness of our IT governance and the management of our technology resources are critical to our ability to respond to market dynamics and maintain our competitive advantage. Our financial performance is influenced by our ability to leverage our IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance operational flexibility. The realization of any risks associated with our IT capabilities could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

The company faces risks related to its operational, technological, and organizational infrastructure, which are critical for developing, operating, and adapting technology in a rapidly changing environment. Digital technology, cloud-based services, data, and software development are deeply embedded into the business model. The ability to manage and safeguard information systems and infrastructure is essential for providing products and services and communicating with customers. The company is heavily reliant on the security, capability, integrity, and continuous availability of technology systems to manage internal financial and other systems, monitor risk, and comply with regulatory requirements. A cyber-attack or other security incident could result in increased costs, reductions in revenue, reputational damage, legal exposure, and business disruptions. The company must accurately process, record, and monitor a growing number of complex transactions, and the increasing use of near real-time money movement solutions adds complexity to preventing, detecting, and recovering from fraudulent transactions. The reliance on third-party service providers for information technology and communications systems introduces additional risks, including the potential for service disruptions or failures that could materially harm business operations. The company has migrated core information technology systems to third-party cloud infrastructure platforms, which necessitates effective management and oversight to avoid service disruptions. The operational risk management program establishes practices for assessing the operational risk profile and executing key control processes for operational risks, including cyber and technology risk. The company is also exposed to risks from the extensive use of models, artificial intelligence, and data, which are critical for assessing and managing various risk exposures, creating estimates and forecasts, and managing compliance with regulatory capital requirements. The reliance on quantitative models and the use of AI necessitate careful management of data aggregation and validation procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform into a competitive force. The IT capability is essential for supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency, and the company continues to invest in digital technology to attract new customers and facilitate existing customers' financial transactions. The ability to innovate and adapt to market dynamics is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage, and the company must effectively manage its technology deployment and infrastructure capability to respond to evolving business needs and external influences. The strategic resource allocation and management of technology capabilities are fundamental to achieving organizational goals and enhancing firm performance.

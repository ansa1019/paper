The company employs information including operational technology systems to support its business and to collect, store, and/or use proprietary and confidential information, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of its business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security and data breaches, cyberattacks, and other cybersecurity incidents involving the company's information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure could disrupt or interfere with the company's operations; result in the compromise and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to the company or its customers, suppliers, and employees; and expose the company to numerous expenses, liabilities, and other negative consequences, any or all of which could adversely impact the company's business, reputation, and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, the company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted, or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of its businesses that is subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. The company's increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the COVID-19 health pandemic, also introduces additional threats and risks of disruptions to its information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure. Despite the company's cybersecurity countermeasures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities or a cyberattack to remain undetected for an extended time period, and the prioritization of decisions with respect to security measures and remediation of known vulnerabilities may prove inadequate to protect against these attacks. The company continues to make investments in the implementation of new business systems and solutions, including enterprise resource planning, with these investments impacting cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development. The company's financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans, and it utilizes various tools, such as continuous improvement, to improve productivity and reduce expenses and engages in ongoing global business transformation, including restructurings from time to time, to streamline its operations, improve operational efficiency, productivity, and the speed and efficiency with which it serves customers. The ability to adapt to business model and other changes, including responding to evolving customer needs and service expectations, are important, and, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the company's ability to win new business and enhance revenue. The company recognizes that operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change, and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The company has also experienced, and expects to continue to experience, cyberattacks that may lead to disruptions of the company's and the third parties' information and operational technology systems and infrastructure. Any cybersecurity incident or information or operational technology network disruption could result in numerous negative consequences, including the risk of legal claims or proceedings, investigations or enforcement actions by U.S., state, or foreign regulators; liabilities or penalties under applicable laws and regulations, including privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions; interference with the company's operations; the incurrence of remediation costs; loss of intellectual property protection; the loss of customer, supplier, or employee relationships; and damage to the company's reputation, any of which could adversely affect the company's business.

Nike faces difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining its increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. Information technology systems are critical to many of Nike's operating activities and business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. The company has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions where it operates, and its work to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems and related processes is ongoing. Nike continues to invest in these efforts, but it cannot assure that the measures taken will be sufficient to protect its information technology systems and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures, or data loss. The failure of these systems to operate effectively could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations, requiring significant capital investments to remediate problems, which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities. The company relies on information technology systems for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement, and the marketing and use of its digital products and services. Any interruption in these systems may impede Nike's ability to engage in the digital space and could result in lost revenues and damage to its reputation. The company has experienced cyber-attacks, including phishing attempts, and while these have not had a material impact on operations to date, there is no assurance that future attacks will not affect the company. Nike's digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks, and standards that it does not control. The company has made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for its Nike Direct operations, which require continued investment in the development and upgrading of technology platforms. The success of these operations could be adversely impacted if consumers find that the digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations. Additionally, the company is subject to risks related to the financial health of its wholesale customers, which could impact its ability to collect on receivables and its financial condition. The transition to a distributor model in certain regions is expected to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility and selling and administrative expenses over time, but it may also reduce revenue growth in the short term. Nike's commitment to product innovation, quality, and sustainability relies on its ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media and digital environment, including reliance on social media and digital advertising networks. The company is focused on creating a unified technology foundation to accelerate its digital transformation and enhance operational efficiency.

We rely extensively on information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. Our IT/OT systems, networks and services are utilized for ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, summarizing and reporting results of operations, managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms, hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information, collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, providing data security, and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. A significant information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes and/or associated sites owned or operated by the company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers' IT/OT databases or systems. If the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. We must successfully manage the demand, supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of any future disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation, evolving digital marketing and selling platforms and changing consumer habits. We must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors, customers and vendors. Our financial results have been, and in the future could be, adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. We must be able to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change, including attracting and retaining key talent as part of our overall succession planning. Our success depends on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. We believe this strategy is right for the long-term health of the company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top third of our peer group.

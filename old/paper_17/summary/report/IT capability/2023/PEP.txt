The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has resulted in increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, which can adversely affect our business. Our ability to innovate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase, and consume them, is critical. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, inventory write-offs, or erosion of our competitive and financial position. We depend on information systems and technology for many activities important to our business, including communications, inventory management, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Our business has been negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, and security incidents, which may arise from cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. The increase in certain employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks, our business can be adversely affected, resulting in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and lost revenues. We regularly evaluate our portfolio of businesses and assess potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, which require effective integration of information technology systems. Our reliance on third-party service providers for information technology support services can also expose us to risks if these providers fail to meet their obligations. We are focused on reducing virgin plastic through new launches of bottles made with recycled plastic while also expanding our digital capabilities to support customers on their sustainability journey. Our technology management strategies include leveraging digital technologies to enhance operational efficiency and support business transformation initiatives. The ongoing evolution of our IT capabilities emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. We have experienced significant disruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain, which are subject to geopolitical events and natural disasters. Our strategic management practices involve continuous monitoring of market dynamics and external influences to ensure effective resource allocation and operational flexibility. The implementation of our multi-year productivity plan aims to simplify, harmonize, and automate processes, including re-engineering our information systems. Our ability to attract, develop, and maintain a highly skilled workforce, particularly in areas such as e-commerce and digital marketing, is essential for sustaining our competitive advantage in a rapidly changing business environment. We continue to invest in technology deployment and digital infrastructure to enhance our organizational capabilities and improve firm performance.

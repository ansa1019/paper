As a global investment management firm, BlackRock recognizes that technology and operational risks could adversely affect operations, damage the company's reputation, and cause declines in assets under management (AUM), revenue, and earnings. The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution, and investment operations provided via its technology platform, Aladdin, are important elements of BlackRock's competitive success. The company’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. BlackRock's ability to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business is critical, and any failure in this regard could materially impact operations. The company also relies on third-party service providers for cloud hosting and technologies supporting cloud-based operations, which introduces additional risks, including operational and execution risks. BlackRock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of AUM, and the company believes it is well positioned for a stabilizing rate environment due to the breadth, diversification, and investment performance of its fixed income platform. The planned acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) is expected to enhance BlackRock's capabilities in the infrastructure sector, which is increasingly important as clients seek diversified, long-duration investments. BlackRock's strategy includes leveraging technology services offerings to enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk effectively. The integration of Aladdin and eFront allows clients to better manage and analyze risk across their entire portfolio, spanning public and private markets. BlackRock continues to evolve its technology capabilities, including investments in Aladdin AI copilots and enhancing connectivity with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions. The company is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions for both retail investors and institutions, which includes a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index, and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. BlackRock’s long-term strategy remains to drive growth in technology, including the Aladdin platform, which is designed to facilitate investing and enhance operational efficiency. The company believes that the organizational architecture changes, including embedding the ETF and index business across the entire firm, will accelerate the growth of ETFs and other investment strategies. Additionally, BlackRock is committed to providing clients with choice and executing in accordance with their chosen objectives, which includes investing in sustainable strategies. The company's ability to react to changes in the asset management industry and respond to evolving client demands is critical for maintaining its competitive advantage. The development and introduction of new products and services require continued innovative efforts and may involve significant time and resources, underscoring the importance of technology management and operational flexibility in achieving business objectives.

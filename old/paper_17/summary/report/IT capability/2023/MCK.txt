Our business relies on sophisticated information systems and networks to perform operations, including obtaining, processing, analyzing, and managing data that facilitate the purchase and distribution of inventory items. We provide remote services that involve hosting customer data and operating software on our own or third-party systems. Our prescription technology solutions segment combines automation and our ability to navigate the healthcare ecosystem to connect patients, pharmacies, providers, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, and biopharma to address medication access, affordability, and adherence challenges. This segment also offers prescription price transparency, benefit insight, and dispensing support services across various therapeutic categories and temperature ranges to biopharma customers throughout the product lifecycle. We experience significant problems with information systems or networks, which are vulnerable to interruptions or damage from various sources, including power loss, telecommunications failures, and cybersecurity incidents. If these information systems or networks suffer errors, interruptions, or become unavailable, we might experience disruptions in business operations, loss of customers or revenue, and increased expenses. Our technology products and services involve complex software that may contain errors, especially when first introduced to the market, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny and damage our reputation. We are subject to various privacy and data protection laws that complicate our operations and add to our costs. Our ability to grow our businesses depends on acquiring, developing, and implementing new technologies and capabilities, as well as forming and expanding business relationships. We face competition from companies that adopt emerging technologies more rapidly, which may impact our ability to maintain a competitive advantage. Our technology services have seen increased contributions driven by higher volumes, and we have recorded gains related to antitrust legal settlements. The implementation of new technologies, including AI, introduces new risks, such as data inaccuracy and unreliability. We must adequately develop, implement, and monitor outsourced service providers to realize expected cost savings and benefits. Our strategic growth objectives include investing to build an integrated oncology service business and expanding our biopharma services business, which requires hiring and retaining talented individuals with necessary knowledge and skills. Our operational flexibility and ability to respond to market dynamics are critical for achieving our business goals. We rely on technology to enhance our operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, which is essential for meeting customer demands and navigating regulatory complexities. The evolving landscape of healthcare reform, including changes in pricing and reimbursement models, creates uncertainties that may affect our business performance. Our organizational capabilities in managing information technology resources and processes are vital for supporting business needs and enhancing our competitive positioning in the market.

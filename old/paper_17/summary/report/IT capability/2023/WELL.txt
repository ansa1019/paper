Our reliance on data and technology systems and the increasing risks of cybersecurity incidents highlight the importance of IT capability in our operations. We depend on our operator to manage and operate the property, including complying with laws and providing resident care, while we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property, including those relating to data privacy and security laws. The impacts of severe cold and flu seasons or other widespread illnesses on occupancy can adversely affect our operators' and tenants' revenues, which are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and government reimbursement. We regularly monitor and review our rights and remedies under our management agreements, considering numerous legal, contractual, regulatory, business, and other relevant factors, which underscores the significance of management capability in navigating these complexities. Our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations, which could result in increased costs and operational risks. The ability to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us is critical, as is our ability to integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations efficiently. We face competition for acquisition opportunities from other well-capitalized investors, which may adversely affect our ability to acquire desired properties or increase purchase prices. Our operators and managers compete on a local and regional basis, which may limit their ability to attract residents and employees or expand their businesses. The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers, and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our dependence on key personnel and the ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel are crucial for the effective operation of our seniors housing operating properties. The performance of our operators and tenants is subject to various operational risks, including fluctuations in occupancy, economic conditions, and compliance with federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification, and inspection laws. Our ability to manage these risks effectively is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring operational efficiency. We utilize various key performance indicators to evaluate our business and make resource allocations, which include monitoring the performance of our properties and the creditworthiness of our obligors. Our asset management process includes the review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, which is vital for supporting the collectability of revenue and the value of our investments. The strategic management of our investments, including the evaluation of market conditions and operational performance, is critical for achieving our financial objectives and maximizing stockholder value. Our ability to leverage technology resources and capabilities effectively will play a significant role in transforming our operations and enhancing our market responsiveness.

Our business depends on the effective management of our information technology systems, which are critical for managing sales and marketing data, accounting and financial functions, inventory management, product development tasks, clinical data, customer service, and technical support functions. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively support our operations, and any damage or interruption to these systems could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results. The operation of our business is vulnerable to cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption, which could impede our operations or result in decreased sales, liability claims, regulatory penalties, or loss of proprietary information. Our information technology infrastructure and products are susceptible to various risks, including computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware attacks, and other forms of malware. Additionally, we depend on technology suppliers, including cloud-based data management applications hosted by third-party service providers, whose security systems are subject to similar risks. Significant disruptions in either our or our service providers' information technology could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.

We face substantial competition and must continuously innovate and develop new products to maintain our market position. Our success is measured by our ability to demonstrate the value of our differentiated products to healthcare providers and payors, which is increasingly important in a value-based healthcare environment. The medical technology industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve, requiring us to invest significantly in research and development to transform care and meet changing market demands. We invested 17.8% of our net sales in research and development in 2023, focusing on developing innovative technologies that improve patient outcomes.

Our continued growth and success depend on our ability to recruit and retain qualified talent and execute management succession plans. The competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and our ability to attract and retain skilled professionals is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and achieving our organizational goals. Additionally, we actively manage a portfolio of research and development products and explore potential acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, which requires effective resource allocation and strategic decision-making.

We are subject to various regulatory requirements that govern our operations, including compliance with information security and privacy laws. Our ability to protect our intellectual property and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive company information is vital to our competitive positioning. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant penalties and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our operations are impacted by external factors such as public health crises, economic conditions, and changes in government regulations, which can create challenges in maintaining operational flexibility and market responsiveness.

Overall, our IT capabilities are integral to our business strategy and operational effectiveness, enabling us to respond to market dynamics and support our innovation initiatives while managing risks associated with information technology and regulatory compliance.

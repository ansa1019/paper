The utility's electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks, including the operation and decommissioning of the utility's nuclear generation facilities. The utility's ability to efficiently construct, maintain, operate, protect, and decommission its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably is subject to numerous risks, including those arising from breakdowns or failures of equipment and systems. The utility's operational networks and information technology systems could be impacted by a cyber incident, cybersecurity breach, or physical attack, which could disrupt operations and harm the utility's ability to safely generate, transport, deliver, and store energy and gas. The utility relies on complex information technology systems to process sensitive information, including financial information and customer data, and is increasingly required to disclose large amounts of data to support changes to California's electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice. The utility's reliance on third-party vendors for system maintenance and updates poses additional risks, as these vendors may not implement adequate security measures or timely updates. The utility faces various cybersecurity threats, including unauthorized access attempts and denial-of-service attacks, which could result in significant expenses, regulatory actions, and reputational harm. The electric power and natural gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which require modernization of the electric distribution grid to accommodate increasing two-way flows of electricity and integrate distributed energy resources. The utility's ability to adapt to these changes is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and meeting customer demand. The utility's strategic management practices include improving the planning and execution of its work through increased efficiencies, such as waste elimination through the lean operating system. The utility's capital investment plan aims to achieve operating cost savings while meeting safety and climate goals, which is essential for maintaining its competitive advantage. The utility's financial condition and operational performance are closely linked to its ability to manage costs effectively and recover expenditures through regulatory mechanisms. The utility's participation in the wildfire fund and its wildfire mitigation initiatives are critical for managing risks associated with catastrophic wildfires, which have significant implications for its financial performance. The utility's recorded liabilities for wildfire-related claims reflect the ongoing challenges in managing operational risks and regulatory compliance. The utility's ability to recover costs associated with wildfire mitigation and other operational expenditures is contingent upon regulatory approvals, which are subject to uncertainties that could materially affect its financial condition and operational capabilities. The utility's strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by the evolving regulatory landscape and market dynamics, necessitating a focus on innovation and technology deployment to enhance its operational efficiency and effectiveness.

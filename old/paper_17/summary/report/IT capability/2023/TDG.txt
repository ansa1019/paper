The company has access to classified, sensitive, confidential, or personal data that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, or other contractually imposed controls.

The company’s operations depend on its manufacturing facilities, which are subject to risks that could disrupt production, including cyber attacks and computer malfunctions. The company’s ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control, including the effectiveness of its information technology systems in supporting operational efficiency and business performance. The company has implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with data protection laws, but there can be no assurance that these controls will enable full compliance. The company’s ability to make payments on and refinance its indebtedness, as well as to fund operations, will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to various external influences.

The company’s investments in technology resources are aimed at enhancing its competitive advantage and ensuring that it can meet evolving business needs. The ongoing evaluation of technology capabilities and infrastructure is crucial for maintaining market responsiveness and achieving strategic alignment with business objectives.

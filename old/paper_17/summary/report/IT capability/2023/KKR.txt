Investing in our securities involves risk, and we operate an investment management business where we manage investment vehicles that invest in alternative asset classes and conduct a related capital markets business. Our investment management and insurance businesses are materially affected by market and economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, and changes in laws. The performance and value of the investments held by us and our investment vehicles, as well as our ability to find suitable investments or secure financing, are influenced by these conditions. We believe that competition for investors in our investment vehicles is based primarily on investment performance, investor liquidity, and the quality of services provided. The insurance market is highly fragmented, and we compete with other financial institutions that offer investment products, where technological advancements and innovation are occurring rapidly. We rely significantly on third-party service providers for operational support, and any failure in their systems could materially and adversely affect our businesses. Cybersecurity threats pose risks to our information technology infrastructure, and we face ongoing security threats that could disrupt our operations. Our investment vehicles and businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which creates potential liabilities and penalties that could adversely affect our financial condition. We depend on the efforts, skills, and reputations of our employees, and our ability to retain and recruit talent is critical to our success. The loss of key personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors and result in reduced assets under management. Our insurance business, through global atlantic, is subject to material risks and uncertainties that differ from those of our asset management business. Global atlantic's ability to grow is dependent on its capital base, and it must manage its investments effectively to maintain profitability. Changes in market conditions, including interest rates, could adversely impact global atlantic's financial performance. Additionally, global atlantic's investment strategies must adapt to evolving regulatory environments, which could impose additional compliance costs. The success of our investment strategies relies on our ability to identify and capitalize on market opportunities while managing risks associated with market volatility and economic conditions. We face challenges in maintaining operational flexibility and achieving competitive advantages in a rapidly changing business landscape. Our organizational structure and governance practices must align with regulatory requirements, and we must navigate potential conflicts of interest arising from our diverse investment activities. The evolving preferences of investors and increased scrutiny on environmental, social, and governance matters may also impact our ability to attract capital and execute our investment strategies effectively.
Through its ability to elect our board of directors and its approval rights over certain corporate transactions, the series I preferred stockholder may be deemed to control our business and affairs, including influence over the amount and timing of our investments and dispositions, indebtedness, and cash expenditures. The vote of our series I preferred stock will determine the outcome of all matters that are not listed below as being subject to a vote by our common stock. Furthermore, holders of our common stock have the right to vote on the adoption of a new equity compensation plan, any material amendment to an existing equity compensation plan, and an issuance of common stock if, based on the number of shares or the voting power outstanding before such issuance, more than 1% of our common stock is issued to our affiliates and other related parties or more than 20% of our common stock is issued in any transaction, subject to certain limited exemptions. In addition, any person that beneficially acquires 20% or more of any class of stock then outstanding without the consent of our board of directors is unable to vote such stock on any matter submitted to such stockholders. The entry into a debt financing arrangement by us in an amount in excess of 10% of our then existing long-term indebtedness will require the approval of the series I preferred stockholder. The issuance by us or our subsidiaries of any securities that would represent, after such issuance, at least 5% on a fully diluted basis of any class of our or their equity securities will also require such approval. The adoption by us of a shareholder rights plan, the amendment of our certificate of incorporation, and certain provisions of our bylaws relating to our board of directors and officers will also require the approval of the series I preferred stockholder. The merger, sale, or other combination of our company or KKR Group Partnership with or into any other person will similarly require such approval. The termination of our employment of any of our officers or the officers of any of our subsidiaries without cause will also require the approval of the series I preferred stockholder. Our board may be prevented from causing us to take any of the actions discussed above if the series I preferred stockholder does not provide its approval to any such action, even if the board believes such action may be in the best interest of us and our stockholders. The provision of our certificate of incorporation requiring exclusive venue in the state and federal courts located in the state of Delaware or federal district courts of the United States for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain additional provisions affecting the holders of our common stock, including limitations on the calling of meetings of the stockholders and procedures for submitting proposals for business to be considered at meetings of the stockholders. The market and economic conditions are expected to continue to have a substantial impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and our business in various ways that we are unable to control, including our ability to make new investments, the valuations of the investments we manage, and the level of our capital markets activities. Our asset management and insurance businesses are affected by various market and economic conditions of the various countries and regions in which we operate. The need to comply with the 40% test may cause us to restrict our business and subsidiaries with respect to the assets in which we can invest and/or the types of securities we may issue.

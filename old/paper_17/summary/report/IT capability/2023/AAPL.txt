The company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. The company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by various events. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company's business by preventing access to the company's online services, interfering with customer transactions, or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company's products. The company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the company's business, and harm to the company's reputation. The company's business, results of operations, and financial condition depend substantially on the company's ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. The company must make significant investments in research and development to ensure the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The company relies on third-party software developers, and decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. The company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software and services for the company's products compared to competitors' platforms. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems regularly, which can impair the company's ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the company's stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the company to litigation or government investigations. The company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data. The company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the company's customers and employees. The company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. However, these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the company's business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. The company's reliance on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia, and Europe to supply and manufacture many components presents risks that could negatively impact the company's cost or supply of components or finished goods. The company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and competitive advantage.

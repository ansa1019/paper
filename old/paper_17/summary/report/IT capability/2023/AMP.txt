Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including market fluctuations and technological changes, which may materially affect our business performance. The competitive industry environment, characterized by intense competition and the economies of scale for larger competitors, could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase market share and profitability. Our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries, including broker-dealers, banks, asset managers, and insurers, some of which have greater investments in technology and analytics. The ability to attract and retain talent, particularly financial advisors, is critical to our growth and results, as our performance is dependent on the strategies and decisions of our portfolio managers and analysts. Our investment performance is a key competitive factor for our asset management products and services, and strong investment performance supports the retention of our products and creates opportunities for new sales. Furthermore, our reliance on technology systems and networks to process, transmit, and store information, including personal information of clients, employees, and advisors, is essential to our business operations. Maintaining the security and integrity of these systems is critical, as any cybersecurity incidents could result in reputational damage and additional costs. We face risks related to operational failures, including interruptions in telecommunications or data processing systems, which could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to clients. The evolving regulatory landscape, particularly concerning cybersecurity and data protection, requires us to establish and maintain corporate policies and technical measures designed to protect sensitive information. Our operational systems and networks are subject to technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information or loss of proprietary information. We rely on third-party service providers and vendors for certain communications and technology functions, and their operational failures could adversely impact our ability to effect transactions and manage risk exposure. The management of operational, legal, and regulatory risks requires effective policies and procedures to record and verify transactions and events. We also recognize the importance of developing new products and services that respond to changes in the industry and evolving client demands, which requires significant resources and ongoing support. The introduction of artificial intelligence presents both opportunities for operational efficiency and new risks that must be managed through our strategic and risk management policies. The financial performance of our business is influenced by our ability to effectively manage and market new or existing products and services, which must align with client needs and market dynamics. Our ability to achieve strategic objectives is impacted by various external factors, including market conditions, regulatory actions, and technological advancements. The integration of technology into our operations is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and achieving competitive advantages in the marketplace.

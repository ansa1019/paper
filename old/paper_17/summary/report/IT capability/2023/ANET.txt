Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology, network connectivity, and access to data and applications. Adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The networking market is rapidly evolving, and failure to successfully carry out new products and service offerings could adversely impact our business. We face intense competition and industry consolidation, which may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The growth and evolution of the networking market, including the evolution of the market for AI networks, will be dependent upon various factors, including the adoption of and demand for our customers' products and services, changes in technological requirements, and the amount and mix of capital spending by our customers. Our ability to provide networking solutions that address the needs of our customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies is crucial. 

We believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy network architectures, and our cloud networking platforms are well positioned to address the growing cloud networking market. Our research and development efforts are focused on new product development and maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in software development to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform and introduce new products and features.

We have made substantial investments to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and internal research and development efforts. If we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may lose our competitive position, and our products may become obsolete. Our products must interoperate with operating systems, software applications, and hardware developed by others, and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware, we may lose or fail to increase market share.

The management of our supply chain has been adversely affected by geopolitical conditions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has resulted in prolonged manufacturing and supply chain disruptions. Insufficient component supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers to build our products exposes us to operational risks, including their ability to obtain sufficient components for our products and to ramp manufacturing sufficiently to meet our customer demand. 

We are also subject to risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations. Our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend significantly on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide. We are subject to various export controls, and failure to comply with applicable export control laws could have negative consequences, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties. The regulatory environment applicable to the handling of personal data continues to evolve, and compliance with emerging and changing legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

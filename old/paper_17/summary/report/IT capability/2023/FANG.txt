The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including the potential for a cyber incident that could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss. We rely extensively on information technology systems, including internally developed software, data hosting platforms, real-time data acquisition systems, and third-party software, to process and analyze all stages of our business operations, including exploration, drilling, completions, production, transportation, and other related activities. Our operations depend heavily on electrical power, internet and telecommunication infrastructure, and information and computer systems. If any of these systems were to fail or become unavailable or compromised, our ability to safely and effectively operate our business would be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have implemented and invested in controls, procedures, and protections designed to protect our systems and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threats. However, these measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats, and the controls we have implemented may prove to be ineffective. We maintain specialized insurance for possible liability resulting from a cyberattack on our assets, but we cannot assure that this coverage will be adequate. Our reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of personal devices and remote communications. The oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements, and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to keep pace with these developments. Our ability to respond to competitive pressures and implement new technologies is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and achieving strategic objectives. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including operating costs and potential environmental liabilities, which are influenced by our technological capabilities. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed, which is dependent on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The enactment of climate change-related regulations may impose new costs on our operations and create reputational risks associated with the exploration for and production of hydrocarbons. Our targets related to sustainability and emissions reduction initiatives may expose us to numerous risks, including the potential for increased compliance costs and operational risks. The successful integration of technology and operational processes is essential for achieving our goals in environmental responsibility and operational efficiency. We continuously evaluate our technology portfolio and the effectiveness of our information systems to ensure alignment with our business strategies and market dynamics. The ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively is critical for transforming our business and enhancing our competitive advantage in the oil and natural gas industry.

We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including security breaches, privacy breaches, cyberattacks, and failures to comply with information security laws or regulations, which could harm our business by disrupting service delivery and damaging our reputation. Cybersecurity is fundamental to our complex, global business, as we electronically receive, process, store, and transmit sensitive and confidential information of our clients and their customers. Our information systems depend upon hardware, software, and other technological components that require timely patches, updates, or remediation of vulnerabilities. The uninterrupted operation of these systems is critical, and security breaches represent principal operational risks we face. Our ability to manage risks from diverse security attacks is essential as we serve a varied client base with different technology needs. We are bound by many limitations on the disclosure of information received from clients, and failure to comply with regulations could expose us to damages from legal actions and governmental proceedings. The adoption of more restrictive privacy laws or data protection rules could adversely impact our business through increased costs or inefficiencies. Our operations are also subject to evolving regulations regarding cybersecurity and privacy, which require compliance across many aspects of our activities, including safeguarding, training, and documentation. The failure to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties and damage to our brand. We continue to invest in modernization, innovation, and integrated solutions to meet market demands and compete effectively. Our internal development activities focus on the modernization of proprietary core systems, the design of next-generation digital solutions, and the development of processing systems and risk management platforms. As consumer preference shifts towards digital banking solutions, we provide integrated platforms that support a consistent omnichannel experience for banking services. Consolidation within the banking industry may present both risks and opportunities for our business, as newly formed entities may choose to migrate to a single platform, potentially expanding our solutions' usage. Our future success will depend on our ability to innovate and adapt our solutions to changes in technology and market demands. The payment processing industry is undergoing significant changes, and we believe that our scalable, integrated business model positions us well to leverage emerging payment technologies. We are also exposed to risks related to the execution of services provided by our brokerage operations, including trading errors and system failures. Our ability to attract and retain talent, particularly in technology, is critical to our growth and operational efficiency. The competitive nature of the market for skilled personnel could impact our ability to satisfy client demand in a timely fashion. We face challenges related to managing compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which rely on skilled professionals. Our ongoing future forward initiative aims to achieve significant cost savings and streamline operations, while we continue to assist financial institutions in migrating to outsourced integrated technology solutions. The need to keep pace with rapid technology changes is acute as we shift towards software as a service and cloud-based solutions. Our business relies heavily on technology infrastructure that must be continuously updated and maintained to ensure operational efficiency and security.

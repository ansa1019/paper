Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price, and our operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to numerous factors, including changes in the global economic environment and the ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels. We face price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models. The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings, where revenue is recognized over time, reflects our strategic shift towards enhancing our IT capabilities. Our ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model could result in significant restructuring charges, affecting our operational flexibility and resource allocation. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and growth of our markets, and impairment of that trust could adversely affect demand for our products from customers outside of the United States. We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns that complicate revenue prediction. Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and we have faced component shortages that have affected our operations. We have increased our efforts in procuring components to meet customer expectations, contributing to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. The process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible, and virtual networks, is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends, our business could be harmed. We are transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling integrated products and services, which requires significant investments in IT capabilities. Our strategy is to securely connect everything, and we are committed to driving a trusted customer experience through our innovation and solutions. We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results, and these acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and technologies of acquired companies. Our ability to manage distribution of our products and services is crucial, as disruption in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change and converging technologies, which represent a competitive threat to us. Our strategic alliances with large organizations may provide complementary products and services, but they also carry risks, as we must compete in some areas with companies with which we have alliances. Our investments in engineering, sales, service, and marketing activities are intended to enhance our IT capabilities and drive profitable growth over the long term. We are exposed to fluctuations in market values and interest rates, and our ability to retain and recruit key personnel is essential to meet our objectives. Our business is subject to risks from geopolitical tensions, economic instability, and regulatory changes, which could materially affect our operating results and financial condition.

We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to collect, analyze, process, store, manage, transmit, and protect business operations, processes, transactions, and data. Our systems, and the third-party systems with which we interact, are subject to damage, failure, or interruption due to various reasons, including power or other critical infrastructure outages; facility damage; physical theft; telecommunications failures; malware; security incidents; cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, spyware, denial of service attacks, and ransomware; natural disasters and catastrophic events; inadequate or ineffective redundancy measures; and design or usage errors by team members, contractors, or third-party service providers. A material incident could significantly disrupt our operations and business processes; result in the impairment or loss of critical data; be costly and resource-intensive to remedy; and/or harm our reputation and relationship with customers, team members, suppliers, and other stakeholders, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Our information technology systems, infrastructure, and personnel require substantial investments, such as replacing systems, maintaining or enhancing systems, or designing or acquiring new systems. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, incurring more costs than expected, or implementation delays or errors, and may result in operational challenges, security control failures, reputational harm, and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We have taken significant and appropriate steps to protect this information, including maintaining compliance with payment card industry and national clearing house standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies, employee training, and monitoring and routine testing of our systems. However, these security measures are costly and require constant, ongoing attention and may not prevent a security breach due to cyber-attacks, computer malware viruses, exploitation of hardware or software vulnerabilities, team member error, malfeasance, system compromises, fraud, hacking, trickery, or other intentional or unintentional acts, which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. There is no guarantee that the security measures that we and our third-party service providers and suppliers have implemented, or will introduce in the future, to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, or provide us with sufficient visibility to determine if data security breaches have occurred. A compromise of our security measures or those of a third-party we entrust could result in information related to our customers, suppliers, team members, or the company being obtained or misused by unauthorized persons; damage to our reputation; adverse operational effects or interruptions; costs to the company to address the breach, which could require extensive time and financial resources to resolve; or claims, litigation, or possible regulatory action against us, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The regulatory environment related to information security and data collection, processing, use, and privacy is complex and constantly evolving. The effects of complying with stricter and more complex data collection, processing, use, and privacy and information security laws, regulations, and standards can be far-reaching and may increase our responsibility and liability, which may increase our costs by needing to invest significant, additional time and resources and make changes to our existing practice and processes. Failure to comply with data collection, processing, use, and privacy and information security laws, regulations, and standards by us or our third-party service providers or suppliers could subject us to fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, lawsuits, or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

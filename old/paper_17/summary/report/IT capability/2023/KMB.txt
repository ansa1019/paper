Failure of key technology systems, cyberattacks, privacy breaches or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. To conduct our business, we rely extensively on information and operational technology systems, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal communications and communicating with customers, consumers, vendors, investors and other parties; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; receiving and processing purchase orders and shipping products to customers; processing transactions; storing, processing and transmitting data, including personal confidential information and payment card industry data; supporting employee data processing for our global workforce; hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business and financial information; and complying with financial reporting, regulatory, legal and tax requirements. Furthermore, we sell certain products directly to consumers online and through websites, mobile apps and connected devices, and we also engage in online activities, including data collection, promotions, rebates and customer loyalty and other programs, through which we may receive personal information. A breach or other breakdown in our technology, including a cyberattack, privacy incident, data incident or other event involving us or any of our third-party service providers or vendors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Despite the security measures we have in place, the information and operational technology systems, including those of our customers, vendors, suppliers and other third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have, in the past, and may, in the future, be vulnerable to cyber-threats such as computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, cyber extortion, security incidents, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, phishing attacks, social engineering and other disruptions from employee error, unauthorized uses, system failures, including internet outages, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors or cyberattacks by hackers, criminal groups, nation-states and nation-state-sponsored organizations and social-activist organizations. We have seen and may continue to see an increase in the number of such attacks, especially as we continue operating under a hybrid working model under which employees can work and access our technology infrastructure remotely. In addition, while we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, costs related to a cyberattack may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or be excluded under the terms of our cybersecurity insurance policy. Our security efforts and the efforts of our third-party providers may not prevent or timely detect future attacks and resulting breaches or breakdowns of our, or third-party service providers', databases or systems. In addition, if we or our third-party providers are unable to effectively resolve such breaches or breakdowns on a timely basis, we may experience interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business, as well as reputational harm, governmental fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings, and litigation and remediation expenses. We are in the process of upgrading our enterprise resource planning system (known as SAP) to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations. We also use various other hardware, software and operating systems that may need to be upgraded or replaced in the near future as such systems cease to be supported by third-party service providers, and may be vulnerable to increased risks, including the risk of security breaches, system failures and disruptions. System upgrades take time, require oversight and may be costly, and pose several challenges, including training of personnel, communication of new rules and procedures, migration of data, increased risk of security breaches, and the potential instability of the new system. Moreover, there is no assurance that the new enterprise resource planning system will meet our current and future business needs or that it will operate as designed. Any significant failure or delay in system upgrades could cause an interruption to our business and adversely affect our operations and financial results.

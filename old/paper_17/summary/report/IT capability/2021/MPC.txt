We are increasingly dependent on our information technology systems and those of our third-party business partners and service providers for the safe and effective operation of our business. We rely on such systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, including financial records and personally identifiable information such as employee, customer and investor data, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including our supply chain, pipeline operations, gathering and processing operations, credit card payments and authorizations at certain of our customers' retail outlets, financial transactions, banking and numerous other processes and transactions. Our systems (and those of our third-party business partners and service providers) are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and attacks, including ransomware and other malware, and phishing and social engineering schemes, which can compromise our ability to operate, and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data in our systems or those of our third-party business partners and service providers. Cybersecurity events involving our information technology systems or those of our third-party business partners and service providers can result in theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential financial data, regulated personally identifiable information, intellectual property and other information; give rise to remediation or other expenses; result in litigation, claims and increased regulatory review or scrutiny; reduce our customers' willingness to do business with us; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; and subject us to litigation and legal liability under international, U.S. federal and state laws. We have developed a rin integrity program to vet the rins that we purchase, and we incur costs to audit rin generators. We have established a 2030 target to reduce our absolute scope 3 - category 11 ghg emissions by 15% below 2019 levels. Additionally, mplx established a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity by 75% below 2016 levels. The reduction target applies to mplx's natural gas gathering and processing operations and represents an expansion of the existing 2025 target, established in 2020, to reduce methane emissions intensity by 50% below 2016 levels. Our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social and governance dimensions of our business. We are committed to positioning our assets so that we are a leader in operational, financial, and sustainability performance and are evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio. Our goal is that each individual asset generates free-cash-flow back to the business and contributes to shareholder returns. With our investments, we are focused on high returning projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness of our portfolio, including our investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves. We are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection, new approaches in the commercial space to be more dynamic amidst changing market conditions, and achieving technology improvements to advance our commercial performance. Our commitment to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs, improving efficiency, driving operational improvements and being disciplined in capital allocation means lowering our costs in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be disciplined in every dollar we spend across our organization. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant, including upgrades to information technology systems.

The oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital and industrial control technologies to conduct exploration, development, and production activities. Occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems, related infrastructure, technologies, and networks to run its business and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, marketing, and pipeline operations. The use of the internet, cloud services, mobile communication systems, and other public networks exposes Occidental to cyber attacks, which could disrupt operations by causing delays, impeding processing of transactions, and leading to the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information. Cyber attacks on information or industrial control systems could negatively impact operations, including unauthorized access to seismic data or production-related infrastructure, resulting in loss of production or accidental discharge. Occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate these risks, although there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent breaches. The company’s ability to execute new business strategies effectively is crucial, particularly in the context of transitioning to sustainable energy and government regulation regarding the environment and climate change. Occidental’s strategies include achieving net-zero emissions in its operations and energy use before 2040, which require substantial new capital and the development or implementation of new technologies. The successful execution of these strategies may depend on the availability, timing, and cost of equipment, manufactured goods, and services, as well as the availability of requisite financing and federal and state incentive programs. The operational flexibility regarding the mix of short-cycle and mid-cycle projects, along with knowledge and experience in CO2 separation, transportation, use, recycling, and storage, positions Occidental to support its transition to net zero and create opportunities in a low-carbon future. The company’s operational priorities include enhancing capital and operational efficiency to sustain production levels and free cash flow while advancing technologies and business solutions to drive a sustainable low-carbon future. Occidental’s investments in carbon management and low-carbon technologies are expected to reduce its carbon footprint and enable others to do the same. The integration of technology and operational efficiencies is critical for maximizing shareholder returns and achieving strategic goals, including specific emissions reduction targets and advancing carbon removal projects. The ability to leverage technology capabilities and manage information effectively is essential for maintaining a competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. The company continues to develop new technology and strategies to meet its emissions goals, which exposes it to various operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. As Occidental navigates the complexities of the energy transition, its focus on digital transformation and IT capabilities will play a pivotal role in shaping its future performance and organizational effectiveness.

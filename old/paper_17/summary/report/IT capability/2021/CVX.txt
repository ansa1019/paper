Chevron's operations are subject to numerous risks, including those associated with cybersecurity and the protection of its information technology (IT) systems and data. The company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business, which could compromise its process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure. Cyber threat actors are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company's IT systems, which could result in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment, or loss, misuse, or corruption of critical data and proprietary information. The company's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency, incorporating potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, among other factors. However, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency, or severity of such events, any of which could materially affect the company's results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, the company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources, and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that may arise from significant incidents or unforeseen liabilities. The effects of changing commodity prices are a core part of Chevron's business planning process, as fluctuations in global crude oil prices can materially impact the company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The company is in an extractive business and must successfully develop resources to avoid a decline in its operations. The ability to navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its workforce and operations is also critical, as is the ability to manage relationships with suppliers and partners. Furthermore, Chevron's operations are influenced by changing political, regulatory, and economic environments, which can affect its competitiveness and operational capabilities. The company is also exposed to legal, regulatory, and ESG-related risks, which could result in increased costs and reduced demand for its products. The evolving expectations on various ESG matters may require changes in how Chevron operates and could lead to negative stakeholder sentiment. The company has set aspirations and targets related to emissions and sustainability, which are subject to numerous risks, including the availability of commercially viable technologies and evolving regulatory requirements. The ultimate impact of these factors on Chevron's financial performance is highly uncertain, as they depend on a multitude of variables, including market conditions and the company's ability to adapt to changing business needs and directions.

AEP's performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, which involves risks including information technology failure that impairs AEP's information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations. Information technology failure that affects AEP's ability to access customer information or causes loss of confidential or proprietary data could materially and adversely affect AEP's reputation or expose AEP to legal claims. AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, with operations dependent on information technology systems. The computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks, making them potential targets for cyber-attacks. A successful cyber-attack on the systems that control generation, transmission, and distribution could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues. AEP's operations are subject to mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cybersecurity standards, and compliance with these standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. AEP's ability to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates is not assured, and if AEP is found not to be in compliance with these standards, it could face sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. The reliance on electric transmission facilities that AEP does not own or control exposes AEP to risks; if transmission is disrupted or capacity is inadequate, AEP may not be able to deliver wholesale electric power. AEP's business plan for the construction of new projects involves risks, including construction delays and the potential for significant cancellation penalties under equipment purchase orders and construction contracts. Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises, challenging AEP's competitive ability to maintain efficient operations. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has created uncertainty that could negatively affect AEP's ability to operate its generating and transmission and distribution assets, impacting financial performance. AEP's financial performance may also be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform corporate functions, with operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes being significant risks. AEP's management believes that its experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives it an advantage over competitors in securing authorization for new transmission lines and facilities. However, there can be no assurance that regulatory bodies will authorize new projects or that existing projects will not face challenges. AEP's business strategies are influenced by regulatory actions, market dynamics, and technological advancements, which may require extensive system and operational changes, increase operating costs, or adversely impact the attractiveness of the services AEP offers. The company is also subject to risks associated with climate change, which may require investments in additional generating assets and infrastructure to serve increased load due to changing weather conditions. AEP's financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies it serves, and management cannot predict the outcome of legal proceedings related to its business activities, which could require significant expenditures that may reduce future net income and cash flows.

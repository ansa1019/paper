The utility's operational networks and information technology systems could be impacted by a cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event, or physical attack. The utility's electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events and malicious events. The utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store, and otherwise process sensitive information, including financial information, customer energy usage, and personal information. The utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and to provide other services. Any incidents or disruptions in the utility's information technology systems could impact its ability to track or collect revenues and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. The utility's operational networks may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. The occurrence of any cyber incidents could significantly disrupt operations and negatively impact the utility's ability to safely generate, transport, deliver, and store energy or otherwise operate efficiently. The utility's information technology systems have been subject to breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access, which could result in significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers, and harm to the utility's reputation. The utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents; however, there is no assurance that adequate insurance will continue to be available at reasonable rates or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance. The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, requiring modernization of the electric distribution grid to accommodate two-way flows of electricity and interconnect distributed energy resources. The utility's ability to efficiently construct, maintain, operate, protect, and decommission its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably is subject to numerous risks, including those arising from the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines. The utility must effectively adapt to these changes, or its business model and ability to execute its strategy could be materially impacted. The utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, including the utility's ability to recover costs through regulated rates. The utility's operational flexibility and capacity to respond to market dynamics are critical in navigating the evolving landscape of regulatory requirements and technological advancements. The utility's participation in the wildfire fund is subject to conditions that could materially affect its financial condition and operational capabilities. The utility's reliance on technology resources and management capability is essential for enhancing its operational efficiency and achieving strategic objectives in a competitive environment.

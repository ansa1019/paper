The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and liquidity, affecting our ability to effectively deploy technology resources and manage operational efficiency. We have taken actions to monitor and mitigate changes in our supply chain and port destination availability, which may strain relationships with our vendors and port partners. The pandemic has led to significant disruptions, creating new risks and exacerbating existing risks to our business, including challenges in executing our return to service plans due to new and evolving operating protocols. Our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to repay or repurchase debt at maturity, which could negatively affect our business. We have reduced our planned capital spending through 2022, which may negatively impact or delay our execution of planned growth strategies, particularly as it relates to investments in our ships, technology, and our expansion of land-based developments. The reliance on technology to assist with mitigating risks associated with COVID-19 has led to the deployment of patented technologies aimed at minimizing congregate settings onboard and quickly identifying close contacts of cases. However, the inability to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our competitive position. Our business requires sophisticated technology and systems that necessitate significant investment and must be proven, refined, updated, and replaced with more advanced systems to continue meeting customer demands and expectations. The complexity of our operations, including the reliance on third-party vendors for integral services, exposes us to risks that could adversely impact our business. The significant capital investments and expenditures required to remedy issues related to technology deployment and operational disruptions could strain our financial condition. Furthermore, we are exposed to cybersecurity attacks and data breaches, which pose risks to our information systems and data integrity. The frequency and sophistication of these attacks have increased over time, and a successful cyber attack could interrupt our operations and adversely impact our brand reputation. Our reliance on supply chain vendors and third-party service providers, which are also affected by COVID-19, could limit our ability to deliver our cruise experience. We continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships and may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships, which would be financed through additional indebtedness or equity securities. Our ability to effectively manage our technology infrastructure and respond to competitive pressures is critical for our operational flexibility and overall business performance. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our operations and cash flows has led to significant impairments and credit losses, which may continue to affect our financial condition. We have taken significant actions to improve our liquidity, including reducing operating expenses and capital expenditures, while also focusing on enhancing our technology capabilities to support our recovery and long-term profitable growth.

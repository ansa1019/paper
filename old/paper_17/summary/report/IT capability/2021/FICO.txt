The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, leading to disruptions in supply chains, business operations, and consumer confidence. Our business strategy increasingly focuses on investing significant development resources to enable substantially all of our software to run on the FICOÂ® platform, designed to support advanced analytics and decisioning use cases. This strategy aims to increase our business by selling multiple connectable and extensible products to clients and developing custom client solutions. We may experience volatility in our revenues and operating results caused by various factors, including the adoption of new sales and delivery methods and the timing of investments necessary to develop and operate our cloud-based offerings. Our revenues depend significantly on conditions in the banking industry, and if our clients' industry experiences uncertainty, it will likely harm our business and financial condition. The market acceptance of our products may be affected by changes in technology, our inability to obtain or use key data for our products, and the failure to successfully adopt cloud-based technologies. Our growth and success depend on our ability to develop and sell new products or suites of products, including cloud-based offerings, and if we fail to do so, our business could suffer serious harm. We have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products due to difficulties in acquiring data and adapting to client systems. Our ability to provide reliable service depends on the efficient operation of our data centers and IT systems, which could be exposed to damage or interruption from various events, including cybersecurity threats. We routinely face cybersecurity threats, and if our cybersecurity measures are compromised, our reputation may be damaged, and we could incur significant liabilities. Our business strategy and future success depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in research and development, to support our technology and product development initiatives. The complexity of our products requires highly trained personnel, and we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel, particularly in technical roles. Additionally, our business requires access to a reliable source of current and relevant data to analyze transactions and update our products. If we fail to maintain sufficient data sourcing relationships, our products may become less effective. Our operations are subject to various legal and regulatory risks that may expose us to liability and affect our ability to compete in certain markets. Changes in privacy and data security laws could negatively impact the demand for our products and services. We continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses and may make changes that could disrupt our operations or affect our revenues. Our acquisition activities may also disrupt our ongoing business and involve increased expenses, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals contemplated at the time of a transaction. We rely on relationships with third parties for marketing and distribution, and difficulties in these relationships could adversely affect our future revenues. Our management approach includes ongoing reengineering efforts designed to grow revenues through strategic resource allocation and improve profitability through cost reductions, which may not be successful if we fail to increase revenues or if productivity declines.

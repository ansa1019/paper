The Allstate Corporation operates in highly competitive markets that are impacted by new and changing technologies. The company must continually allocate resources to refine and improve products and services to remain competitive. Technological advancements and innovation are occurring in distribution, underwriting, claims, and operations at a rapid pace. If Allstate is unable to adapt to or bring advancements and innovations to market, the quality of its products, relationships with customers and agents, competitive position, and business prospects may be materially affected. The transformative growth strategy aims to accelerate growth by expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing the level and sophistication of new customer acquisition, and deploying new technology applications. The strategy encompasses all aspects of Allstate's customer experience and business model, spanning product distribution and sales, operations and servicing, and claims processing. The company relies heavily on computer systems, mathematical algorithms, and data to perform necessary business functions, and it has experienced breaches of data and systems, although none have had a material effect on its business to date. The increased use of third-party services can complicate the identification and response to cyberattacks. Allstate's management emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform the firm into a competitive force. The company’s IT capabilities are essential for supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. The board of directors has overall responsibility for oversight of management's design and implementation of the enterprise risk and return management framework, which manages risk on an integrated basis. The risk and return committee oversees the effectiveness of the program, governance structure, and risk-related decision-making, while focusing on the company's overall risk profile. The company also faces risks related to cybersecurity and privacy events, which could materially affect its financial condition and operations. The reliance on technology for data management and customer interactions is critical, and changes in technology related to the collection and application of data could expose Allstate to regulatory or legal actions. The ability to adequately price products and services is affected by the evolving nature of consumer needs and preferences, market and regulatory dynamics, and the broader use of telematics-based rate segmentation. Allstate's investment portfolios are subject to market risk, and adverse changes in economic conditions could significantly affect its ability to meet liquidity needs or obtain credit on acceptable terms. The company’s strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by its operational flexibility and the need to respond to market dynamics. The integration of technology into business processes is vital for maintaining competitive advantage and enhancing firm capabilities. The company’s governance contexts and strategic management practices are designed to optimize resource deployment and ensure alignment with organizational goals.

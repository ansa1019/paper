In evaluating our business, we recognize that our IT capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. Our IT capability is critical in transforming our firm into a competitive force, representing our ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes. We emphasize our information management capability, which includes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, while tailoring these in response to changing business needs and directions. The integration of technology into our operations is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and enhancing our organizational capabilities. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems, which require ongoing commitment of resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with changes in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risks. The volume of healthcare data generated and the uses of this data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding, and our ability to develop, implement, price, and support new and existing products and services depends on the integrity of this data. We face challenges related to cybersecurity, as our systems and those of our third-party service providers are regularly targeted by cyber-attacks, which could disrupt our operations and expose us to liability under various laws. We have security technologies, processes, and procedures in place to protect against these risks, but the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats necessitates continuous enhancement of our controls and practices. Our IT infrastructure is integral to our operational flexibility and ability to respond to market dynamics, including changes in healthcare practices, demographic shifts, and regulatory requirements. The management of our information systems and data integrity is crucial for accurately predicting and managing healthcare costs, which directly impacts our profitability. We are also dependent on third-party vendors for significant portions of our business infrastructure and operating requirements, and any disruptions in these services could adversely affect our operational effectiveness. Our strategic management practices involve leveraging IT capabilities to optimize our business processes and enhance customer relationships, which are vital for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly changing market environment. The ongoing development and enhancement of our IT capabilities are priorities for us, as they are essential for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and improving our overall business performance.

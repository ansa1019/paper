nee and fpl are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems, and any failure or breach of those systems could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure is required in their highly regulated industry. if nee's or fpl's information technology systems were to fail or be breached, sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised, and they could be unable to fulfill critical business functions. the development and maintenance of information technology systems to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging due to the size, scope, complexity, and geographical reach of their business. operational failure or capacity constraints of third parties, including those who provide power transmission and natural gas transportation services, also pose risks to their operations. the companies add, modify, and replace information systems regularly, and modifying existing information systems or implementing new or replacement systems involves risks, including integrating the modified, new, or replacement system with existing systems and processes. any disruptions or deficiencies in existing information systems, or disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new information systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, and the diversion of management's and employees' attention and resources. the operational risks associated with their electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are compounded by the reliance on information technology systems to process and monitor a vast number of transactions daily. the companies face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals, and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede their development and operating activities. they are also exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices, which can affect their financial performance. nee and fpl utilize derivative instruments to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as to optimize the value of their power generation and gas infrastructure assets. the companies' risk management tools and metrics associated with their hedging and trading procedures are based on historical price movements, and any significant deviations from historical behavior could lead to material adverse effects. the companies' ability to recover costs associated with severe weather events is subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by regulators not to permit timely and full recovery of costs incurred could have a material adverse effect on their business. the reliance on information technology systems extends to their retail businesses, which require access to sensitive customer data, and any significant breach could materially adversely affect their reputation and customer confidence. the management of counterparty credit risk is essential for their energy marketing and trading operations, and established policies are in place to monitor current and forward credit exposure to counterparties. changes in the regulatory environment, including new or revised laws or regulations, could also impact their operational flexibility and market responsiveness.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to technological changes and events. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic and societal disruption, affecting our business and operating environment. We continue to actively monitor the potential direct and indirect impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our segments, including changes in client behavior and the availability and cost of capital. The financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic and other factors, including technological changes. We face intense competition in our industries, with larger competitors having greater investments in technology and resources. Our ability to maintain or increase market share and profitability may be negatively impacted by this competition. The success of our strategies may be affected by the dynamics of the business, political, and regulatory environments, which are subject to substantial change. We are dependent on our network of advisors to drive growth and results in our wealth management business, and the investment performance of our asset management products is influenced by the strategies and decisions of our portfolio managers and analysts. Our financial performance also requires us to develop, effectively manage, and market new or existing products and services that appropriately respond to changes in the industry and evolving client demands. The introduction of new products and services requires significant time, resources, and ongoing support, and substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with this process. Our operational systems and networks are subject to evolving cybersecurity risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information and damage to our reputation. Maintaining the security and integrity of our information systems is critical to our business operations. We rely on third-party service providers for certain technology functions, and any failure or operational issues with these providers could adversely impact our ability to effect transactions and service our clients. Our risk management policies may not fully mitigate our risk exposure in all market environments, and we continue to assess our exposure to different industries and counterparties. The performance and financial strength of financial institutions are interconnected, and a decline in the condition of one or more institutions may expose us to credit losses or defaults. The ability to maintain our unaffiliated third-party distribution channels is crucial for our growth strategy, and any reduction in access to these distributors may materially affect our ability to market our products. We have established policies and implemented technical and operational measures designed to protect sensitive client information and respond to cybersecurity incidents. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that our systems will not be subject to successful attacks or breaches. Our liquidity and capital resources have remained a source of strength, and we believe cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. We also monitor and respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring our risk management strategy provides proactive protection during stress events.

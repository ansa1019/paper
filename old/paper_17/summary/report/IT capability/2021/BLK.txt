BlackRock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management (AUM) and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. The investment management industry is highly competitive, and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including investment performance, liquidity, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution, and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory clients are important elements of BlackRock's competitive success. BlackRock's Aladdin platform is central to its operations, combining risk analytics with portfolio management, trading, and operations tools. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers may weaken Aladdin's competitive position and may cause the company's revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock's ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands, and develop, market, and manage new investment products and services is critical for its financial performance. The company continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients, and operate efficiently. Anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. BlackRock is focused on enhancing Aladdin, with continued investment into areas such as whole portfolio, private markets, and a leading sustainable investing solution. The company is also investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth by migrating Aladdin from BlackRock-hosted data centers to the cloud, which will bring enhanced capabilities to BlackRock and its Aladdin clients. The migration, along with BlackRock's strategic partnership with Snowflake, aims to build Aladdin Data Cloud, a next-generation solution that will integrate Aladdin and non-Aladdin data, allowing clients to access and use data across their organization. BlackRock's strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions for both retail investors and institutions, including having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index, and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. The company is committed to helping clients build more resilient portfolios, integrating sustainability into technology, risk management, and product choice across BlackRock. The company's long-term strategy remains to keep alpha at the heart of BlackRock; accelerate growth in ETFs, illiquid alternatives, and technology; and deliver whole portfolio solutions. BlackRock's active platform reflects global reach, interconnectivity across teams and regions, growing data and insights, integrated technology and risk management, and scalable processes, which enables it to deliver more consistent outcomes for clients over the long term.

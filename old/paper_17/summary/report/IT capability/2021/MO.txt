Altria and its subsidiaries rely extensively on information systems, many of which are managed by third-party service providers, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including complying with regulatory, legal, financial reporting and tax requirements; engaging in marketing and e-commerce activities; managing and improving the effectiveness of operations; manufacturing and distributing products; collecting and storing sensitive data and confidential information; and communicating internally and externally with employees, investors, suppliers, trade customers, adult tobacco consumers and others. The failure of Altria's or its investees' information systems or service providers' or key suppliers' information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could have a material adverse effect on the business, reputation, consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria, its subsidiaries or its investees. Altria continues to make appropriate investments in administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect its information systems and data from cyber-threats, including human error and malicious acts. Altria's tobacco businesses face significant competition, and their failure to compete effectively could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or cash flows of Altria, or the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies and on Altria's ability to achieve its vision. Each of Altria's tobacco operating companies operates in highly competitive tobacco categories, where significant methods of competition include product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging, distribution and promotional activities. Altria's tobacco operating companies may be unsuccessful in anticipating changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences, responding to changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior or managing through difficult competitive and economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Altria or the business of Altria's tobacco operating companies. Altria's ability to implement its strategy of attracting and retaining the best talent may be impaired by the impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco regulation and control actions. The tobacco industry competes for talent with the consumer products industry and other companies that may enjoy greater societal acceptance and fewer longer-term challenges. Altria's investment in Juul subjects it to non-competition obligations restricting it from investing or engaging in the e-vapor business other than through Juul, subject to certain exceptions. Altria's tobacco operating companies and investees may not succeed in their efforts to develop and commercialize innovative products or processes, including tobacco products that may reduce the health risks associated with certain other tobacco products and that appeal to adult tobacco consumers, which may have an adverse effect on their ability to grow new revenue streams and/or put them at a competitive disadvantage and may also have an adverse effect on Altria's ability to achieve its vision. The expected benefits of the Juul transaction may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, including due to the risks encountered by Juul in its business, some of which are described in various risk factors above, such as operational risks, competitive risks and regulatory and legislative risks at the international, federal, state and local levels, including actions by the FDA, and adverse publicity due to underage use of e-vapor products. Altria continues to monitor the macroeconomic risks arising in part from the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor shortages, inflation and supply chain shortages, and continues to carefully evaluate potential outcomes and work to mitigate risks. Altria's critical information technology systems have remained operational, and while Altria's tobacco businesses previously suspended operations temporarily at several of their manufacturing facilities, the businesses resumed operations at those facilities under enhanced safety protocols.

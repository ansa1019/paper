Sempra's businesses own and operate electric transmission, distribution, and storage facilities, natural gas transmission, distribution, regasification, liquefaction, and storage facilities, which are interconnected and managed by information technology systems. The ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, improve, and upgrade these facilities and systems is critical, as risks include potential breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure and systems, human error, shortages of equipment, and operational restrictions from environmental requirements. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated substantial modifications to employee travel and work locations, increasing operational costs and impacting compliance requirements. Sempra's operational and structural risks are compounded by the performance of its subsidiaries, which depend on their ability to execute business strategies and generate cash flows. The company has substantial investments in businesses it does not control, exposing it to risks from decisions made by others that may not align with its interests. The operational risks are further heightened by evolving cybersecurity threats, necessitating robust information security measures to protect sensitive customer and employee information. Sempra's reliance on complex, interconnected networks of generation, transmission, distribution, and communication technologies underscores the importance of IT capability in supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. The company is also subject to regulatory requirements that impact its ability to recover costs associated with its operations, including those related to environmental compliance and climate change initiatives. The regulatory environment is dynamic, with potential changes that could affect the recovery of costs and the overall performance of its operations. Sempra's investment decisions are influenced by the need to maintain its credit ratings and ensure access to capital markets, which are critical for funding its capital expenditures and operational needs. The company's ability to manage its technology resources effectively is essential for achieving competitive advantage and operational flexibility. Additionally, Sempra's strategic resource allocation and investment processes are designed to leverage its IT capabilities to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. The integration of digital technologies into its operations is aimed at enhancing organizational effectiveness and improving performance metrics. As Sempra continues to navigate the challenges posed by regulatory changes, environmental factors, and competitive pressures, its focus on IT capability and the deployment of technology resources will be crucial in driving business transformation and achieving its strategic objectives. The companyâ€™s governance structures support the coordination of its assets and internal processes, facilitating effective decision-making and resource mobilization in response to evolving market conditions.

The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected our business, financial condition, and results of operations, with a material negative impact on our performance. The pandemic has strained the hospitality industry, leading to cancellations and reduced travel, which underscores the importance of our information technology systems in managing operations and responding to market dynamics. We depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business, which include sophisticated technology systems for property management, procurement, finance, human resources, reservations, distribution, and the operation of the Hilton Honors guest loyalty program. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from various factors, including cyber-attacks, which could adversely affect our operations. The effectiveness of our IT capabilities is critical to our ability to support business needs and enhance operational efficiency. We have implemented enhanced hygiene and cleaning standards, which rely on our IT systems for effective communication and coordination across our hotels. Our ability to maintain relationships with third-party property owners and franchisees is also influenced by our technology capabilities, as these relationships are essential for generating management and franchise fee revenues. The competitive landscape necessitates that we continuously evaluate and upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure we can respond to market demands and consumer preferences effectively. The reliance on third-party service providers for certain IT functions introduces additional risks, as any disruption in their services could impact our operational capabilities. Our management and franchise segment generates revenue from management and franchise fees charged to third-party hotel owners, which are closely tied to the performance of our IT systems in managing hotel operations and customer relationships. The quality of our technology systems impacts our ability to compete effectively in the hospitality industry, as competitors may have more efficient technology platforms that enhance their operational capabilities. Furthermore, our strategic objectives include expanding our global portfolio and fee-based business, which requires effective IT governance and resource allocation to support new management and franchise contracts. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is essential for optimizing our business processes and enhancing customer experiences. Our IT capabilities must evolve to address the challenges posed by the pandemic and the changing business environment, ensuring that we can leverage our technology resources to create value and maintain a competitive advantage. The successful deployment of our IT systems is vital for achieving operational flexibility and improving performance metrics across our hotels, particularly as we navigate the recovery from the pandemic and seek to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the hospitality market.

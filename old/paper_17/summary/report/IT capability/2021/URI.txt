Our business relies on information technology systems to monitor and control operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives, and support our online ordering system. Disruptions in these systems or failures to operate as expected could adversely affect our ability to access and use applications, limiting operational efficiency. We have experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, and we continuously develop and enhance our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems and data. The security measures we employ may not detect or prevent all attempts to compromise our systems, and any breaches could result in significant costs and resource expenditures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we faced increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and remote work, which could strain our technology resources and create vulnerabilities. Our reliance on information technology extends to our proprietary software application, Total ControlÂ®, which enables key customers to monitor and manage their equipment needs, enhancing customer relationships and service delivery. Our strategic management practices include a focus on operational efficiencies through the implementation of lean management techniques, which aim to improve service quality and reduce cycle times associated with renting equipment. We also pursue strategic acquisitions to expand our core equipment rental business, which necessitates the integration of information technology systems and processes to achieve anticipated synergies and operational efficiencies. The management of our technology portfolio is critical as we seek to leverage our IT capabilities to enhance business performance and competitive advantage. Our ability to effectively deploy and manage IT resources is essential in supporting business strategies and enhancing operational flexibility. We recognize the importance of aligning our technology capabilities with organizational goals and market demands, ensuring that our IT architecture supports our business processes and enhances our responsiveness to market dynamics. The integration of technology functionalities into our operations is a key component of our business transformation efforts, aimed at improving firm performance and achieving strategic objectives. We are committed to investing in our technology infrastructure to support our growth initiatives and enhance our competitive positioning in the market. Our IT governance framework is designed to ensure that our technology resources are effectively mobilized and deployed in alignment with our strategic priorities, facilitating innovation and operational excellence. The evolving landscape of digital technologies presents both challenges and opportunities, and we remain focused on leveraging our IT capabilities to navigate these dynamics and drive value creation across our organization.

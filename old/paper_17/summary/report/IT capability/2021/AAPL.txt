The company's business, results of operations, and financial condition depend substantially on the company's ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The company must make significant investments in research and development, which are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company's core business strategy. The company's products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, and rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors. The company has invested in manufacturing process equipment and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to ensure the supply of components and finished goods. The company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, and violations can materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers, which could result in disruption to the company's business and harm to the company's reputation. The company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by various events, which can adversely impact the company's business by preventing access to the company's online services and interfering with customer transactions. The company devotes significant resources to network and data security, but these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. The company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, and any failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers, and the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends on the developers' perception of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software. The company's reliance on third-party digital content providers and the potential for changes in licensing arrangements can also impact its ability to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices. The company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings, and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to the company's operations. The company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the company to potential liabilities and increased costs. The company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the company's employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations.

The ongoing covid-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations, and financial condition to a number of risks, including increased reliance on data and technology systems and the associated risks of cybersecurity incidents. Our business model and operations involve risks related to our ability to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us, as well as the impacts of severe cold and flu seasons or other widespread illnesses on occupancy, which may affect our operators' ability to make payments. The financial condition or results of operations of our tenants could be adversely affected by controls imposed by medicare, medicaid, and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, which could impact our revenue. Our operators and tenants are subject to risks arising from the unique pressures on seniors housing and medical practice employees during the covid-19 pandemic, including labor shortages resulting from macroeconomic trends, which may affect operational efficiency and business performance. We regularly monitor and review our rights and remedies under our management agreements, which may involve significant legal and operational risks. Our reliance on data and technology systems is critical, and any disruptions could adversely impact our business. The ability of our operators to manage and operate properties effectively, including compliance with laws and regulations, is essential to our revenue generation and overall firm performance. Our investment strategy includes evaluating opportunities for acquisitions and joint ventures, which requires a thorough understanding of market dynamics and the competitive landscape. The effectiveness of our IT capabilities in supporting these operations is vital, as it encompasses the coordination of assets, internal processes, and interfirm transactions. We have experienced increased operational costs due to the introduction of public health measures and additional health and safety measures adopted in response to the pandemic, which may become standard practice. The ability to leverage technology resources and manage information effectively is crucial for maintaining operational flexibility and achieving strategic objectives. Our management practices emphasize the importance of aligning technology capabilities with business needs to enhance performance and support decision-making processes. The integration of IT systems and the deployment of digital technologies are essential for optimizing our operational processes and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Our organizational capabilities are continuously assessed to identify opportunities for improvement and to respond to emerging challenges in the market. The ongoing evaluation of our technology infrastructure and investment choices is critical to maintaining a competitive advantage and achieving long-term business value.

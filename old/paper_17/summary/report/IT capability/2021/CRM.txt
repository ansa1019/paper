The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial, health, and other personal information. Our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes, and internal security controls is critical in mitigating risks. The detection, prevention, and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities may result in additional financial burdens due to costs associated with infrastructure capacity spending and the reallocation of resources from development activities. Our ability to effectively support business needs has become a key factor in transforming our firm into a competitive force. We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems and processes, and if the implementations of these new applications are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problems, our operations could be negatively impacted. The complexity of integrating acquired technologies into our services may also present challenges. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for the delivery of services to our customers. We may face increased risks of cyberattack attempts or security threats as our market presence grows, which could result in unauthorized access to our IT systems or data. Our ability to provide high-quality technical support services is essential for maintaining customer relationships and ensuring operational efficiency. The evolving regulatory environment surrounding privacy concerns and data protection laws may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. We are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to government contracts, which could impact our ability to compete effectively in international markets. Our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands, which is critical to expanding our customer base. The markets for our offerings are highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and we may not succeed in keeping pace with technological developments. Our efforts to expand our service offerings and develop and integrate existing services may not succeed, potentially reducing our revenue growth rate. The integration of acquired companies, such as Slack, presents complexities that could disrupt our business operations and dilute stockholder value. We have experienced significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our operational and financial infrastructure. Our ability to scale operations and increase productivity is vital to successfully implementing our business plan. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our supply chain and may continue to affect our operations. Our business and reputation could be harmed if customers perceive our services as unreliable due to service interruptions or delays. We continue to invest in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers. Our strategic investments in complementary businesses and technologies are aimed at expanding our service offerings and nurturing the overall ecosystem for our offerings. The evolving landscape of digital technologies requires us to continuously enhance our services to meet changing customer demands and maintain competitive advantage.

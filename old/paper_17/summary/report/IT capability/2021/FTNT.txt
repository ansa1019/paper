Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, including our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and services to existing end-customers. Our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable due to factors such as component shortages, inventory management, and the level of demand for our products and services. The effectiveness of our sales organization and the timing of channel partner and end-customer orders are critical, as is our reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of each quarter. Our ability to capitalize on the convergence of networking and security, vendor consolidation of various cybersecurity solutions, and other growth drivers is essential. We have implemented a cloud-based quoting tool to enhance sales productivity, although our ability to integrate data from this tool into our order processing may cause delays. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and the economic health of our customers. Weak economic conditions and reduced information technology spending could adversely impact our business, leading to longer sales cycles and lower prices for our products and services. Our revenue growth is driven by both product and service revenue, with a significant portion derived from fortiguard security subscription services and forticare technical support services. The growth of our customer base, the expansion of service bundle offerings, and the renewal of service contracts are critical to our service revenue growth. We rely heavily on information technology to manage critical functions such as order configuration, pricing, revenue recognition, and inventory management. Our internal enterprise IT networks, operational networks, and research and development networks are vital to our success. We are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and any breach of our networks could harm our reputation and financial performance. Our success depends on the market's confidence in our ability to provide effective network security protection. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial, operating, security, and administrative systems and controls. Our failure to enhance these systems could undermine our ability to manage business growth and accurately forecast revenue and expenses. Additionally, we must manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently to support our operational effectiveness. Our investments in research and development are crucial for product innovation, and we expect these expenses to increase as we expand our workforce to drive growth. Our sales and marketing expenses are also expected to rise as we aim to capture market share. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have created challenges, including supply chain disruptions and increased costs for components. We have taken steps to mitigate these challenges by increasing our on-hand stock of certain products and securing capacity with suppliers. Our ability to manage our inventory effectively is critical to our operational efficiency and financial performance. The complexity of managing inventory, particularly during periods of product shortages, can lead to lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and achieving our organizational goals.

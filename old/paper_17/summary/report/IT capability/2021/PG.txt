The company relies extensively on information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems, networks, and services, including data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, to assist in conducting business. These IT/OT systems are utilized for various functions, including ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, and managing banking and cash liquidity systems. The company faces numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, which pose risks to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data and critical business operations. A significant information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could materially adversely impact the business or reputation. The company cannot guarantee that security efforts will prevent material breaches or operational incidents. If IT/OT systems fail to function properly or cause operational outages, it may result in interruptions in the ability to manage operations and expose the company to reputational, competitive, operational, financial, and business harm.

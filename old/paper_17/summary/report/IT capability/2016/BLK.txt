As a global investment management firm, BlackRock recognizes that the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, have altered the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to fee compression or require BlackRock to spend more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with products and services offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory, or asset management firms. The sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via the Aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients are an important element of BlackRock's competitive success. Aladdin's competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine sophisticated risk analytics with comprehensive portfolio management, trading, and operations tools on a single platform. BlackRock's infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock's business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock's control, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business, or impede its growth. BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures, and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus, phishing scam, or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. BlackRock's reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt BlackRock's operations and result in misappropriation, corruption, or loss of personal, confidential, or proprietary information. The company collaborates with clients, vendors, and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information. Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling, or misuse of personal, confidential, or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm, or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline. BlackRock's ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform is crucial, as the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin analytical calculations. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or information, or disruption of such information flows, could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock's ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. The company continues to invest in technology, training, and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures.

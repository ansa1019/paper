The growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. The increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips and integrated circuits has led to a focus on managing costs, which could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity. Demand for our products and services could decrease if growth in these industries slows or stalls. The semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems, with many customers outsourcing the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries and incorporating third-party IP into their designs. We work closely with major foundries to ensure compatibility of our EDA, IP, and manufacturing solutions with their processes. If we fail to optimize our solutions for use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or if access to such foundry processes is hampered, our solutions may become less desirable to our customers. Consolidation among our customers and within the industries may negatively impact our operating results. Our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenue poses risks, as reduced spending or loss of these customers could adversely affect our business. We and our competitors acquire businesses and technologies to expand our product offerings; if competitors consolidate or acquire technologies that we do not offer, they may provide a larger technology portfolio or lower prices, negatively impacting our business. The global economy's uncertainty may negatively affect our business and financial condition, as semiconductor companies may behave cautiously and focus on costs, including R&D budgets. Continuing caution by semiconductor companies could limit our ability to maintain or increase sales. We pursue new product and technology initiatives, and if we fail to innovate or introduce new products timely, we may lose our competitive position. Our success in adjacent markets, including software quality, testing, and security solutions, depends on attracting a new customer base and developing new sales strategies. We rely on a global network of infrastructure applications and technology systems for our operations, and disruptions could adversely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations. Cybersecurity threats could compromise sensitive information and harm our business and reputation. Our software products may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, which could disrupt their functioning and lead to unauthorized access to proprietary information. We face risks related to recruiting and retaining key employees, as competition for qualified personnel is intense. Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations, increasing compliance costs and risks of noncompliance. Changes in accounting principles could significantly impact our reported results and require changes to our internal accounting systems. We make significant investments in research and development, and if these investments do not yield products that generate revenue, our financial results could be negatively affected. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, and violations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Our financial statements are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and we may be unable to hedge all foreign currency risk. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and available credit will satisfy our business requirements for the foreseeable future.

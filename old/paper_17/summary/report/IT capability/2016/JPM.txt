JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations are subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which increases the firm's operational and compliance costs. The firm's ability to process, record, and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions is critical, as the speed, frequency, volume, and complexity of transactions increase, thereby raising the risk of human and/or systems error. The effective functioning of the firm's operational systems is dependent on the competence and reliability of its employees, as well as the employees of third parties on whom the firm relies for technological support. The firm's operational systems and infrastructure must meet increasingly demanding standards, and any significant operational breakdown or failure could materially and adversely affect the firm. The firm's reliance on data to aggregate and assess its various risk exposures means that deficiencies in data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting. Furthermore, the firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the firm, and failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships could result in potential liability to clients and customers. The firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, but there are inherent limitations to these strategies. The firm's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss, yet the firm may not effectively identify every risk, resulting in potential losses. The firm's operational systems are also vulnerable to disruptions arising from events beyond its control, including security breaches, natural disasters, and other significant events. The interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution may cause an industry-wide operational failure. The firm's businesses are dependent on the effectiveness and integrity of its processes, operational systems, and employees, and failures in these areas could materially and adversely affect the firm's operations. Additionally, the firm is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information, which can increase operating costs and impact the development of new products or services. The firm's ability to safeguard personal information is critical, as any mishandling or misuse could expose the firm to litigation or regulatory sanctions. The firm maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program to recover critical business functions in the event of a business interruption, but there is no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate potential risks. The firm's operational systems and technology assets are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties, and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks poses a significant risk. The firm devotes significant resources to maintain and upgrade its systems, yet it may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches. The firm's competitive standing and future results of operations could be adversely affected by any significant failure to manage its operational and technological capabilities effectively.

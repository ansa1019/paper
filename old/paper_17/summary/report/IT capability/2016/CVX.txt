Chevron's operations are subject to numerous risks, including those related to cybersecurity and digital infrastructure, which could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations. The company has experienced cyber incidents of varying degrees, which could result in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or assets, access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse, or corruption of critical data and proprietary information. Cyber threat actors could compromise critical systems and infrastructure, leading to significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, and reputational harm. The company's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency, incorporating potential ranges of physical risks into capital investment reviews and decisions. The company seeks to minimize operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting operations in a safe and reliable manner, yet failure to manage these risks effectively could impair its ability to operate. Additionally, the company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources, and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations arising from significant incidents or unforeseen liabilities. The changing economic, regulatory, and political environments in the various countries where Chevron operates can also affect its operations, particularly exploration and production. Actions taken by governments could impose additional taxes or royalties, or restrict the company's operations, which might harm its competitiveness. The company integrates considerations of greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related policy actions into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations is difficult to predict and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws enacted and market conditions. Changes in management's estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company's financial or operational performance. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant, and equipment; estimates of recoverable reserves; and accruals for estimated liabilities. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure. The ultimate impact of greenhouse gas emissions-related agreements, legislation, and measures on the company's financial performance is highly uncertain, as it is difficult to predict the outcome of political decision-making processes and the variables involved. The company's operations are also subject to liability risks from litigation or government action, which could arise from the handling of potentially toxic materials and pollutants. The company has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes, and compliance mechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability, and efficiency risks, and to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, it may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control risks effectively.

Duke Energy's future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy, which includes transforming the customer experience, modernizing the energy grid, and generating cleaner energy. The company's strategy is subject to business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control. The ability to recover costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis is crucial, as regulatory bodies may not allow recovery, negatively impacting future earnings. The electric rates charged by Duke Energy's regulated utility businesses significantly influence their results of operations and financial position. The regulation of these rates is determined largely by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings, and negative decisions made by these regulators could materially affect the company's results of operations and financial condition. 

Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect Duke Energy's financial position. The company cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets, nor can it foresee changes in legislation or regulation and their impacts on financial performance. Duke Energy's businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation and a variety of laws and governmental policies, which may change over time, affecting operations and costs. 

The company has recognized significant asset retirement obligations related to compliance with environmental regulations, which may require substantial capital expenditures. Compliance with these regulations can necessitate significant expenditures, including cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. The costs associated with compliance may not be fully recoverable through existing regulatory rate structures and contracts with customers. 

Duke Energy's operational risks include overall market, economic, and other conditions that are beyond its control, which can negatively affect results of operations. Economic downturns can reduce demand for electricity and natural gas, leading to diminished revenues and cash flows. The company also faces risks related to natural disasters and operational accidents, which could impact its operating results and financial condition. 

The integration of Piedmont Natural Gas is expected to provide various benefits, including cost savings and efficiencies. However, achieving these anticipated benefits is subject to uncertainties, including the efficient integration of Piedmont's business. The company is also exposed to risks associated with cyberattacks and data security breaches, which could disrupt business operations and lead to substantial financial losses. 

Duke Energy's ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce is critical, as challenges in this area could negatively affect results of operations. The company is committed to compliance with safety enhancements ordered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which may necessitate substantial capital expenditures. The regulatory landscape is continuously evolving, and the company cannot predict the future course of regulatory changes or their ultimate effects on its business. 

Duke Energy's financial performance is also influenced by its ability to effectively manage its technology resources and investments, which are essential for supporting business strategies and operational efficiency. The company must navigate a complex regulatory environment while pursuing its strategic objectives, including investments in cleaner energy and modernization of its infrastructure.

The company’s business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology. The company relies on its technology systems for conducting business and processing claims, as well as for providing the data and analytics utilized to manage its business. It is essential to maintain the effectiveness of existing technology systems and to continue developing and enhancing technology systems that support business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource-efficient manner. The company recognizes that system development projects may negatively impact expense ratios as investments are made and may not deliver the expected benefits or performance. If the company does not effectively manage and upgrade its technology portfolio, or if the costs of doing so exceed expectations, its ability to provide competitive services and implement strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted. The company is also exposed to risks associated with technology, data, and network security, including cyber-attacks, which could significantly impair its ability to perform necessary business functions. The reliance on third-party systems, including cloud-based technologies, adds another layer of risk, as service denials or failures of controls could result from demand exceeding capacity or third-party system failures. The company’s operations depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information in its computer systems and networks, which are regularly targeted by cyber threats. The company attempts to develop secure transmission capabilities with third-party vendors, but may be unable to ensure adequate protection for all information. The company’s ability to conduct business and its results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by breaches of data security or other disruptions. The company’s investment strategy focuses on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio, which is critical for funding future claims payments. The company employs a conservative investment philosophy, with a significant majority of funds deployed in a diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid investments. The investment portfolio is managed to support insurance operations, ensuring that adequate funds are available to satisfy insurance liabilities. The company utilizes various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage exposure to catastrophic events. The company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and calibrates its proprietary modeling processes accordingly. The company’s catastrophe models may be less reliable due to increased unpredictability in the frequency and severity of severe weather events. The company also recognizes that changing climate conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued, impacting its financial position. The integration of technology into business processes is crucial for maintaining competitiveness in a rapidly evolving market, as traditional insurance industry participants and new entrants leverage technology to enhance customer experience and operational efficiencies. The company must anticipate and adapt to these technological changes to avoid potential disruptions in its competitive position.

We rely extensively on information technology systems ("IT systems"), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to: communicating within the company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; receiving and processing orders from and shipping products to our customers; marketing products to consumers; collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers and vendors; hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; complying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes involved in managing our business. Although we have a broad array of information security measures in place, our IT systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers', IT systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. In addition, while we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by the company or its third-party service providers is securely maintained, data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur. If we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our IT systems, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, civil litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our IT systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events and, if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business, as well as reputational harm and litigation, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The 2012 restructuring program's initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses. The major objectives of the program include becoming even stronger on the ground through the continued evolution and expansion of proven global and regional commercial capabilities, which have already been successfully implemented in a number of the company's operations around the world, and simplifying and standardizing how work gets done by increasing technology-enabled collaboration and taking advantage of global data and analytic capabilities, leading to smarter and faster decisions.

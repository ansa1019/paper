AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could adversely affect AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Additionally, AbbVie’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of its merger with Pharmacyclics will depend on its ability to effectively and profitably commercialize Imbruvica, including ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers Imbruvica to AbbVie’s customers. AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and there are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with complex regulations, which could disrupt AbbVie’s business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. AbbVie’s financial performance is also influenced by changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards and environmental laws. The company is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. Changes in business, economic and political conditions, including war, political instability, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and labor disputes, may also adversely affect AbbVie’s business. Furthermore, AbbVie’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers. The company regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances and establishes an allowance against accounts receivable when it is probable they will not be collected. AbbVie also monitors the potential for and periodically utilizes factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk. The company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support its growth objectives.

Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. The reliability of these information technology systems is critical to many of Nike's operating activities and business processes. Nike's ability to effectively manage and maintain its inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. The company has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions in which it operates, and its work to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems and related processes in global operations is ongoing. Nike will continue to invest in these efforts, as the failure of these systems to operate effectively could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations, requiring significant capital investments to remediate problems and potentially adversely affecting reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. 

The company's direct-to-consumer operations have required substantial investment in information systems, and failures in technology-based systems that facilitate online shopping could materially adversely affect its operating results and ability to grow its e-commerce business globally. Nike's reliance on information technology extends to digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement, and the marketing and use of its digital products and services. Any interruption in its information technology systems may impede its ability to engage in the digital space, resulting in lost revenues and damage to its reputation. The company also faces risks related to data security and privacy, as it collects sensitive and proprietary business information, including transactional and personal information about customers. Any breach of its network may result in the loss of valuable business data or personal information, leading to reputational damage and potential legal repercussions.

Nike's commitment to operational excellence includes investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste, and have long-term potential to increase both customization of products and speed to market. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform itself into a competitive force. The integration and enhancement of its information technology capabilities are essential for sustaining growth and profitability, particularly in an increasingly complex and competitive market environment. The company's strategic resource allocation includes investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, particularly in digital capabilities, which are vital for maintaining its competitive advantage in the athletic footwear and apparel industry.

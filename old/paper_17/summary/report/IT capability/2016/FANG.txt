The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including the risk of not being able to successfully integrate acquired properties or to realize anticipated revenues or other benefits from acquisitions. Our ability to achieve anticipated benefits from acquisitions will depend in part on whether we can integrate the acquired properties into our existing businesses efficiently and effectively. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves, availability and cost of transportation, and our ability to obtain external financing. The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing, and accounting data. If any of these programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information, it could materially affect our business operations. Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water, which is essential for oil and natural gas production. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to mitigate risks associated with fluctuations in the price of crude oil. We recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value, and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive. We are also subject to cybersecurity risks, as our technologies, systems, and networks may become targets of cyberattacks or information security breaches. The oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid technological advancements, and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if we cannot keep pace with these developments. Our ability to acquire additional properties and discover reserves will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties in a highly competitive environment. We face intense competition for acquisition opportunities, and the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves and operating costs. The integration process may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on whether significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods. Our operations are also subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including potential environmental impacts and regulatory changes. The adoption of climate change legislation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. We monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities, changes in prices, and other factors both within and outside our control. If we require additional capital, we may seek such capital through traditional reserve base borrowings, joint venture partnerships, or other means. We cannot assure you that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.

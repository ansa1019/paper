The company relies on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data. These systems support a variety of critical business processes and activities. The company’s information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, and other cyber-attacks, which are expected to increase in sophistication and frequency. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, these systems could adversely affect the company’s operations, delay production and shipments, damage customer relationships, and result in legal claims and proceedings. The company emphasizes the importance of maintaining reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements to prevent data breaches. The company is subject to various data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions, which require maintaining controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of sensitive data. The company’s operations are also affected by worldwide, regional, and industry-specific economic and political factors, including rapid technological development, which impacts its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and market segments. The company is making significant investments, both organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development, and customer-facing resources. The company’s growth depends on its ability to develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of its sales force, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. The company’s success will depend on its ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences, allocate research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects, and anticipate and respond to competitors' technological innovations. The integration of acquired businesses is expected to realize significant cost synergies through the application of the company’s business system and combined purchasing power. The company’s financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities, and it faces risks associated with the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain served industries. The company’s ability to grow revenues, earnings, and cash flow at or above historic rates depends in part upon its ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices. The company’s growth could suffer if the markets into which it sells its products and services decline or do not grow as anticipated. The company’s operations, products, and services expose it to the risk of environmental, health, and safety liabilities, costs, and violations that could adversely affect its business and reputation. The company’s reliance on information technology systems and the effectiveness of its IT governance are critical to its operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness.

We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, including those arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions. As our business has expanded globally, we have increasingly become subject to risks that could impact technology purchases, resulting in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of our technologies. Our financial performance may be negatively impacted by the lack of credit available to key channel partners, counterparty failures affecting our treasury functions, and decreased borrowing and spending by our end users. The transition from personal computer to cloud, mobile, and social computing reflects a significant shift in our business model, requiring considerable investment in technical, financial, legal, and sales resources to support our cloud-based products and more flexible product licenses. We have accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible product licenses, which necessitates a scalable organization and the ability to include functionality and usability in offerings that address customer requirements. Our strategy to develop and introduce new products exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance and costs related to product defects. Rapid technological changes and shifts in customer requirements characterize the software industry, necessitating constant evaluation of our business model and strategy. We are focused on providing solutions that enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative, which involves significant resources devoted to the development of new technologies and the introduction of flexible license and service offerings. The adoption of our cloud and mobile computing offerings will change the way we recognize revenue, potentially negatively impacting our financial performance. Our entry into 3D printing presents additional risks, including competition from established players and the potential for product liability. We are making investments through the enhancement of existing products and services, as well as through acquisitions of new product lines, although these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs. Our business model transition metrics, including annualized recurring revenue and growth of subscriptions, reflect our performance during this transition, which has been characterized by a decline in maintenance subscription revenue and an increase in new model subscriptions. We rely significantly on our distributor and reseller network, which is critical for generating revenue. The financial condition of our distributors and resellers can impact our ability to generate revenue, as their financial instability could lead to reduced sales and customer support services. We are also subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows. The reliance on third-party technologies and the integration of these technologies into our products are essential for our product and service development. Our ability to manage and leverage IT capabilities effectively is crucial for supporting our business strategies and enhancing our operational efficiency, particularly as we navigate the complexities of our business model transition and the associated risks.

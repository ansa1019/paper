Berkshire relies on information technology in virtually all aspects of its business, with significant dependence on the effectiveness of its information technology systems. A disruption or failure of these systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, and operational difficulties. Cybersecurity risks are prevalent, as attacks on information systems could lead to loss of assets and critical information, exposing the company to remediation costs and reputational damage. The company has implemented business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning, and business impact analysis to mitigate these risks; however, a significant disruption could still adversely affect operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Furthermore, the inability to acquire or implement new technology may result in a competitive disadvantage, negatively impacting results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The company acknowledges that competition and technology may erode business franchises and result in lower earnings, as intense competitive pressures exist within the markets it operates. Future operating results will depend on the success of its operating units in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. The company’s decentralized business model necessitates qualified personnel to manage and operate various businesses effectively, and changes in demographics or availability of qualified personnel could negatively impact operations.

The company’s insurance businesses, which are critical to its overall performance, are subject to regulatory changes that may adversely impact operating results and capital allocation. Regulatory compliance costs could significantly affect operations, and the company is also subject to risks from economic cycles that may impair its ability to access capital markets. The company’s operational flexibility is essential for adapting to market dynamics, and its ability to manage and deploy IT resources effectively is crucial for maintaining competitive positioning and achieving business objectives. The management's focus on strategic resource allocation and investment decisions is vital for enhancing operational efficiency and ensuring alignment with organizational goals. The company recognizes that its IT capabilities are integral to transforming business processes and enhancing firm performance, as well as to supporting innovation and responding to external influences in the market.

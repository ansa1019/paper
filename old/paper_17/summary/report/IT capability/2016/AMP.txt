Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including technological changes and events, which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. The availability and cost of capital, as well as the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices, and interest rates, are influenced by market dynamics and external influences. The profitability of our products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, which can be impacted by market downturns and volatility. Investment performance is an important factor in the success of many of our businesses, and poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth. The competitive landscape is characterized by intense competition, where we compete based on service quality, investment performance, product offerings, and perceived financial strength. Our businesses operate in a heavily regulated environment, and changes to laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. 

Our financial condition and results of operations may also be adversely affected by changes in consumer economic variables, such as the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, which could impact client activity across our businesses. The success of our strategies may be affected by various factors, including the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, as well as the performance of our investment management products and services. The integration of technology into our operations is critical, as we rely on internal and third-party personnel and technology systems to process, transmit, and store information, including sensitive client and proprietary information. Maintaining the integrity of these systems is essential for operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. 

We have implemented policies designed to protect sensitive client information and have developed comprehensive business continuity plans to address potential disruptions. However, our operational systems and networks are subject to evolving cybersecurity risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client information and damage to our reputation. The ability to offer appropriate product alternatives in response to market volatility is crucial for maintaining sales and management fee revenues. Our investment management services and financial advice are contingent upon the effectiveness of our technology infrastructure and the ability to manage risks associated with market fluctuations. 

We continuously evaluate our investment strategies and technology capabilities to ensure alignment with our business objectives. The deployment of technology resources is integral to our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. Our strategic resource allocation decisions are influenced by the need to enhance our IT capabilities, which have evolved to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is essential for achieving competitive advantage and facilitating innovation. The management of our technology portfolio is critical for optimizing performance and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. As we navigate the complexities of the financial services industry, our focus remains on leveraging our IT capabilities to enhance business value and drive organizational transformation.

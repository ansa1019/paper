The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs; our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition; the ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to lower cost structures and regulatory and legislative actions adverse to us; our ability to manage growth in wireless video and data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms; changes in our corporate strategies, such as changing network-related requirements or acquisitions and dispositions, which may require significant amounts of cash or stock, to respond to competition and regulatory, legislative and technological developments; and our ability to adequately fund our wireless operations, including payment for additional spectrum, network upgrades and technological advancements. Additionally, our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies or delivery methods, and the extent of competition including from governmental networks and other providers, could impact our operational efficiency and market-based performance. The final outcome of FCC and other federal, state or foreign government agency proceedings involving issues that are important to our business, including the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, also plays a critical role in our IT capabilities and overall firm performance. Moreover, our ability to integrate our acquisition of DirecTV and close our pending acquisition of Time Warner Inc. and successfully integrate its operations is essential for leveraging our technology resources and enhancing our strategic capabilities. The impact from major equipment failures on our networks, including security breaches related to the network or customer information, and our inability to obtain handsets, equipment/software in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers, further underscores the importance of effective IT governance and management skills. Our ability to maintain margins, attract and offer a diverse portfolio of wireless service and devices, and the availability and cost of additional wireless spectrum are also crucial factors that influence our IT effectiveness and organizational capabilities. The uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions may result in a significant decrease in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general, which could affect our business environment and strategic resource allocation. The uncertainty and impact of anticipated regulatory and corporate tax reform may also impact the overall economy and incentives for business investments, thereby influencing our IT deployment and operational flexibility. Overall, the evolving landscape of technology and competition necessitates a robust approach to managing our IT capabilities to ensure alignment with business strategies and to enhance our competitive advantage in the market.

The company depends on information technology to enable efficient operations and maintain financial accuracy. Its information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. If the company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, it could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and business disruptions. The security of the company's information technology systems could be compromised, adversely affecting its ability to operate. The company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of sensitive information, which is critical to its operations. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and constantly changing requirements. The company is subject to operational, economic, political, and legal risks that could impact profitability, particularly in developing markets where it is investing significant capital and resources. The success of its operations will depend, in part, on its ability to manage risks inherent in these markets, including unfamiliar regulatory environments and relationships with local partners. The company's financial results may also be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving antitrust and environmental matters, which could lead to significant fines and sanctions. The company's operations could be impacted by catastrophic events, including severe weather conditions and acts of terrorism, which could disrupt its ability to produce and distribute products. The company's reliance on information technology extends to its ability to interface with customers and maintain operational efficiency. The company’s information systems have been subject to sophisticated cyber security threats, and while it has not experienced significant impacts to date, unauthorized access could disrupt business operations and result in material adverse effects. The company is also focused on developing technologies to help reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency, which could create new opportunities in response to regulatory pressures regarding greenhouse gas emissions. The company’s ability to recover increased energy and raw material costs from customers is uncertain, and fluctuations in these costs could negatively impact its financial performance. The company’s operational results are dependent on its ability to maintain and replace aging assets, and it must manage the risks associated with its capital expenditures and investments in technology and infrastructure. The company has policies and procedures in place to foster compliance with laws and regulations, but violations could lead to investigations and penalties that may adversely affect its financial results. The company’s strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are critical to its ability to leverage technology capabilities and enhance operational efficiency, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in the market.

Cybersecurity incidents affecting the company's information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information, resulting in adverse impacts to the company's reputation and operating results. Cybersecurity threats continue to expand and evolve globally, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the company. The company has been and expects to continue to be a target of various cybersecurity attacks, including ransomware attacks.

The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements, privacy laws, and regulations around the world, which impose significant obligations for companies on how they collect, store, protect, process, and transfer personal data. The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with any existing and forthcoming information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on the company's financial results. The company has experienced difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses, which may impact its operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation.

The company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business, and rapid technological changes could lead to the entry of new competitors of various sizes against whom it may not be able to successfully compete. The companyâ€™s sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments, which are subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints. The company has focused its research and development efforts through close collaboration with its customers to develop highly engineered products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a one- to three-year period.

The company believes that these sources of liquidity, along with access to capital markets, provide adequate liquidity to meet both its short-term and reasonably foreseeable long-term requirements and obligations.

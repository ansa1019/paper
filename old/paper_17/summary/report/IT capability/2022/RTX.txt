Our business may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, international relations, and geopolitical events, which can impact our operating results and financial condition. The current global supply chain and labor market challenges have negatively affected our performance and that of our suppliers. We may be unable to increase our contract value or pricing to offset cost increases, particularly on fixed-price contracts, which could adversely affect our operating profits and margins. Additionally, tightening credit in financial markets could adversely affect our customers' ability to obtain financing, resulting in decreased orders for our products and services. Our operations are influenced by changes in U.S. government defense spending, which could negatively impact our financial position and liquidity. The termination of government contracts or performance delays could negatively impact our competitive position and results of operations. Our business is subject to extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations, and we may face technological and performance difficulties in developing advanced defense and technology systems. We invest substantial amounts in research and development to pursue advancements in technologies aimed at meeting customer needs, and our ability to realize anticipated benefits depends on various factors, including execution of performance plans and achieving cost efficiencies. We are also subject to risks associated with cybersecurity threats to our IT infrastructure, which could disrupt our operations and result in unauthorized access to confidential information. Our business relies on the availability of materials and the performance of our suppliers, and disruptions in the supply chain could hinder our ability to meet customer commitments. We continuously monitor labor market conditions and work to mitigate constraints through talent acquisition and workforce succession planning. Our strategic initiatives, including a significant digital transformation initiative, aim to improve our business processes and operational efficiencies. However, if we do not successfully manage these initiatives, expected efficiencies and benefits may be delayed or not realized. We face competition from both U.S. and foreign companies, and our ability to compete successfully is critical to our financial performance. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits and investigations, which may result in adjustments to contract prices and could negatively impact our results of operations. We are also exposed to risks related to changes in laws and regulations, including those affecting our ability to operate internationally. Our financial performance is dependent on the aerospace industry, which is cyclical and influenced by various factors, including economic conditions and government spending. We must comply with various laws and regulations related to the export and import of products and technology, and any failure to comply could result in significant penalties. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is critical to our operations, and we face challenges in hiring due to a competitive labor market. We rely on our IT capabilities to support our business needs and enhance operational efficiency, and any disruptions to our IT systems could adversely affect our performance.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including technological changes and events, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. The evolving nature of market conditions, regulatory actions, and competitive industry environments necessitates that we continually assess and invest in our technology resources to maintain operational efficiency and competitive advantage. The financial services industry has always been highly competitive, and our ability to attract, motivate, engage, and retain qualified personnel is critical to our success. We rely on our network of advisors to drive growth and results in our wealth management business, and the recruitment environment for financial advisors is highly competitive. Our investment performance is a key competitive factor for our retail and institutional asset management products and services, and strong investment performance helps to ensure the retention of our products and services by our clients. Changes in consumer economic variables may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality, impacting client activity across our businesses. We face intense competition from larger competitors who may have greater investments in technology and analytics, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Our ability to manage risks effectively is influenced by our use of observed historical experience or expectations about future experience, which may not always predict future exposures accurately. The development and introduction of new products and services require significant time, resources, and ongoing support, and substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with these initiatives. Our operational systems and networks are subject to evolving cybersecurity risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information and damage to our reputation. We have established policies and implemented technical and operational measures to protect sensitive client, employee, contractor, and vendor information, and to respond to cybersecurity incidents. However, we cannot guarantee that our systems and networks will not be subject to successful attacks or breaches. Our financial performance relies on our ability to develop, effectively manage, and market new or existing products that appropriately anticipate or respond to changes in the industry and evolving client demands. The integration of acquired businesses into our operations is a time-consuming process that incurs both expected and unexpected costs, and our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions could adversely impair our business. We must manage our business within the expectations of various regulations and capital requirements, which may impact our ability to offer cost-effective and innovative products to our clients. Our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and cash generated by our operations, and we believe our cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, and access to debt markets will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term operating liquidity needs. We are also dependent on our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to meet our obligations, and any restrictions on their ability to pay dividends could adversely impact our financial condition.

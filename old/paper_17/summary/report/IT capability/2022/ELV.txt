In evaluating our business, we recognize that our information technology systems are critical to our operations and overall performance. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems, which require ongoing investment and commitment of resources to maintain and enhance existing systems, as well as to develop new systems that keep pace with changes in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risks. The failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information systems, or the availability and integrity of our data, could adversely affect our business. We have been subject to cyber-attacks and other privacy or data security incidents that could disrupt our operations and expose us to liability under various laws. Our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are regularly targeted by cyber threats, which necessitates the continued development and enhancement of our controls and processes designed to protect our systems and data. The volume of healthcare data generated is rapidly expanding, and our ability to develop, implement, and support new and existing products and services depends on the integrity of this data and our information systems. Connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important, with trends driving greater consumer engagement in healthcare. Therefore, the pace at which our customers will need enhanced technologies with sophisticated applications will continue to expand. Our strategic management practices include the evaluation of our experience in public exchange markets, which influences our premium rates and geographic participation. We face intense competition in many of our markets, and our ability to adapt to changes in our industry and develop strategic growth opportunities is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. Our IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, supporting our business strategies and enhancing operational efficiency. We are committed to leveraging technology resources and capabilities to improve our organizational effectiveness and to meet the changing needs of our customers. The integration of technology into our business processes is vital for optimizing our operations and enhancing our service delivery. Our IT governance framework ensures that we manage our technology investments effectively, aligning them with our strategic objectives and regulatory requirements. The challenges we face in managing our IT capabilities include ensuring information reliability, security, and compliance with evolving regulations. Our management skills and organizational capabilities are crucial in navigating these challenges and in mobilizing resources to support our strategic initiatives. We continuously monitor and assess our technology infrastructure to ensure it meets our operational needs and supports our long-term growth objectives. The effectiveness of our IT systems is integral to our overall business performance, influencing our ability to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands.

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, including our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and services to existing end-customers. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and the economic health of our current and prospective customers. Weak global and regional economic conditions, including a possible recession and reduced information technology spending, may adversely impact our business. The purchase of our products is often discretionary and may involve a significant commitment of capital and other resources. We may be adversely affected by inflation, rising interest rates, and economic downturns, which could negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. Our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable due to factors outside of our control, including economic conditions and the effectiveness of our sales organization. We rely on third-party channel partners for substantially all of our revenue, and if our partners fail to perform, our ability to sell our products and services will be limited. Additionally, we depend on our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities and to manage our sales process. The effectiveness of our sales organization is critical, and we may face execution risks associated with capturing opportunities related to growth drivers, including the convergence of networking and security. Our investments in sales and marketing are essential to support our growth, and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars. We also rely on information technology to manage critical functions such as order configuration, pricing, revenue recognition, and inventory management. Our ability to improve and expand our information technology systems and processes is crucial for managing growth effectively. We have been slow to adopt certain automated functions, which could negatively impact our business. Our internal enterprise IT networks and operational networks, which connect to customers and vendors, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. We are also exposed to risks related to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the severity and unpredictability of risks associated with our business operations. We must continue to improve our systems, processes, and controls to manage future growth effectively. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for components exposes us to risks related to supply chain disruptions, which could impair our ability to fulfill orders. The management of our inventory is complex, and any mismanagement could adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to maintain high-quality support services is critical for customer satisfaction and retention. We must also ensure compliance with various regulatory requirements, including those related to data privacy and cybersecurity. Our business model relies on the successful integration of our products and services within our customers' environments, which requires effective coordination and communication across our organization. The competitive landscape in the cybersecurity market is dynamic, and we must continuously innovate to maintain our market position. Our strategic resource allocation decisions will significantly impact our ability to achieve long-term growth and operational efficiency.

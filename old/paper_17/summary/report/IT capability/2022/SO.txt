The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, as well as the successful performance of necessary corporate functions. The registrants operate in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of interconnected systems. The registrants face risks associated with operator error, equipment failure, technology system failures, and cyber intrusions, which could impact their ability to operate effectively. The registrants have robust processes for identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related risks, which rely on information from internal and external sources. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality is critical for supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. The registrants must attract, train, and retain a workforce with the necessary management skills and technical capabilities to meet current and future needs. The costs associated with implementing, maintaining, and enhancing system protection measures against cyber risks are significant and could materially increase. The registrants are subject to risks associated with supply chain disruptions and inflation, which could negatively impact operations and the timely recovery of costs. Changes in technology could alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize power, and the registrants must adapt to evolving market dynamics and customer demands for new and varied products and services. The registrants' planning processes must project many years into the future to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction of new generation and associated transmission facilities. The registrants are also exposed to regulatory and financial risks related to the impact of greenhouse gas legislation and emission reduction goals, which could significantly affect their operational strategies and investment decisions. The registrants' ability to recover costs through regulated rates may be influenced by changes in regulatory frameworks, which could affect their financial stability and operational flexibility. The registrants continually seek opportunities to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions and investments in new technologies, which may involve risks and uncertainties. The registrants' operational effectiveness is contingent upon their ability to leverage IT capabilities and resources to enhance business processes and respond to competitive pressures. The registrants face challenges in maintaining reliability consistent with customer expectations as they transition their generating fleets in support of sustainability goals. The registrants must also navigate the complexities of interfirm transactions and relationships, which are essential for coordinating their assets and internal processes. The evolving landscape of digital technologies necessitates that the registrants remain agile and responsive to market changes while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The registrants' strategic resource allocation decisions are critical for sustaining their competitive advantage and achieving long-term business objectives.

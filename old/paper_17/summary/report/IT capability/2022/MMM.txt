The company employs information technology systems to support its business and collect, store, and use proprietary and confidential information, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security and data breaches, cyberattacks, and other cybersecurity incidents involving the company's information technology systems and infrastructure could disrupt or interfere with the company's operations; result in the compromise and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to the company or its customers, suppliers, and employees; and expose the company to numerous expenses, liabilities, and other negative consequences, any or all of which could adversely impact the company's business, reputation, and results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, the company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted, or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of its businesses that is subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Third parties and threat actors, including organized criminals, nation-state, or nation-state supported actors, regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to the company's information technology networks and infrastructure, data, and other information, and many such attempts are increasingly sophisticated. Despite the company's cybersecurity and business continuity measures, the company's information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially susceptible to attack, compromise, damage, disruption, or shutdown, including as a result of the exploitation of known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities in its systems or in the systems of its vendors and third-party service providers. The company's increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the pandemic, also introduces additional threats and risk of disruptions to its information technology networks and infrastructure. Any cybersecurity incident or information technology network disruption could result in numerous negative consequences, including the risk of legal claims or proceedings, investigations or enforcement actions by U.S., state, or foreign regulators; liabilities or penalties under applicable laws and regulations, including privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions; interference with the company's operations; the incurrence of remediation costs; loss of intellectual property protection; the loss of customer, supplier, or employee relationships; and damage to the company's reputation, any of which could adversely affect the company's business. The company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and changes to its organizational structure. The company's financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The company utilizes various tools, such as continuous improvement, to improve productivity and reduce expenses and engages in ongoing global business transformation to improve operational efficiency, productivity, and the speed and efficiency with which it serves customers, enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system.

Sempra's businesses are subject to risks arising from their infrastructure and information systems, which are interconnected and managed through complex technologies. The performance of these systems is critical to meeting customer demand for electricity and natural gas, and any breakdowns could adversely affect operations. The company relies on third parties for various projects and maintenance activities, which introduces additional risks related to safety and quality. Sempra's operational flexibility is influenced by environmental requirements and governmental interventions, which may restrict the ability to maintain or replace long-term contracts. The increasing deployment of digital technologies and demand management technologies necessitates further modernization of the electric distribution grid to accommodate two-way flows of electricity. Sempra's ability to execute its business strategies and generate cash flows depends significantly on the performance of its subsidiaries and their ability to leverage technology resources effectively. The company is also exposed to cybersecurity risks associated with the energy grid and the protection of sensitive customer information, which is increasingly required to be disclosed under state privacy laws. The virtualization of business activities and reliance on third-party vendors for technology deployment heighten these risks. Sempra's investment in technology capabilities is essential for supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency, as well as for achieving strategic resource allocation and competitive advantage. The company actively seeks growth opportunities through acquisitions and partnerships, analyzing the financial viability of each initiative. However, the effectiveness of these investments may be challenged by difficulties in integrating operations and personnel, as well as fluctuations in markets. The potential for impairment of assets, particularly in the context of regulatory changes and environmental compliance, could materially affect Sempra's financial performance. The company's capital investment projects, aimed at upgrading facilities and systems, may not always effectively manage operational risks and could involve significant costs. Sempra's commitment to digital transformation and investment in innovative technologies is crucial for maintaining its competitive positioning in the energy sector, particularly as it navigates the evolving regulatory landscape and market dynamics. The reliance on information systems and the ability to manage data effectively are integral to Sempra's operational success and strategic management practices, impacting overall firm performance and market-based performance.

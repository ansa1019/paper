AEP's operations are highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, which involves risks including information technology failure that impairs AEP's information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations. Information technology failure could affect AEP's ability to access customer information or cause loss of confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects AEP's reputation or exposes AEP to legal claims. AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. The operation of these critical infrastructure assets is dependent on information technology systems, and the computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks, making them targets for cyber-attacks. AEP has been notified by the federal government that the likelihood of a cyber-attack on such systems has increased due to geopolitical tensions. A security breach could severely disrupt business operations, prevent service to customers, or lead to the loss of revenues. AEP's information technology systems are crucial for the collection of sensitive customer data, and a breach could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage, as well as litigation, fines, and damage to AEP's reputation. AEP cannot guarantee that security efforts will detect or prevent breaches or operational incidents and cannot assure that such incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future. The company's ability to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates is contingent upon regulatory approval, and compliance with new reliability standards may subject AEP to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. AEP's management believes that its experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives it an advantage over competitors in securing authorization to install, construct, and operate new transmission lines and facilities. However, there is no assurance that regulatory bodies will authorize new projects or that existing formula rates will not be challenged, which could negatively impact AEP's financial condition. The company's financial performance is linked to its ability to effectively manage its information technology resources, which are integral to operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. AEP's reliance on third-party vendors for technology systems and the potential for unauthorized access to these systems pose ongoing risks to its operational capabilities. The evolving landscape of information technology and regulatory requirements necessitates continuous investment in IT capabilities to support business strategies and enhance operational flexibility. AEP's ability to adapt to changes in technology and regulatory policies is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring compliance with mandatory reliability standards.

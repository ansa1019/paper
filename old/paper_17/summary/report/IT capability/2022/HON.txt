Information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The company employs information technology systems and networks to support the business and relies on them to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to the information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, cybersecurity incidents, and other events could interfere with operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact reputation. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact reputation and results of operations. The company seeks to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate cybersecurity threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, and continuous monitoring of IT networks and systems. The company has developed product software designs that are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but if compromised, the consequences could include financial loss, reputational damage, and increased cybersecurity protection costs. The company's management capability is critical in transforming the firm into a competitive force, and its IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. The company recognizes the need for operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation to respond to market dynamics and competitive actions. The integration of digital technologies into business processes is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and achieving market-based performance. The firm’s IT architecture supports the deployment of technology functionalities that enhance connectivity and facilitate communication across the value chain. The company’s strategic management practices include evaluating investment opportunities and actionable investments that align with business needs and directions. The firm’s ability to manage data effectively is crucial for ensuring information reliability and security, which in turn supports decision-making speed and information accuracy. The company’s focus on innovation partnerships and technology deployment is aimed at enhancing its competitive advantage and market responsiveness. The evolving regulatory context and environmental factors necessitate a robust IT governance framework to manage risks and ensure compliance. The company’s commitment to organizational transformation and capability development is reflected in its investments in digital infrastructure and technology integration, which are vital for sustaining competitive positioning and achieving long-term business resilience.

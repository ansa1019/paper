Our future results of operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and current results, and from our projections. We may not be able to keep pace with changes in technology or provide timely enhancements to our products and services. The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological advancements, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and changing industry standards. To maintain our growth strategy, we must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems, particularly our systems that meet our clients' requirements. If our systems become outdated, it may negatively impact our ability to meet performance expectations related to quality, time to market, cost, and innovation relative to our competitors. The failure to continually develop enhancements and use of technologies such as robotics and other workflow automation tools, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence/machine learning may impact our ability to increase the efficiency of and reduce costs associated with operational risk management and compliance activities. We rely upon information technology ("IT") networks, cloud-based platforms, and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to support a variety of business processes, some of which are provided by third-party vendors. Cyberattacks and security threats are a risk to our business and reputation. A cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption or outage, corruption of data, or theft of personal or other sensitive information could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients. The rapid speed of disruptive innovations involving cyberattacks, security vulnerabilities, and internet disruptions enabled by new and emerging technologies may outpace our organization's ability to compete and/or manage the risk appropriately. Our service platforms enable our clients to store and process personal data on premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment that we host. The security of our IT infrastructure is an important consideration in our customers' purchasing decisions. We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our information security and controls. If our security measures are breached, our business could be substantially harmed, and we could incur significant liabilities. Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from unauthorized security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations. We continue to make significant investments related to the development of new technology. Our ongoing investments in our platforms have prepared us well for the demands of the current business and regulatory environments, allowing us to adapt while maintaining strong service delivery. We believe that investing in our products, people, and service capabilities will position us to capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth. We continue to strengthen our position in the industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients, businesses of all sizes, and other interested parties. Our fiscal 2022 technology and solution developments provide a unique combination of data, technology, and service designed to meet the evolving needs of employers and employees. We believe these investments are critical to our success.

Our business activities are highly dependent on information systems and technology, which include financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. We face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation, or settlement of transactions and reliance on manual processes in certain circumstances. The effectiveness of our technology infrastructure is critical to our ability to process and evaluate transactions across markets and geographies in a time-sensitive, efficient, and accurate manner. We rely on third-party service providers for various services, including technology, administration, and compliance matters, and any failure in their systems could disrupt our operations and result in significant losses. Our operational flexibility and efficiency are influenced by our ability to maintain and upgrade our information technology systems, which must accommodate our growth and protect sensitive information. Cybersecurity is a top priority, as we collect, process, and store proprietary, confidential, and sensitive information. The risk of a security breach or disruption has increased due to the growing sophistication of cyber threats. We may be exposed to significant risks if our systems are compromised, which could lead to reputational damage and regulatory intervention. Additionally, the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding data privacy and cybersecurity requires us to allocate resources to ensure compliance, which may increase operational costs. Our investment strategies are also influenced by technological advancements and innovation, as we seek to leverage digital technologies to enhance our competitive advantage. The ability to effectively manage and deploy technology resources is essential for achieving our business objectives and maintaining market responsiveness. We recognize that our IT capabilities must evolve to support our strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency. The integration of advanced technology functionalities into our business processes is necessary to optimize performance and improve decision-making speed. Our reliance on information systems capability extends to our portfolio companies, which also depend on secure and efficient data management practices. The performance of our investments can be significantly impacted by the effectiveness of their technology management and operational processes. We must continuously evaluate and enhance our technology portfolio to ensure alignment with our organizational goals and to respond to market dynamics effectively. The challenges associated with managing our IT infrastructure and ensuring information reliability are critical to our overall business performance. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer demands is contingent upon our investment in technology and the effective deployment of IT resources. As we expand into new investment strategies and geographic markets, we must remain vigilant in managing the risks associated with our technology capabilities and ensure that our systems are robust enough to support our growth initiatives. The interplay between our IT governance and operational practices is crucial for maintaining organizational effectiveness and achieving long-term value creation.
Global Atlantic relies on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, Global Atlantic and its employees. It is possible that an employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information or Global Atlantic's data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack. Global Atlantic's third-party administrators and their employees also have access to, and routinely process, personal information of clients, and Global Atlantic is dependent on such third parties and their systems to protect such data. Global Atlantic analyzes customer data to better manage its business. There has been increased scrutiny, including from regulators, regarding the use of "big data," diligence of data sets, and oversight of data vendors. Global Atlantic's ability to use data to gain insights into and manage its business may be limited in the future by regulatory scrutiny. Regulators are also increasing scrutiny and considering regulation of the use of artificial intelligence technologies. Changes in accounting standards could adversely impact Global Atlantic's reported results of operations and reported financial condition. Global Atlantic's financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised, reinterpreted, and/or expanded. The new guidance will have a significant impact on Global Atlantic's systems, processes, and controls. Global Atlantic helps to set, and monitor compliance with, the investment guidelines followed by the applicable ceding company. However, to the extent that such investment guidelines are not appropriate, or to the extent that the ceding companies do not adhere to such guidelines, Global Atlantic's risk of loss could increase, which could materially adversely affect its GAAP results, financial condition, and results of operations. Global Atlantic's operating subsidiaries manage their liabilities and configure their investment portfolios to provide and maintain sufficient liquidity to support anticipated withdrawal demands, surrenders, contract benefits, and maturities. While Global Atlantic's operating subsidiaries own a significant amount of liquid assets, a portion of their assets are considered less liquid. Unanticipated withdrawal or surrender activity or liquidity demands in connection with recaptures or collateralization requirements could, under some circumstances, require Global Atlantic's operating subsidiaries to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on Global Atlantic's business, results of operations, and financial condition. The SEC recently stated that it intends to apply rule 15c2-11 to fixed income markets. The requirements of the rule could restrict the ability of market participants to publish quotations for applicable fixed income securities after January 4, 2025. This change could have a material and adverse impact on Global Atlantic's privately placed fixed maturity securities as well as on Global Atlantic's investments or ability to invest in privately placed fixed maturity securities. Global Atlantic's investment of assets held in trust is restricted based on the terms of the trust agreement and associated investment guidelines. As such, Global Atlantic may not have flexibility to invest such assets as it otherwise might, and Global Atlantic's investment returns on such assets may therefore be less than if they were not held in trust. Global Atlantic's bermuda insurance subsidiaries are licensed to conduct insurance business by the BMA. In 2016, the BMA made significant changes to Bermuda's regulatory and supervisory regimes to achieve equivalence with the EU's directive 2009/138EC, as amended (Solvency II). The BMA implemented the economic balance sheet framework, which is now used as the basis to determine an insurer's enhanced capital requirement. Changes to GAAP, SAP, the Bermuda EBS framework, or capital models may be complex, require significant resources to implement, and have an impact on Global Atlantic's controls, which may be significant.

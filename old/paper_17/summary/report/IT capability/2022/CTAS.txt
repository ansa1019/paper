Cintas relies extensively on computer systems, including third-party systems, to process transactions, maintain information, and manage its businesses. Disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to the implementation of a new system or otherwise, or privacy breaches involving computer systems, could impact the ability to service customers and adversely affect sales, consolidated results of operations, and reputation, exposing the company to litigation risk. The company has an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested; however, its computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to power outages, computer or telecommunication failures, catastrophic events, and usage errors by employees. Although appropriate measures have been adopted to mitigate potential risks to technology and operations from these disruptions, the unpredictability of such events could lead to production downtimes, operational delays, and interruptions in the ability to provide products and services to customers. Any disruption caused by the unavailability of computer systems could adversely affect sales and may require significant investment to rectify, thereby impacting consolidated results of operations. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include malicious software, unauthorized access attempts, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential information, and corruption of data. The company has experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, but none have had a material adverse effect on business or results of operations. If the network of security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, and monitoring systems to address these threats fails, it could result in financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability and damage to reputation. Cintas also relies on software applications, enterprise cloud storage systems, and cloud computing services provided by third-party vendors for certain IT services, including its SAP enterprise system, payroll data, risk management data, and lease data. If these third-party vendors experience service interruptions, security breaches, or cyber-attacks, the business and consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected. The company’s ability to achieve and maintain effective internal controls is necessary for providing reliable financial reports. All internal control systems, regardless of design, have inherent limitations, and even those deemed effective can only provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements. Failure to maintain the adequacy of internal controls or discover material weaknesses could hinder the ability to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, adversely affecting investor confidence and stock price. The company’s operations are also impacted by the need to comply with complex and stringent state and federal regulations, including those related to employment, health and safety, and environmental laws. Compliance with new laws and regulations may increase operating costs or require significant capital expenditures, which could adversely affect the ability to service customers and consolidated results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created widespread disruption in the global economy, impacting the company’s ability to conduct normal business operations and affecting the financial performance of customers and suppliers. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and its long-term effects on the economy and customer operations remains a significant concern.

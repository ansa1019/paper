Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including risks related to our global operations and business dynamics. As a global company, we are subject to social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries, which may affect our ability to coordinate our assets and internal processes effectively. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the U.S., and our revenues from international operations may be impacted by local business cycles and economic instability. The ability to establish effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies is crucial for compliance with applicable regulations, which may also influence our IT capabilities and governance. Disruptions in global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting our IT investment decisions and operational flexibility. Our operating performance is further impacted by economic conditions in specific markets where we own properties, which may affect our business processes and strategic resource allocation. We are exposed to risks associated with technological changes, such as reconfiguration of supply chains and the integration of digital technologies, which may influence our operational efficiency and business innovation. Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the logistics sector, and economic downturns in this sector could adversely affect our firm performance and market-based performance. We may experience challenges in integrating operations of newly acquired companies and realizing anticipated synergies, which could hinder our IT architecture and management capabilities. Our real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful, and we may face difficulties in obtaining financing for development projects, which could impact our operational effectiveness and resource management. We are also subject to risks related to our dependence on key personnel, whose expertise is essential for leveraging our IT capabilities and maintaining competitive advantage. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors or misstatements, which could result in misstatements of our financial statements and affect our organizational performance. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks, which may disrupt our operations and lead to significant legal and financial exposure. We have formed co-investment ventures that involve risks, including the potential inability to realize value from our existing or future investments, which may affect our strategic management practices and capability development. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms is influenced by general market conditions and the market's perception of our growth potential, which is critical for our IT investment and operational strategies. The potential impacts of future climate change could also require us to implement new regulations that may affect our business and financial condition, highlighting the importance of strategic alignment and organizational transformation in our operations.

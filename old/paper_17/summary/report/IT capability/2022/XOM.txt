ExxonMobil's ability to maintain and grow its oil and gas production depends on the success of its exploration and development efforts, which require continuous improvement in identifying promising resource prospects and applying project management expertise. The long-term success of ExxonMobil's upstream and product solutions businesses, as well as its lower-emission investments, relies on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects that necessitate a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. This includes negotiating successfully with joint venturers, partners, and suppliers, as well as managing changes in operating conditions and costs. Operational efficiency is a critical component of ExxonMobil's competitive performance, which includes managing expenses and improving production yields through technology improvements and productivity enhancements. The company's technology, research, and development organizations must adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ExxonMobil must continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in the ability to process large amounts of data to its businesses. The company is regularly subject to cybersecurity disruptions and has implemented multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection, alongside non-technological measures such as threat information sharing and employee training. The effectiveness of its management systems and controls is crucial to minimize risks associated with oil, gas, and petrochemical operations. The success of ExxonMobil's strategy for the energy transition will depend on its ability to recognize key signposts of change in the global energy system and direct investment to technologies and businesses at the appropriate stage of development. The company's efforts include in-house research and development as well as collaborative efforts with universities and commercial partners involved in advanced lower-emission energy technologies. The scale of the world's energy system necessitates appropriate support from governments and private participants for a successful energy transition, which will also depend on the development of supportive government policies and markets. The company's ability to develop and deploy carbon capture and storage and other lower-emission energy technologies at commercial scale will significantly influence its future returns and the growth of its lower-carbon solutions business. Additionally, ExxonMobil's reputation is an important corporate asset that could be negatively impacted by operating incidents, cybersecurity disruptions, or perceptions regarding its progress in the energy transition. The company's competitive positioning is also affected by technological improvements in energy efficiency and changes in consumer preferences, which may alter fuel choices and impact demand for its products.

The company relies on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data. These systems manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities, such as receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, and fulfilling contractual obligations. The company's information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, and other cyber-attacks, which are expected to increase in sophistication and frequency. Any attacks, breaches, or disruptions could interrupt operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property, damage customer relationships, and increase costs for security and remediation. The company maintains cyber risk insurance; however, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the available insurance. The company’s growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions, which are dependent on identifying acceptable candidates, successfully integrating acquired businesses, and managing increased operational complexity.

The company’s operational excellence initiatives are designed to enhance efficiency in a highly competitive environment, with the success of these initiatives linked to the proper execution and realization of anticipated cost savings. The company’s ability to hire, develop, and retain a skilled workforce is critical for effective integration of acquired businesses and for managing expanding international operations. The company's financial performance could be adversely affected by disruptions in its information technology systems, which are integral to its operational capabilities. The company continues to assess the financial impact of external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain constraints, which may affect its ability to operate effectively and meet customer obligations. The company's strategic initiatives, including operational excellence and investment in technology, are aimed at enhancing its competitive position and supporting business transformation. The company’s ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer demands is essential for maintaining its market value and achieving performance excellence. The ongoing evaluation of its information management capabilities underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging other organizational capabilities to support business strategies and enhance operational efficiency.

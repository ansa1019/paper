In evaluating NVIDIA, the company recognizes that failure to meet the evolving needs of the industry and markets may adversely impact financial results. The accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive products, and industry standards. Success depends on timely identification of industry changes, adapting strategies, and developing new or enhanced products and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. This includes managing product and software lifecycles to maintain customer satisfaction and developing the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale the business. The company invests in research and development in markets with limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years. The ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers demand is critical for obtaining design wins, which do not guarantee revenue. The competitive landscape is characterized by rapid changes in product offerings, industry standards, and customer needs, which may cause NVIDIA to lose market share and revenue. Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology reduces control over product quantity and quality, which could harm the business. Modifications or interruptions of business processes and information systems may disrupt operations, processes, and internal controls. The company relies on internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, and any issues with these systems could adversely affect operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has created supply chain and logistics constraints, and the company has modified business practices in response to the pandemic. The company also faces risks associated with cybersecurity, including data breaches and cyber-attacks that could disrupt operations and adversely affect financial condition and reputation. The management of new regulatory requirements, particularly regarding data privacy and security, is complicated and time-consuming, and non-compliance could result in significant penalties. The company is subject to stringent and changing data privacy laws, and concerns regarding the responsible use of technologies, including AI, may result in reputational and financial harm. The ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees is critical for executing business strategy successfully. The company’s operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so, influenced by various factors, including the ability to comply with contractual obligations and changes in economic conditions. The management of supply chain risks, including reliance on third-party suppliers and the need for accurate demand forecasting, is essential to avoid mismatches between supply and demand. The company’s financial performance may also be impacted by increased scrutiny regarding environmental, social, and governance responsibilities, which could result in additional costs or risks. Overall, the evolving landscape of technology and market dynamics necessitates a robust IT capability to support business strategies, enhance operational efficiency, and maintain competitive advantage.

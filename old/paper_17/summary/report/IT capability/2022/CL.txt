We rely extensively on information technology systems ("IT systems"), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to: communicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; receiving and processing orders from, shipping products to and invoicing our customers and consumers; marketing products to consumers; collecting, storing, transferring and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers and vendors; hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, intellectual property, business plans and financial information; summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; complying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes involved in managing our business. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property, including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and trade dress rights, against infringement and legal challenges by competitors. We face significant competition in our industry, including from strong local competitors and from other large, multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our success is increasingly dependent on our ability to effectively leverage digital technology and data analytics to gain new commercial insights and develop relevant marketing and advertising to reach customers and consumers. We continue to invest behind our digital and analytics capabilities and higher growth businesses. The substantial growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. Our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and long-term profitable growth through science-led, core and premium innovation; pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments; expanding in faster growing channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to maximize the impact of our environmental, social and governance programs and leading in the development of human capital, including our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. We continue to strengthen and leverage our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, ecommerce and data and analytics, enabling us to be more responsive in today's rapidly changing world. Our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to profitability and driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges we face and increase shareholder value over time. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers', IT systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. If we suffer a significant loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our IT systems, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

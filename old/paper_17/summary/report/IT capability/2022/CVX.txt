Chevron's operations are subject to numerous risks, including those related to cybersecurity and the integrity of its information technology (IT) systems. Cyberattacks targeting Chevron's process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations. The company faces evolving risks to its cybersecurity from various threat actors, including criminal hackers and state-sponsored intrusions, which are becoming more sophisticated in their attempts to access the company's IT systems and data. Despite significant resources devoted to preventing intrusions and protecting its systems, Chevron has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents that could disrupt business operations, harm the environment, and result in the loss or corruption of critical data and proprietary information. The reliance on third-party IT systems, including cloud services, further exposes the company to potential cyber incidents that could materially impact its operations. Additionally, the company's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets, emphasizing the importance of effectively managing operational risks through the integration of IT capabilities. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in conjunction with other organizational capabilities is crucial for Chevron to maintain operational efficiency and achieve its business objectives. The company's management practices incorporate potential ranges of risks, including those associated with technology deployment and operational flexibility, which are essential for responding to market dynamics and maintaining competitive advantage. Furthermore, the integration of IT capabilities into business processes is vital for enhancing organizational performance and ensuring the reliability and security of information management. The company's strategic resource allocation decisions are influenced by the need to invest in IT capabilities that support business transformation and innovation. As such, the effective coordination of IT resources with other organizational assets is critical for Chevron to navigate the complexities of the energy sector and respond to external influences, including regulatory changes and market demands. The evolving landscape of digital technologies necessitates a focus on maintaining robust IT governance and ensuring that the company's technology infrastructure aligns with its strategic goals. The interplay between IT capabilities and business processes underscores the importance of leveraging technology to optimize performance, enhance decision-making speed, and improve overall operational effectiveness.

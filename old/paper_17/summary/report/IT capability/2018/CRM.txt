The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer's data, our data, or our IT systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure, leading to reputational harm and legal exposure. Our services involve the storage and transmission of sensitive data, including financial information and personally identifiable information. While we have security measures in place, our services and underlying infrastructure may be materially breached or compromised due to various vulnerabilities, including third-party attempts to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information, cyber-attacks, and employee errors. These risks are mitigated by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes, and internal security controls. Our board of directors and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices. However, we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security. Our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the complexity of our IT systems, which evolve as we adopt new technologies and ways of sharing data. Additionally, our limited control over third-party technology providers may hinder our ability to maintain the integrity or security of data processing. We have experienced interruptions in our services, which may occur in the future, and these interruptions could harm our business. Our reliance on third-party systems increases our exposure to service interruptions. We utilize disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, but these facilities may be vulnerable to various risks, including natural disasters and administrative actions. Privacy concerns and evolving regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services, impacting our business. Compliance with new laws may require us to make changes to our services and increase our potential liability exposure. Our efforts to expand our services beyond the CRM market may not succeed, and our revenue growth could be adversely affected. The markets for our offerings are highly competitive and require continuous innovation. We may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors, which could negatively impact our sales. Our ability to deliver services depends on the infrastructure of the internet, which is managed by independent third-party organizations. Outages and delays in this infrastructure could reduce the availability of our services. We are also subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including the potential loss of invested capital. Our ability to meet expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which is affected by various factors. We expect to continue investing in our infrastructure to scale operations and enhance security measures. Our operations may be impacted by economic conditions, regulatory changes, and geopolitical developments. We may face challenges in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, which could harm our business. Our success depends on maintaining high-quality technical support services, and any failure in this area could adversely affect our relationships with customers. Our brand strength relies on our ability to remain a technology leader and provide innovative products and services. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impair our ability to protect our technology and brand.

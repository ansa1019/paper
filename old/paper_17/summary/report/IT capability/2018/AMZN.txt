We face intense competition as our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, including e-commerce and omnichannel retail. Some of our current and potential competitors may devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, and marketing. Our expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business and competitive risks, including new and difficult technology challenges. Our ability to manage growth effectively could impact our reputation and operating results. We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate, which depend on the continued growth of demand for our products and services. Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our sales and operating results will fluctuate due to various factors, including our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy customer demands. The timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure are critical to our operational flexibility and performance. Our international operations expose us to risks, including local economic and political conditions, government regulation, and compliance with laws regarding consumer and data protection. The complexity of our fulfillment network and data centers increases as we add capability and new businesses, which may challenge our operational effectiveness. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies, and our ability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies is essential for maintaining operational efficiency. Our technology and content investments support a variety of product and service offerings, and we expect spending in these areas to increase over time. We seek to invest efficiently in technology infrastructure to enhance customer experience and improve process efficiencies. Our technology capabilities are critical for managing our operations and supporting our business strategies. We face risks related to system interruptions and lack of redundancy, which could adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, we depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly in technology roles, to maintain our competitive advantage. Our reliance on third-party technology and systems for various functions exposes us to risks related to data loss and security breaches. We continuously evaluate opportunities to optimize our fulfillment network and data centers, as failure to do so could harm our business. Our technology infrastructure must support our growing operational demands, and we recognize that effective management of our technology resources is essential for achieving our organizational goals. The integration of acquired operations and technology into our existing systems poses additional challenges that could impact our performance. Our investments in technology and content are designed to enhance our capabilities and support our long-term growth objectives, while also addressing the dynamic nature of the market and competitive landscape.

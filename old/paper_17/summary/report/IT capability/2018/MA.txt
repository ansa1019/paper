The global payments industry is highly competitive, with substantial and intense competition that may materially and adversely affect overall business and results of operations. Our payment programs compete against various forms of payment, including electronic, mobile, and e-commerce payment platforms, which can impact our market positioning and operational flexibility. The ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors and drive value for customers is critical, as competitors may introduce innovative programs and services that adversely affect our growth. We face risks of disintermediation, where parties that process transactions may attempt to eliminate our intermediary role, impacting our operational efficiency and market response. Furthermore, regulatory changes could impose additional compliance burdens, affecting our ability to innovate and offer differentiated products and services. The payments industry is subject to rapid technological changes, including developments in smart cards, contactless payments, and blockchain technology, which could render existing technologies obsolete and require significant investment in IT capabilities. Our acquisition of Vocalink has added real-time account-based payment technology, presenting both business opportunities and regulatory risks associated with administering such a network. We rely on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network, and any failure in these services could disrupt our operations. Information security incidents or account data compromises pose significant risks, as they could disrupt business, damage reputation, and increase operational costs. The complexity of our technology infrastructure requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities, and our operations depend on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information. We are subject to increasingly complex regulations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, which could amplify operational costs and impact our growth. Our ability to attract and retain technology experts is essential for developing and adopting new services and technologies, and failure to keep pace with technological developments could lead to a decline in the use of our products. The reliance on technology companies to enhance payment safety and security is critical, and our inability to adapt to technological changes may negatively impact our relationships with these partners. Additionally, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers, as well as their ability to effectively manage relationships with account holders and merchants. Our strategic initiatives require substantial resources, and the successful integration of acquisitions is vital for enhancing our technology capabilities. The evolving nature of regulatory scrutiny and compliance requirements necessitates ongoing investment in IT governance and management practices to ensure operational effectiveness and alignment with business strategies.

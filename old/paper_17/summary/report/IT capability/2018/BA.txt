Our commercial airplanes and global services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, which are subject to unique risks influenced by technological advances and competitive factors. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic, where demand is affected by airline profitability, technological advances, and other competitive factors. The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and certification schedules, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our ability to deliver aircraft on time and satisfy regulatory and customer requirements is subject to significant risks, including operational challenges impacting the production system. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Our commercial airplanes business relies on maintaining a healthy production system and achieving planned production rate targets, which requires extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and partners. The complexity of our production system necessitates effective management of information technology systems to ensure operational efficiency and support business needs. We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data and systems, which could negatively impact our business and customer relationships. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses, supplemented by Boeing Capital, which facilitates selective financing solutions for our customers. The commercial jet airplane market remains extremely competitive, with increasing pressures on pricing and the need for major productivity gains to ensure a favorable market position. Our focus on improving products and services, along with cost-reduction efforts, enhances our ability to compete effectively in this dynamic environment. We also rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers, and subcontractors, which is crucial for our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. Our business is impacted by disruptions, including threats to information technology or cyber-attacks, which could affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. The ongoing uncertainty with respect to U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment emphasizes the need for cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives in our procurement processes. The integration of technology capabilities across our business segments is essential for capturing key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets. We continue to seek opportunities to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency, which are critical for maintaining our competitive advantage in the global market.

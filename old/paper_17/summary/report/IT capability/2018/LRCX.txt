The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand, leading to variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry. Variability in customers' business plans may lead to changes in demand for equipment and services, impacting results. Management must adjust spending and resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand. Challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training and managing the workforce may arise. The ability to identify and respond to these challenges effectively is crucial for future performance. The economic, political, and business conditions occurring nationally and globally have historically impacted customer demand for products and commercial relationships. Changing business or economic conditions can cause material adverse changes to results of operations and financial condition, including declines in demand, increases in reserves on accounts receivable, and challenges maintaining reliable sources of supply. Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect aggregate shipments, revenues, operating results, and earnings. The company must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm profitability. The company is subject to risks associated with rapid technological change, which requires the development of new products with improved capabilities and the enhancement of existing products. Failure to develop and manufacture products successfully could adversely affect business performance. Investments in research and development are expected to continue, focusing on leading-edge technologies to meet customer requirements. The company’s success depends on its ability to develop and offer new products and processes, as well as enhance existing products. Additionally, the company faces risks relating to product concentration and lack of revenue diversification, as a substantial percentage of revenues derive from a limited number of products. Strategic alliances and customer consolidation may negatively affect business, as semiconductor manufacturing companies increasingly enter into alliances to expedite development and achieve economies of scale. The company depends on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers for manufacturing operations and information technology resources. Disruptions to these providers may impair the ability to manage operations and generate revenues. The company must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect sales of existing products. The company maintains critical information systems for effective operations, which are susceptible to cybersecurity threats. Past incidents have not resulted in material adverse effects, but future cyber incidents could have significant impacts on business operations. The company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to its success, and ongoing challenges exist due to competition for talent and fluctuations in economic conditions. The management strategy includes reviewing acquisition prospects to enhance technological capabilities, which entails operational and financial risks. The company’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various risks, including regulatory changes, compliance costs, and potential liabilities.

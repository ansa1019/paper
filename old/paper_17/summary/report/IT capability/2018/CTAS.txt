Cintas relies extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information, and manage its businesses. Disruptions in the availability of computer systems due to implementation of a new system or otherwise, or privacy breaches involving computer systems, could impact the ability to service customers and adversely affect sales, results of operations, and reputation. The company has an active disaster recovery plan that is frequently reviewed and tested. However, computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions, power outages, computer or telecommunication failures, catastrophic events, and usage errors by employees. Although appropriate measures have been adopted to mitigate potential risks to technology and operations, disruptions could lead to production downtimes, operational delays, and interruptions in the ability to provide products and services. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential information, and corruption of data. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect business and stock price. Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports, and all internal control systems have inherent limitations. If management fails to maintain the adequacy of internal controls or if material weaknesses are discovered, it may not be able to ensure effective control over financial reporting, which could result in a loss of investor confidence and adversely affect stock price. The company’s ability to attract and retain competent personnel in key positions is critical to its success, and competitive pressures may make it more difficult and expensive to attract and retain key employees. Cintas evaluates opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement internal growth, and the success of any acquisition depends in part on the ability to integrate the acquired company. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and require significant management attention and resources. If management is unable to effectively manage the integration process or if significant business activities are interrupted, the company may not realize anticipated cost synergies, which could adversely affect business. Cintas has incurred transaction and integration expenses related to acquisitions, including costs associated with the implementation of its SAP system. The company continues to evaluate its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information regularly reviewed by its chief operating decision maker for resource allocation and performance assessment. The integration of new technologies and systems is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and supporting business needs. The company’s strategic management practices emphasize the importance of leveraging IT capabilities to enhance business performance, operational flexibility, and market responsiveness. The reliance on technology resources and the ability to manage information effectively are critical for achieving competitive advantage and maximizing long-term value for shareholders.

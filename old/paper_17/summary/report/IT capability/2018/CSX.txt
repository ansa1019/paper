The company relies on the security, stability, and availability of its technology systems to operate its business. The performance and reliability of the company's technology systems are critical to its ability to operate and compete safely and effectively. A cybersecurity attack, which is a deliberate theft of data or impairment of information technology systems, or other significant disruption or failure, could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential information, process failure, security breach, or other operational difficulties. Such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital, insurance, or operating costs, including increased security costs to protect the company's infrastructure. The company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability, and other factors from various transportation providers, including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area. Future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, such as through the use of automation, autonomy, or electrification, could negatively impact the company's competitive position. The company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long-term, profitable growth through optimizing network and terminal capacity. The operational plan remains focused on delivering further service gains, improving transit times, and driving asset utilization while controlling costs. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The company’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The company is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect its ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. The company expects to continue incurring capital costs in connection with the implementation of positive train control (PTC), which is a significant investment in technology infrastructure. The total multi-year cost of PTC implementation is estimated at approximately $2.4 billion, which includes costs for installing the new system along tracks, upgrading locomotives, adding communication equipment, and developing new technologies. The company also faces challenges related to regulatory compliance, which could increase operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. The reliance on information technology in all aspects of its business underscores the need for effective IT governance and management practices to support operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. The company’s ability to adapt to changing business needs and directions through its IT capabilities is essential for maintaining a competitive advantage and ensuring business resilience in a dynamic environment.

We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, including the impact of global economic and political conditions on our industries, business, and financial results. Our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic conditions, which can affect customer demand for technology purchases. Rapid technological changes and shifts in customer requirements characterize the software industry, necessitating constant evaluation of our business model and strategy. We are focused on providing solutions that enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative, devoting significant resources to the development of new technologies and frequently introducing new business models that require considerable investment of technical and financial resources. Our strategy to develop and introduce new products exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance and costs related to product defects. A critical component of our growth strategy is to expand customer portfolios to include our other offerings and cloud-based functionality, which requires effective management of our IT capabilities. Our executive management team must act quickly and with vision to meet rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements. We regularly acquire or invest in businesses and technologies complementary to our operations, which involves risks such as the difficulty of assimilating solutions and operations, and the potential for incompatible business cultures. We are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to digitize our operations and support our customers. Our reliance on network and data center infrastructure, technology systems, and websites for various operational activities underscores the importance of IT capability in our business transformation efforts. We continually invest resources to enhance these systems to meet evolving business and customer requirements, particularly as we transition to cloud-based products and a subscription-only business model. The complexity and costs associated with these improvements can lead to operational disruptions if not managed effectively. Our dependency on international revenue exposes us to significant regulatory and economic risks that could adversely impact our financial results. We are also subject to increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws that may impact our business or expose us to increased liability. Security incidents may compromise the integrity of our offerings and customer data, which could harm our reputation and financial performance. We rely on third parties for operational and technical services, and any security incidents involving these third parties could expose us to liability. Our business strategy includes maintaining an open-architecture design of our software products to facilitate third-party development, which enhances our technology capabilities and competitive advantage. We believe that customer adoption of our cloud offerings will continue to grow as industries leverage scalable computing power and flexibility. Our ability to effectively distribute our solutions depends on the financial condition of our distributor and reseller network, which is critical for our revenue generation. Overall, our IT capabilities are integral to our strategic management practices, enabling us to respond to market dynamics and customer needs while enhancing our organizational effectiveness and performance outcomes.

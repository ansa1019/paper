Our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers' planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, and our customers' profitability, which are influenced by general economic and geopolitical conditions. The airline industry has historically been affected by downturns in the global economy and other factors, impacting demand for spare parts and consequently our products. We rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales, and a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers could adversely affect our net sales and financial condition. Our business strategy includes a selective acquisition strategy, which has historically resulted in improvements in the financial performance of acquired businesses. We focus on obtaining profitable new business, improving our cost structure, and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers, which has enabled us to price our products to reflect the value provided. The integration of acquisitions into our existing businesses contributes to operational efficiency and enhances our market-based performance. We are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure, which is essential for operational flexibility and competitive advantage. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to various factors, including economic conditions, competitive dynamics, and regulatory environments. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business. Our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities, which are subject to risks that could disrupt production, including cyber-attacks and equipment malfunctions. We have experienced data security incidents that could lead to operational disruptions, impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Our business is also affected by the price and availability of raw materials and components, which could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers. The aerospace industry is highly regulated, and compliance with government regulations is critical to our operations. We are subject to unique risks associated with supplying equipment and services to the U.S. government, and failure to comply with government contracting requirements could result in penalties that adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is influenced by various external factors. We continually evaluate our debt facilities to ensure they meet our operational needs and strategic objectives. Our future leverage will also be impacted by the conditions of the credit markets. The successful integration of new businesses requires substantial management attention and may affect our ability to pursue other acquisition opportunities. We believe our cash from operations and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic investments and pay dividends to our shareholders. The company expects its capital expenditures to be consistent with our core value-driven operating strategies, which include obtaining profitable new business and providing highly engineered value-added products to customers.

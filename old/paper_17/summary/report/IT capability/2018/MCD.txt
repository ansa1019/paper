The company is increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other platforms, which support McDonald's digital and delivery solutions, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally and with affiliated entities, customers, and independent third parties. Any failure of these systems could significantly impact operations and customer experience. The company continues to build upon its investments in the Experience of the Future (EOTF), focusing on restaurant modernization and technology to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance brand perception. EOTF introduces a new hospitality experience and has proven to be critical drivers of customer satisfaction. The modernization efforts are designed to provide a better customer experience, leading to increased frequency of customer visits along with higher average checks. The company has deployed digital platforms to improve convenience for customers and provide a simpler and more personalized experience, which includes self-order kiosks and mobile ordering. The popularity and utilization of self-order kiosks continue to grow, and in several markets, a significant portion of in-restaurant orders are placed through kiosks. The company is also enhancing its delivery platform, which has expanded significantly and is now available in over half of the global system, with positive customer responses reflected in high satisfaction ratings and increased average checks. The velocity growth plan is a global strategy tailored at a market level to enhance customer experience and convenience. The company recognizes that its success in advancing its strategy will be demonstrated as customers continue to feel good about visiting McDonald's restaurants. The company’s ability to retain, regain, and convert customers depends significantly on its capacity to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and preferences, which are facilitated by its IT capabilities. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support business needs. The effectiveness of the company’s strategies is contingent upon its ability to innovate and differentiate the customer experience, which is increasingly supported by technology. The company’s reliance on third-party systems presents operational, security, and credit risks, and any failure of these systems could lead to significant operational interruptions. The company is committed to enhancing its digital initiatives to engage customers and grow awareness and adoption of digital offerings. The ongoing relevance of the brand is tied to the successful execution of sustainability initiatives, which require systemwide coordination and alignment, further underscoring the strategic integration of technology in achieving organizational goals. The company’s investments in technology are aimed at transforming the customer experience and enhancing operational efficiency, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage in a highly dynamic market environment.

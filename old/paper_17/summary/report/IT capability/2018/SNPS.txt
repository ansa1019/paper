The growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries, with a substantial portion of our revenue reliant on the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. The increasing complexity of designs and concerns about managing costs could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity, impacting demand for our products and services. We work closely with major foundries to ensure that our electronic design automation (EDA), intellectual property (IP), and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their processes. If we fail to optimize our EDA and IP solutions for use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or major IP providers' products, our solutions may become less desirable to customers, adversely affecting our business and financial condition. Our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenue increases our vulnerability to reduced spending or loss of these customers. The semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems, and consolidation among our customers may lead to fewer customers or increased bargaining power, which could negatively impact our operating results. We face competition from other EDA vendors and internal design tools developed by our customers, necessitating continuous innovation and the introduction of new products and services. Our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles, innovate rapidly, and enhance the value of our offerings is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. The global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations, including the need to manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection. Cybersecurity threats could compromise sensitive information and harm our reputation, particularly regarding our security testing solutions. We store sensitive data in our data centers and networks, and despite security measures, our information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks. Our success depends on protecting our proprietary technology and effectively managing our intellectual property rights. Our growth strategy includes substantial investments in developing new products and enhancements through acquisitions and research and development efforts. We must successfully carry out these initiatives to avoid losing our competitive position. Our financial results are affected by fluctuations in demand for our products, competition, and our ability to innovate. We recognize revenue from software licenses and services at varying times, which can lead to variability in our total revenue. The timing of revenue recognition is influenced by customer orders, the complexity of arrangements, and the nature of our business model. We are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations, which increase compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance. Our investment portfolio may be impaired by deterioration in capital markets, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our financial results. We rely on a global network of infrastructure applications and technology systems for our operations, and disruptions in these systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations.

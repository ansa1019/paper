ExxonMobil's financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses, including technological improvements in energy efficiency and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices. The company must continuously improve its ability to identify the most promising resource prospects and apply project management expertise to bring discovered resources online as scheduled and within budget. The long-term success of ExxonMobil's upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects that require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. This includes negotiating successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, and customers, as well as managing changes in operating conditions and costs. The ability to operate efficiently is an important component of ExxonMobil's competitive performance, requiring continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost control, and productivity enhancements. Research and development organizations must adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ExxonMobil's success depends on its ability to manage operational efficiency, including the recruitment, development, and retention of high-caliber employees. The company is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions, necessitating multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection. If measures to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove insufficient, it could adversely affect ExxonMobil's operations and those of its customers, employees, or third parties. The company is conducting research both in-house and in collaboration with leading universities to develop new technologies, including algae-based biofuels and carbon capture and storage. The effectiveness of facility engineering and rigorous disaster preparedness and response planning are crucial for mitigating adverse impacts from severe weather events and other disruptions. ExxonMobil's operations may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage, or cybersecurity attacks, which could require greater costs for security or lead to operational shutdowns. The management's ability to minimize risks inherent in oil, gas, and petrochemical operations is critical, as is the implementation of cost-effective new technologies and operating practices to reduce emissions. The company's reputation is an important corporate asset, and adverse events may negatively impact its ability to compete for new opportunities or obtain necessary regulatory approvals. The competitive landscape includes not only private firms but also state-owned companies that may pursue opportunities with less focus on financial returns. The ability to manage these factors effectively will impact ExxonMobil's performance relative to competition and its overall business strategy alignment.

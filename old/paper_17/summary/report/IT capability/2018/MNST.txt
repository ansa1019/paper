The company must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade its information technology systems, including protecting against internal and external cybersecurity threats. Information technology enables efficient operations, customer interface, financial accuracy, and the production of financial statements. If the company does not effectively manage resources necessary for building and sustaining the proper technology infrastructure, it could face transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, customer loss, business disruptions, and potential loss or damage to intellectual property through security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include malicious software, unauthorized access attempts, and other electronic security breaches that could disrupt business systems, impede customer order processing, and lead to unauthorized release of confidential information. The company has adopted measures, including ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments, to mitigate potential risks to its technology and operations from these disruptions. However, the unpredictability of such disruptions could subject the company to operational interruptions, brand image damage, and private data exposure. Furthermore, if data management systems, including the SAP enterprise resource planning system, do not effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data, the company's ability to plan, forecast, execute business plans, and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, potentially materially affecting its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the timeliness of reporting internal and external operating results. The company recognizes that its IT capability is integral to transforming into a competitive force, as it encompasses the coordination of assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability represents the application of physical and intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills, to further organizational goals. The company’s focus on information management capability emphasizes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored to changing business needs and directions. The management of IT resources is critical to achieving operational efficiency and effectiveness, and to supporting strategic resource allocation and decision-making processes. The company’s ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively is essential for maintaining competitive advantage, enhancing organizational capabilities, and ensuring responsiveness to market dynamics and consumer demands. Additionally, the company faces challenges related to maintaining effective IT governance and managing the risks associated with rapid technological changes and evolving market conditions. The integration of IT systems with business processes is vital for optimizing performance and achieving strategic alignment across the organization, thereby contributing to overall business resilience and performance excellence.

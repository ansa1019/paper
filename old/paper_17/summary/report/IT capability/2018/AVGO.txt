Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to our dependence on a small number of end customers, which increases our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by these significant customers. The terms under which we do business with most of our customers generally do not include commitments to purchase specific quantities, leading to potential revenue shortfalls. We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that relies on third-party contract manufacturers, and any substantial disruption in their supply of wafers or manufacturing services could materially harm our business and customer relationships. We depend on our contract manufacturers to develop new, advanced manufacturing processes and if these processes are not timely developed, we may be unable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency, resulting in lost revenue opportunities. Our growth strategy includes the acquisition of businesses that enhance our technological capabilities, and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of such transactions. The integration of acquired businesses involves significant challenges, including the need to consolidate and integrate corporate, information technology, and administrative infrastructures. We utilize various IT systems and depend on third-party vendors for critical corporate infrastructure services, and any failure of these systems could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our ability to manage our supply chain and fulfill customer orders. Our gross margin is dependent on various factors, including product mix and pricing pressures, and we anticipate further price erosion and lower revenue due to increased competition and the existence of product alternatives. We have made significant investments in research and development to enhance existing technologies and develop new products, and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business. Our ability to generate cash flow is subject to economic, financial, and competitive factors, and any failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to meet customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. We face risks associated with our distributors, including product inventory levels and product sell-through, which could harm our revenue. Our business is also subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may incur significant expenses. Data privacy regulations are expanding, and compliance with these regulations may require substantial investment. Our overall cash tax costs are affected by various factors, including changes in tax regulations and policies, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. We are subject to various legal proceedings that could divert management's attention and result in significant expenses. The complexity of our products may result in unforeseen delays or expenses, which could adversely affect market acceptance and our reputation. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly in engineering and technical roles, and any inability to do so could materially affect our business.

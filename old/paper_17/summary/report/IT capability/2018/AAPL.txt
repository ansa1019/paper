The company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The company must make significant investments in research and development, and there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns. The company's products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and rapid technological change. The company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services. The company's financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. The company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services, and the success of new product and service introductions depends on timely and successful development, market acceptance, and the company's ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues. The company relies on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and other resellers, and it has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, which could require substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The company's business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions, which could adversely impact the company's business by preventing access to online services, interfering with customer transactions, or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of products. The company devotes significant resources to network and data security, but these measures cannot provide absolute security. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information could materially adversely affect the company's reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The company relies on third-party software developers, and decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. The company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends on developers' perceptions of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the company's products compared to competitors' platforms. The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, and the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. The company's business is subject to the risks of international operations, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. The company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the company's employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company's policies and procedures. The company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers, and while the company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments, an industrial accident could result in disruption to the company's business and harm to its reputation.

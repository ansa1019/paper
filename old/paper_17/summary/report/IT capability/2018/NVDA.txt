In evaluating Nvidia and our business, it is essential to consider the evolving needs of our markets and the identification of new products, services, or technologies, as failure to do so may adversely impact our revenue and financial results. Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and develop new or enhanced products, services, and technologies that meet these evolving needs. This requires considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales, and marketing investments. We must continue to develop the infrastructure necessary to appropriately scale our business, including customer service and support, while meeting customer safety and compliance standards that are subject to change. Additionally, we face risks related to competition in our current and target markets, where competitors may offer superior functionality or better features, potentially leading to lower selling prices for our products. Our reliance on third-party technology for manufacturing, assembly, testing, and packaging reduces our control over product quantity and quality, which could harm our business. We also depend on third-party software development tools to assist in the design and verification of new products, and delays in these tools can impact our ability to bring products to market in a timely manner. Furthermore, our operations could be disrupted by various factors, including natural disasters and cyber-attacks, which could harm our business and result in significant losses. The complexity of our products increases the risk of defects or security vulnerabilities that could damage our reputation and market share. Our dependency on third parties for critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems adds to these risks. We must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security features to defend against evolving security threats, which may increase our expenses. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is crucial for executing our business strategy effectively, as competition for skilled workers is intense. We have made considerable investments in research and development, which may not yield significant revenue for several years. Our strategic direction must result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers and shareholders. If we fail to anticipate changing market needs and technology trends, or adapt our strategy in a timely manner, our business will be harmed. Our financial performance is also influenced by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements and manage our tax liabilities effectively. The global nature of our business exposes us to various risks and uncertainties, including political conditions and changes in tax laws. Our operational flexibility and ability to respond to market dynamics are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving business performance objectives.

The semiconductor equipment industry and other industries that we serve are constantly developing and changing over time, with many risks associated with operating in these industries comparable to those faced by all technology companies. The ongoing changes in the technology industry could expose our business to significant risks, including the uncertainty of future growth rates, pricing trends, and changes in customers' capital spending patterns. Our ability to adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to these trends is critical; failing to develop new technologies and products that successfully address these changes could materially affect our business. The emergence of disruptive technologies that change prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes may impact inspection and metrology requirements, while the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities affects our customers' investment decisions. The bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry into leading-edge manufacturers and others content with existing products may also influence our business dynamics. Our customers' reuse of existing products may decrease their need for new purchases, and the higher design costs for advanced integrated circuits could constrain customers to focus on large, technologically advanced products. The timing, length, and severity of capital spending cycles are unpredictable, and our revenues are driven largely by our customers' spending on capital equipment and related maintenance services necessary to support key transitions in their underlying product technologies. Our success depends on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards, develop new products, and manufacture these products in a timely and cost-effective manner. We must continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance the performance, features, and functionality of our products. Our competitive advantage relies on our technology, which is the result of ongoing investments in product research and development. The complexity of our products exposes us to risks, as we recognize revenue upon shipment, which may ultimately fail to meet required specifications. Our management is constantly striving to balance customer requirements with resource availability, which impacts our ability to recognize revenue. We are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base, where orders from a limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of our sales. The consolidation of our customer base increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each customer, and any changes in ownership or management may result in challenges in managing customer relationships. Our operations are also subject to disruptions due to various factors, including natural disasters and geopolitical instability, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct business. We rely on certain critical information systems for our daily operations, and any inability to access these systems could unfavorably impact our business. Our future operating results depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace, which requires substantial and focused investments in research and development.

The companies reviewed the overall compensation pay structure, the overall mix of compensation vehicles, the structure of the incentive plans, and governance for oversight of program design and administration. They specifically examined the nature and mix of performance measures, the governance structure, and the extent to which the incentive structure rewards short-term decisions at the risk of long-term performance. The companies also considered other compensation policies, including clawback and anti-hedging policies, and concluded that there were no material issues regarding the executive pay programs, with the design of the incentive pay plans having a low-risk profile. The compensation committee receives advice from oversight committees regarding appropriate operational incentive measures. The companies have focused on improving public and employee safety and customer satisfaction, with specific performance measures tied to these goals. The compensation structure is designed to attract, retain, and motivate officers with the necessary skills and experience for the development and successful operation of the businesses. The committee believes that the proportions of base salary relative to target short-term and long-term incentives provide the right mix to align compensation with performance in achieving key operating results and long-term shareholder value. The committee approved a base salary increase budget of 3.25 percent, consistent with market expectations. The short-term incentive plan is an at-risk component of pay, with annual performance-based cash incentive compensation based on achievement of financial and operational goals. The committee retains discretion to determine and pay all awards, including the ability to adjust payments for external factors or individual performance. The long-term incentive awards are designed to align officer compensation with long-term performance and shareholder value, with performance shares linked to total shareholder return and safety and financial goals. The number of performance shares granted is determined based on the officer's actual annual award value and the performance measures. The vesting of restricted stock units and stock options is structured to align interests with those of shareholders, reflecting a longer-term view of the business environment. The companies have adopted a policy against crediting additional years of service for participants in the supplemental executive retirement plan, which provides additional pension benefits to officers and key employees. The companies also have a defined contribution executive supplemental retirement plan for newly hired or promoted officers. The officer severance policy provides for severance payments and the treatment of certain long-term incentive plan awards upon termination with cause, without cause, or in connection with a change in control. The policy aims to attract and retain senior management by providing competitive severance benefits. The companies have established a golden parachute restriction policy requiring shareholder approval of certain executive severance payments in connection with a change in control. The audit committees are responsible for overseeing the independent auditor's work, ensuring independence, and reviewing the scope of audits and related services. The audit-related fees include consultations on financial accounting and reporting standards, which are essential for maintaining effective governance and operational efficiency.

We rely extensively on information technology systems ("IT systems"), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to: communicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; receiving and processing orders from and shipping products to our customers and consumers; marketing products to consumers; collecting, storing transferring and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers and vendors; hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, intellectual property, business plans and financial information; summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; complying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes involved in managing our business. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers', IT systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups, individuals and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyber-attacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware. If we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our IT systems, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place; however, if our IT systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm, and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The initiatives under the global growth and efficiency program are focused on expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions, and optimizing global supply chain and facilities. These initiatives are expected to help the company ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales, operating profit and earnings per share and to enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses, producing significant benefits in the company's long-term business performance. We expect savings from the global growth and efficiency program, substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows, to be in the range of $590 to $635 pretax annually, once all projects are approved and implemented. The company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin care professionals and traditional and e-commerce retailers, enhancing its digital marketing capabilities and broadening its e-commerce offerings.

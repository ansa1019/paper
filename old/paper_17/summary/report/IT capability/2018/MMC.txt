The company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit, and store electronic information. The integration of information and technology systems during acquisitions poses significant challenges, including potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in an acquired entity's information systems, which could expose the company to unexpected liabilities or increase its vulnerability to cyber-attacks. The company faces ongoing challenges in managing access controls in a complex environment, where the latency of a compromise may be measured in months or years. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform into a competitive force. The threat of digital disruption and technological change necessitates the company to anticipate and respond effectively, requiring continued upgrades of legacy operating technology and investments in new technologies. The company has strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support its growth strategy, which may be costly and may not yield the expected profitability. The company’s ability to execute on its strategic initiatives is dependent on key vendors and partners providing necessary technology support. The company is also subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty, and other claims, which may divert personnel and management resources. The company’s information systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from external threats, including cyber-attacks and malware, as well as internal threats from employees and vendors. The company has experienced data incidents and cybersecurity breaches, which, while not materially adverse to date, could result in significant financial and reputational harm in the future. The company’s reliance on third-party vendors for technology and services introduces additional risks, as failures by these vendors could disrupt operations and impact the ability to offer products and services. The company’s business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if it fails to respond effectively to technological changes and the competitive landscape, which includes traditional players and new entrants utilizing technology and innovation. The company’s investments in technology and innovation partnerships are critical to maintaining competitive advantage and operational efficiency. The company’s ongoing efforts to improve its ability to protect data from compromise are essential, as the breadth and complexity of the technologies used continue to grow. The company recognizes that its ability to attract and retain employees and clients is highly dependent on its commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace, ethical business practices, and the effective management of information technology resources. The company’s operational flexibility and ability to respond to market dynamics are influenced by its IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of assets and internal processes, enhancing business strategies and work processes.

The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs; our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition and increasing fragmentation of customer viewing habits; the continued development and delivery of attractive and profitable video and broadband offerings; the extent to which regulatory and build-out requirements apply to our offerings; our ability to match speeds offered by our competitors and the availability, cost and/or reliability of the various technologies and/or content required to provide such offerings; our ability to manage growth in wireless data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms; our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies or delivery methods; the impact from major equipment failures on our networks, including satellites operated by directv; the effect of security breaches related to the network or customer information; and our inability to obtain handsets, equipment/software or have handsets, equipment/software serviced in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers. The final outcome of FCC and other federal, state or foreign government agency proceedings involving issues that are important to our business, including the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, could affect our operational flexibility and market positioning. Our ability to maintain margins, attract and offer a diverse portfolio of video, wireless service and devices is critical in the context of evolving market dynamics and competitive pressures. The uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions may result in a significant decrease in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general, which could impact our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions. Our increased exposure to foreign economies, including foreign exchange fluctuations as well as regulatory and political uncertainty, could also influence our operational capabilities and investment opportunities. The ability to absorb revenue losses and maintain competitive advantage in the face of technological changes and competitive actions is essential for sustaining firm performance. Changes in corporate strategies, such as changing network-related requirements or acquisitions and dispositions, may require significant amounts of cash or stock to respond to competition and regulatory, legislative and technological developments. Our ability to successfully integrate our WarnerMedia operations, including the ability to manage various businesses in widely dispersed business locations and with decentralized management, is crucial for enhancing our organizational capabilities and achieving business transformation. The availability, cost and our ability to adequately fund additional wireless spectrum and network upgrades are vital for maintaining operational efficiency and meeting consumer demands in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

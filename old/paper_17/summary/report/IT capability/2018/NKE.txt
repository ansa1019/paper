Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. Information technology systems are critical to many of Nike's operating activities and business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. The failure of these systems to operate effectively could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations, requiring significant capital investments to remediate problems, which may adversely affect reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. Nike's ability to effectively manage and maintain inventory and ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. The company has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions in which it operates, and its work to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems and related processes in global operations is ongoing, with continued investments in these efforts. Risks include difficulties in implementing, operating, and maintaining increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control. Additionally, interruptions in data and information technology systems and consumer data security pose significant risks. The company acknowledges that its digital commerce operations and retail stores must compete with multi-brand retailers and that rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences constitute significant risk factors in its operations. The competitive nature of retail, including shifts in consumer shopping behaviors and the rising trend of digital commerce, implicates Nike's direct and wholesale operations. Failure to adequately and timely anticipate and respond to competitors may lead to increased costs or a significant decline in consumer demand for products. The company's commitment to product innovation and quality, along with its investment in digital capabilities and consumer experiences, is essential for driving long-term growth under its consumer direct offense strategy. Nike's digital platforms and proprietary mobile applications are increasingly used to interact with customers, and any failure to provide effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms could place the company at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, the company is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect results, operations, or reputation, as it collects sensitive and proprietary business information, including transactional and personal information about customers. Any breach of its network or that of service providers may result in loss of confidential business data, damage to consumer relationships, and reputational harm, leading to lost sales and significant legal and remediation expenses.

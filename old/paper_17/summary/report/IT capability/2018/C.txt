Citi's overall strategy is to leverage its global footprint and be the pre-eminent bank for the emerging affluent and affluent consumers in large urban centers. The firm reported solid revenue growth across treasury and trade solutions, private bank, securities services, equity markets, and corporate lending in the Institutional Clients Group (ICG), partially offset by weakness in fixed income as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting. Citi demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in a decrease in expenses, while continuing to make ongoing investments. The firm’s IT capabilities have been evolving to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of its assets and internal processes, as well as their interfirm transactions and relationships. This evolution underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Citi's positive operating leverage, combined with continued credit discipline, resulted in an improvement in pretax earnings. The bank also generated continued loan and deposit growth during the year, reflecting a focus on further optimizing its performance to benefit shareholders while remaining flexible and adapting to market and economic conditions. In 2018, Citi continued to execute on its investment plans for Citibanamex, including initiatives to modernize the branch network, enhance digital capabilities, and upgrade core operating platforms. The increase in net income was driven by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. The firm’s revenues increased, driven by growth across all regions, and the average deposits increased, reflecting a focus on maintaining operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. The firm’s IT effectiveness is critical in supporting business needs and enhancing operational flexibility, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a challenging market environment. The integration of technology capabilities into Citi's operations is vital for improving organizational effectiveness and ensuring that the firm can respond to market dynamics and consumer demands effectively. The ongoing investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives are expected to enhance Citi's capability to manage risks and optimize performance outcomes. The firm’s approach to IT governance and resource management is designed to ensure that technology resources are aligned with strategic business objectives, thereby facilitating innovation and improving overall firm performance. As such, Citi's IT capabilities play a crucial role in its ability to navigate the complexities of the financial services landscape and to capitalize on emerging opportunities in a rapidly evolving market.

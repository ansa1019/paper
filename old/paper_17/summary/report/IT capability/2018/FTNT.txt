Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable. Our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and services to existing customers is critical, as is the effectiveness of our sales organization. The level of perceived threats to network security may fluctuate, impacting customer purchasing behavior and the timing of revenue recognition. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and the economic health of our current and prospective customers, with weak economic conditions potentially leading to longer sales cycles and lower prices for our products and services. We rely significantly on revenue from our Fortiguard security subscription and Forticare technical support services, which may fluctuate based on customer satisfaction and purchasing practices. Our sales strategy is based on a two-tier distribution model, and we depend on our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities. The effectiveness of our channel partners in selling our products is essential, as their financial health can directly impact our sales and operating results. We have implemented a cloud-based quoting tool to enhance sales productivity, but any delays in order processing could adversely affect our financial results. Our reliance on information technology to manage critical functions such as order configuration, pricing, revenue recognition, and supply chain management underscores the importance of improving our systems and processes. We have been slow to adopt certain automated functions, which could negatively impact our business. The management of our inventory is complex, and any mismanagement could adversely affect our results of operations. We also face challenges in maintaining and expanding our ERP and CRM systems, which are critical for forecasting orders, processing orders, and providing customer support. Our future performance depends on the continued services and contributions of our senior management, and the loss of key personnel could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives. Our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel is crucial, particularly in network security, where competition for talent is intense. The market for network security products is rapidly evolving, and our success depends on our ability to respond promptly to technological developments and changing customer needs. We must continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings and maintain our competitive position. Our products must interoperate effectively with those of other vendors, and any difficulties in this area could delay market acceptance of our products. Additionally, we are subject to various regulatory requirements that could impose added costs on our business and impact our ability to operate effectively. The ongoing evolution of the internet and computing environments necessitates continual improvement in our product functionality, features, and reliability. Our ability to provide effective technical support services is also critical, as our end-customers depend on us to resolve issues related to our products. Failure to meet the requirements of larger end-customers could hinder our strategy to increase penetration in key markets.

The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs; our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies or delivery methods; the extent of competition including from governmental networks and other providers and the resulting pressure on customer and access line totals and segment operating margins; our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition; the ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to lower cost structures and regulatory and legislative actions adverse to us; changes in our corporate strategies, such as changing network requirements or acquisitions and dispositions, which may require significant amounts of cash or stock, to respond to competition and regulatory, legislative and technological developments; and our ability to manage growth in wireless data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms. Additionally, the impact on our networks, including satellites operated by DirectTV, and business from major equipment failures; security breaches related to the network or customer information; our inability to obtain handsets, equipment/software or have handsets, equipment/software serviced; and severe weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, energy shortages, wars or terrorist attacks may also affect our operational capabilities. Our ability to integrate our acquisition of DirectTV and adequately fund our wireless operations, including payment for additional spectrum, network upgrades and technological advancements, is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. The uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions may result in a significant reduction in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general and on our products and services specifically, due to this fiscal uncertainty. The final outcome of FCC and other federal or state agency proceedings involving issues that are important to our business, including the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, is also a significant factor. Our ability to attract and offer a diverse portfolio of wireless service and devices, device financing plans, and maintain margins is essential for our market positioning. The availability and cost of additional wireless spectrum and regulations and conditions relating to spectrum use, licensing, obtaining additional spectrum, technical standards, and deployment and usage, including network management rules, will influence our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. Furthermore, the enactment of additional state, federal and/or foreign regulatory and tax laws and regulations pertaining to our subsidiaries and foreign investments may reduce our incentive to invest in our networks, resulting in lower revenue growth and/or higher operating costs. The continued development and delivery of attractive and profitable video offerings through satellite and U-verse, and the availability, cost and/or reliability of the various technologies and/or content required to provide such offerings, are also critical to our business strategy alignment and performance outcomes.

Ongoing changes in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, expose our business to significant risks, including the uncertainty of future growth rates and shifts in customer capital spending patterns. If we fail to adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to these trends or do not timely develop new technologies that address these changes, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. The semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by constant technological innovation, and our competitive advantage depends on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop new products that address changing customer needs. Our management monitors trends that include the increasing cost of building fabrication facilities, differing market growth rates, and the emergence of disruptive technologies that impact manufacturing processes. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with significant orders from a limited number of manufacturers, which increases our exposure to risks related to individual customer actions and market dynamics. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry affects our ability to predict future revenue and expenses, and we must respond to industry cycles to remain competitive. Our success relies on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions, necessitating substantial investments in research and development to enhance product performance and functionality. We are also exposed to risks associated with our highly concentrated customer base, as orders from a limited number of manufacturers account for a significant portion of our sales, leading to increased volatility in our operating results. Our ability to manage customer relationships is further complicated by ownership changes and alliances formed by our customers. We face competition from larger companies with greater resources and from smaller emerging firms that leverage innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Our operational flexibility is critical, as we must adjust our manufacturing capacity and personnel in response to customer demand. We rely on third-party service providers for various functions, including information systems management, which reduces our control over service quality and compliance. Our information systems are integral to our operations, and any disruptions could adversely affect our ability to process and report financial results accurately. We allocate significant resources to cybersecurity measures to protect our data and intellectual property, but our systems remain susceptible to breaches. Our future performance depends on our ability to innovate and respond to changing market conditions, and we must effectively manage our technology resources and capabilities to maintain our competitive position. The complexity of our products and the reliance on external suppliers for high-technology components further complicate our operational landscape. Our management practices and strategic resource allocation are essential to navigate the challenges posed by market dynamics and technological advancements.

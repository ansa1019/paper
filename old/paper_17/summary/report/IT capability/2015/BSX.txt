Our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by intense competition and the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. The medical device markets are characterized by extensive research and development, and developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes, or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. We continue to experience pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity and the increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates. Our international operations are subject to various market, business, financial, legal, and regulatory risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on our business. We are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in emerging markets, which involves significant investment in infrastructure. Our ability to attract or retain key personnel is critical, as competition for key employees is substantial, particularly in emerging markets. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology and evolving regulatory standards. The integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, which can result in additional expenses and involve significant management time. Our restructuring initiatives aim to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success, focusing on operational effectiveness and efficiency while preserving our ability to invest in research and development projects. We monitor the dynamics of the economy and the healthcare industry to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency. Our ability to manage our debt levels and maintain investment-grade credit ratings is essential for our financial condition. We have recorded significant litigation-related charges that may impact our financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny, and any adverse regulatory action could restrict our ability to market and sell our products effectively. Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials, and regulatory approvals. The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions, investments, or alliances will depend on our ability to identify suitable opportunities and integrate acquired businesses effectively. Our strategic acquisitions and investments are intended to expand our ability to offer effective, high-quality medical devices that satisfy customer needs.

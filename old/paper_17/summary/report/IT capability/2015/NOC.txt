Our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, including those associated with our reliance on information technology capabilities. We depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S. government, for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in this customer's priorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. The U.S. government has been implementing significant reductions in spending, which could impact our operational efficiency and ability to deploy IT resources effectively. Significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs may negatively impact our business and programs, potentially affecting our IT governance and resource allocation decisions. We face various cyber and security threats that could disrupt our IT systems, leading to losses of sensitive information and capabilities, which could damage our reputation and ability to compete effectively. Our success in the competitive defense industry depends upon our ability to develop technologically advanced, innovative, and cost-effective products and services, which are integral to our IT capabilities. We must maintain technologies, facilities, equipment, and a qualified workforce to meet the evolving needs of our customers, which underscores the importance of our IT architecture and management capability. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security is critical, as is the capability to tailor these in response to changing business needs. Our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation are influenced by our IT investment decisions, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage. The evolving nature of our IT capabilities encompasses the coordination of our assets and internal processes, as well as our interfirm transactions and relationships. We are subject to various investigations and litigation that could divert financial and management resources, potentially impacting our IT resources and capabilities. Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including compliance with laws and regulations that could affect our IT systems and data management practices. The ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with the necessary skills and security clearances is vital for our IT effectiveness and overall organizational performance. Our business strategy alignment and market responsiveness are closely tied to our IT capabilities, which must adapt to the dynamic changes in the market and regulatory contexts. The impact of budget and program decisions made in the current political and economic environment will have long-term implications for our IT capabilities and overall business performance. We must continue to invest in our technology portfolio and ensure our IT systems are robust enough to support our operational and strategic objectives, as failure to do so could result in significant performance impacts and challenges in meeting our organizational goals.

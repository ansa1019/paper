We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, including the potential for customers to delay or reduce technology purchases due to adverse economic conditions. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of our technologies. Our transition to cloud-based products and more flexible product licenses requires considerable investment in technical, financial, legal, and sales resources, and a scalable organization. Market acceptance of such offerings is affected by factors including security, reliability, performance, and customer concerns regarding data management. We are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects, and we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which may not always result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs. The software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving customer requirements, necessitating constant evaluation of our business model and strategy. Our ability to achieve financial objectives is subject to uncertainties, including customer demand and our ability to develop and scale infrastructure. We have initiated a restructuring plan to accelerate our move to the cloud and transition to a subscription-based business model, which involves reallocating resources to align with company needs. Our software is complex and may contain undetected errors, defects, or vulnerabilities that could harm our business performance. We rely on third-party technologies and services, and any disruption or failure in these areas could adversely impact our operations. Our business model transition metrics indicate a shift towards subscription-based revenue, which is expected to provide more predictable cash flows over time. We recognize the importance of maintaining good relationships with our distribution channels, as their financial stability directly affects our revenue generation. Our international operations expose us to regulatory, economic, and political risks that could adversely impact our financial results. We are committed to leveraging our technology capabilities and extensive distributor network to enhance our competitive positioning in the market. The transition from perpetual licenses to a subscription model is expected to expand our customer base and provide more flexibility in accessing our products. However, this transition may also lead to fluctuations in revenue recognition and cash flow. Our ongoing investments in IT capabilities are critical to supporting our business strategies and enhancing operational efficiency. We continuously assess our internal controls and financial reporting processes to ensure accuracy and reliability, as any deficiencies could undermine investor confidence and affect our stock price. Our strategic initiatives are designed to align with evolving market dynamics and customer needs, ultimately driving business transformation and performance improvement.

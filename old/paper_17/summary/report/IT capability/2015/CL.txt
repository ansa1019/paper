In an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our patent, trademark and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors. The successful implementation of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and may require successful negotiations with third parties. The 2012 restructuring program's initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses. The initiatives under the 2012 restructuring program continue to be focused on expanding commercial hubs, extending shared business services and streamlining global functions, and optimizing the global supply chain and facilities. The company seeks to capture significant opportunities for growth by identifying and meeting consumer needs within its core categories, through its focus on innovation and the deployment of valuable consumer and shopper insights in the development of successful new products regionally, which are then rolled out on a global basis. The company has developed key initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental and veterinary professionals and retail customers. The identification, development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs, and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our uses of IT systems include communicating within the company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, receiving and processing orders from and shipping products to our customers, marketing products to consumers, collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers, hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information, complying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements, providing data security, and handling other processes involved in managing our business. Although we have network security measures in place, our IT systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers', IT systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. Furthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our IT systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business, as well as reputational harm and litigation, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions. Operational risks include information technology system failure, cyber intrusion, and compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cybersecurity standards. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power face the risk of physical and cyber attacks against their respective generation facilities, transmission, and distribution infrastructure, and information technology systems, which could negatively impact their ability to generate, transport, and deliver power. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Despite the implementation of robust security measures, all assets are potentially vulnerable to failures or unauthorized access due to human error, technological failure, or internal or external physical or cyber attacks. If the traditional operating companies' or Southern Power's assets were to fail or be breached, they may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive data could be compromised, resulting in penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power's reliance on technology changes in the power and fuel industries continues to create significant impacts on wholesale transaction cost structures. Furthermore, the financial condition, net income, and cash flows of Southern Company and its subsidiaries could be adversely affected by changes in power prices and fuel costs, which may reduce revenues and increase costs. The market prices for these commodities may fluctuate significantly, influenced by factors such as demand for energy, liquidity in the wholesale electricity market, and the financial condition of market participants. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power are subject to risks associated with a changing economic environment, customer behaviors, and the adoption patterns of technologies by their customers. The consumption and use of energy are fundamentally linked to economic activity, and any economic downturn could negatively impact customer growth and usage per customer, thus reducing electricity sales and revenues. Additionally, changes in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs and the adoption of new technologies could affect the relationship between economic activity and electricity consumption. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power's ability to successfully access funds through capital markets and financial institutions is crucial for executing their business plans and funding capital investments. If they are unable to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, their ability to implement business plans will be limited. The traditional operating companies and Southern Power are also obligated to supply power to retail and wholesale customers under long-term power purchase agreements, which could lead to challenges in meeting demand during peak times if generation capacity is insufficient. The traditional operating companies' planning processes must appropriately estimate and incorporate the impacts of changes in customer behavior, state and federal programs, and technology to avoid adverse effects on financial results.

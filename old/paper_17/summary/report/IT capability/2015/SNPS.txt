The growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries, and the increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips and integrated circuits has led to a focus on managing costs. Demand for our products and services could decrease if growth in these industries slows or stalls. As the electronic design automation (EDA) industry matures, consolidation may result in stronger competition, which could negatively impact our revenue growth rate and operating margins. We work closely with major foundries to ensure compatibility of our EDA, IP, and manufacturing solutions with their processes, as failing to optimize these solutions may render them less desirable to customers. Consolidation among our customers may lead to fewer customers, increased bargaining power, or reduced spending on software and services, adversely affecting our business. Our growth strategy includes building on our leadership in EDA products, expanding our IP offerings, and driving growth in the software quality and security market. Our solutions help customers develop advanced electronics products while reducing design and manufacturing costs. We maintain profitability and positive cash flow due to our time-based revenue model, which allows us to recognize revenue over the life of contracts. Our investments in software quality and security, particularly following recent acquisitions, have expanded our total addressable market. We face risks in managing our acquisitions, including the integration of acquired technologies and the potential for increased operational risks. Our ability to innovate and introduce new products is crucial in a highly competitive environment characterized by rapid technological evolution and changing customer requirements. We compete on the basis of technology, product quality, and customer support. Our research and development expenditures are significant, and we must balance investments in new technologies with those in existing products. We rely on a global network of technology systems for our operations, and disruptions to these systems could adversely affect our business. Cybersecurity threats pose a risk to sensitive data, and breaches could harm our reputation and financial performance. Our financial results are also influenced by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in tax laws. We must effectively manage our cash flows, which are impacted by the timing of billings and collections, and we rely on our credit facilities to meet liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio is subject to risks associated with capital markets, and we actively manage these risks to ensure financial stability. Our operational flexibility is essential in responding to market dynamics and customer demands, and we continuously evaluate our strategic resource allocation to enhance our capabilities and performance.

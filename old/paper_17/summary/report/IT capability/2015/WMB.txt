The reports, filings, and other public announcements of the Williams Companies, Inc. may contain statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts, including forward-looking statements regarding anticipated financial performance, management's plans, and objectives for future operations, which may involve the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. The integration of our business following the proposed merger will involve considerable risks, including the integration of personnel, operations, and systems, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our reliance on information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information is critical for operational efficiency and customer relationships. We face cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include unlawful attempts to gain access to our systems. The age and condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats, which may impact our operational capabilities. The integration process following the merger may not be successful, and achieving anticipated benefits will depend on effective integration of assets, operations, functions, and personnel while maintaining adequate focus on core businesses. Our ongoing strategy is to safely and reliably operate large-scale, interstate natural gas transmission and midstream infrastructures, which includes significant capital expenditures for technology deployment and infrastructure capability. The anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized if we fail to effectively manage the integration process, which could adversely affect our business performance and operational flexibility. We continue to focus on providing large-scale energy infrastructure designed to maximize opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and crude oil, which requires strategic resource allocation and effective management capabilities. Our growth capital and investment expenditures are expected to total approximately $2.2 billion, which includes investments in gathering and processing systems limited to known new producer volumes. The ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties, which is influenced by market dynamics and competitive actions. Our operations are subject to regulatory scrutiny, which may impact our ability to establish transportation and storage rates that allow recovery of costs, including those associated with compliance with environmental standards. Our business strategy is increasingly fee-based, which mitigates the influence of commodity price fluctuations on our operating results and cash flows, while we remain indirectly exposed to longer-duration depressed energy commodity prices. The execution of our integration strategy following the merger will depend on our ability to realize anticipated benefits from combining separate businesses, which may involve significant challenges related to operational integration and maintaining relationships with service providers and customers.

The company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications, and broadband communications. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change, and the company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business, competing primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service, and delivery time. The company’s long-term results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source, and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines. The company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment, believing that its global presence is an important competitive advantage as it allows the company to provide quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. The company’s strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products, and a high level of service while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing broad diversification, developing performance-enhancing interconnect solutions, expanding global presence, controlling costs, pursuing strategic acquisitions and investments, and fostering collaborative, entrepreneurial management. The company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers, and sales to the information technology and data communications market increased primarily due to the growth in products for server, web, and data center applications. The company’s ability to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions requires access to the capital markets, and its results may be negatively affected by changing interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and general economic conditions. Cybersecurity incidents on the company’s information technology systems could disrupt business operations, resulting in adverse impacts to its reputation and operating results and potentially lead to litigation. The company has implemented preventative security measures to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate these threats, which include continuous monitoring of its information technology systems and networks and maintenance of backup systems. The company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, and various factors could adversely impact its business and operating results, including a global economic slowdown, uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions, and unforeseen interruptions to the company’s business with its largest customers, distributors, and suppliers. The company’s ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of its fundamental financial strengths, allowing it significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders' equity, with a history of borrowing funds domestically at reasonable interest rates. The company’s strategic focus on technology management and operational efficiency is crucial for maintaining competitive positioning within the rapidly evolving communications and information technology sectors.

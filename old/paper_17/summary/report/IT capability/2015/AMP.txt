Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including technological changes and events, which can materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. The availability and cost of capital, as well as the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices, and interest rates, are influenced by market fluctuations and economic factors. Our financial condition may also be impacted by the performance of our investment management services, which are closely tied to market dynamics and the overall economic environment. The profitability of our products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, which can be affected by declines in equity markets. Furthermore, our ability to achieve strategic objectives may be hindered by changes in consumer economic variables and client activity levels, which are influenced by external factors such as market conditions and investor sentiment.

We face intense competition in the financial services industry, competing based on factors including service quality, investment performance, and perceived financial strength. Our competitors may possess greater market share or higher claims-paying ability, which could impact our ability to introduce new products and services. The operational effectiveness of our technology infrastructure is crucial for processing transactions and providing products and services to clients, and any interruptions or failures in these systems could harm our business. We rely on third-party service providers for certain technology functions, and operational failures or inaccuracies in data reporting could adversely affect our operations.

Our business is reliant upon internal and third-party personnel and technology systems to process, transmit, and store information, including sensitive client and proprietary information. Maintaining the integrity of these systems is critical to our business operations and the protection of proprietary information. Cybersecurity threats pose risks to our operational systems and networks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client information and damage to our reputation. We have implemented security measures to protect against breaches, but we cannot assure that our systems will not be subject to attacks or interference.

The success of our strategic objectives may be affected by the evolving regulatory landscape, which includes increased scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest and the need to comply with various laws and regulations. Our ability to manage risks associated with operational, legal, and regulatory factors is essential for maintaining our competitive position. The integration of technology into our operations is critical for enhancing our service offerings and achieving operational efficiencies.

Investment performance is a key factor in our business, and poor performance could impair revenues and earnings. Our financial performance is also influenced by the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, as well as the effectiveness of our management strategies. The dynamics of the financial services market, including changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions, necessitate a focus on innovation and responsiveness to market demands. We continuously assess our technology capabilities and operational processes to ensure alignment with business strategies and to enhance our overall effectiveness in the marketplace.

The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including the ongoing decline in prices for oil and natural gas, which may continue to adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth, production, and the present value of our estimated reserves. Our revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth, and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. The volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. Our ability to acquire, locate, and produce economically new reserves is critical, and our development and exploration operations require substantial capital. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves. We rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business, and the loss of services from our executive team could disrupt our operations. Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water, and restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements, and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if we cannot keep pace with these developments. Our operations depend on the availability of skilled labor, materials, and equipment, and the inability to secure the personnel necessary for our operations could lead to a reduction in production volumes. We are also subject to cyber security risks, as our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our vendors may become targets of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could disrupt our business operations. Our information systems and computer-based programs are heavily relied upon, and any failure could result in significant operational disruptions. We have incurred losses from operations during certain periods and may do so in the future, which could impede our ability to economically find, develop, and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on whether significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development, production, exploration, and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. The accuracy of our assessments regarding recoverable reserves and future cash flows is inherently uncertain, and material inaccuracies could significantly affect our financial condition. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing and regulatory approvals, and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations may involve unforeseen difficulties and require substantial managerial and financial resources. The trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue, which may impose additional costs and operational restrictions. We are required to comply with various governmental laws and regulations, and failure to do so may result in penalties and increased compliance costs. Our business is difficult to evaluate due to our limited operating history, and we may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

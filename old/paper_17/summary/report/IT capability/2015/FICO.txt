We continue to expand the pursuit of our decision management strategy, which is designed to enable us to increase our business by selling multiple products to clients and developing custom client solutions. Our growth and the success of our decision management strategy depend upon our ability to develop and sell new products or suites of products, including cloud-based offerings. Our business requires that we develop or obtain a reliable source of sufficient amounts of current and statistically relevant data to analyze transactions and update our products, which is essential for maintaining our information management capability. We rely on relationships with third parties for marketing, distribution, and certain services, and difficulties in these relationships could adversely affect our future revenues. The complexity of our products necessitates highly trained customer service and technical support personnel, and the competitive labor market for these individuals could hinder our ability to manage our business effectively. Our reengineering initiative aims to improve profitability through strategic resource allocation, but its long-term success is uncertain. The market may be unreceptive to our business approach, which could affect our growth prospects. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of products and services, and if the market does not continue to accept these, our revenues will decline. Our ability to innovate and effectively respond to changing customer needs is critical, as failure to keep pace with technological developments could render our products less competitive. We expect competition in the business analytics market to persist and intensify, and our competitors may have greater resources to respond to new technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our future success will depend on our ability to leverage our IT capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and support business needs. The occurrence of negative events may cause fluctuations in our stock price, which could impact our ability to attract and retain personnel. We have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products, primarily due to difficulties in acquiring data and adapting to client systems. Our reliance on proprietary technology rights is crucial, and any failure to protect these rights could harm our competitive position. Security breaches could expose us to risks of loss and unauthorized disclosure of information, damaging our reputation and business. We must also navigate various regulatory environments that influence our operations and the expectations of our customers. Our growth strategy includes pursuing opportunities outside the U.S., which presents unique risks. The potential for economic disruption poses considerable risks to our business, including declines in transaction volumes for our customers. Our ability to manage and allocate resources effectively is essential for sustaining our operational capabilities and achieving our strategic objectives.

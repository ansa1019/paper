We operate in an environment that involves significant risks and uncertainties, which could affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. Our commercialization efforts for products like Eylea and Praluent depend on various factors, including the effectiveness of our commercial strategies, our ability to communicate product benefits, and the maintenance of sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. The success of our products is also contingent upon our ability to effectively manage our information technology systems, which support business processes and communications. We rely on our collaboration with Bayer Healthcare for the commercialization of Eylea outside the United States, and any failure in this collaboration could materially impair our ability to sustain profitability. Our IT systems are critical for supporting our research and development activities, and disruptions or breaches in these systems could adversely affect our operations. We have outsourced significant elements of our IT infrastructure, which may expose us to vulnerabilities related to data security breaches. Our ability to manage and leverage IT capabilities is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and supporting our strategic objectives. The ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight we face require robust information management capabilities to ensure compliance and effective communication with regulatory authorities. Our research and development expenses are significant, and we must effectively allocate resources to support our clinical programs, which are influenced by our IT capabilities. The complexity of our IT systems necessitates continuous investment to enhance their functionality and security, ensuring that we can respond to market dynamics and maintain competitive advantage. Our financial performance is linked to our ability to optimize our IT architecture and governance, which in turn impacts our operational flexibility and resource deployment. As we expand our manufacturing capacity and commercial capabilities, we must ensure that our IT systems can support these growth initiatives. The integration of IT into our business processes is vital for enhancing our organizational capabilities and achieving our strategic goals. Additionally, the competitive landscape in the biotechnology industry requires us to continuously innovate and adapt our IT resources to meet evolving business needs. Our reliance on third-party service providers for IT support presents challenges, as their performance directly affects our operational effectiveness. Therefore, maintaining strong IT governance and management practices is crucial for mitigating risks and ensuring the successful commercialization of our products. The interplay between our IT capabilities and overall business strategy is fundamental to achieving long-term success and sustaining profitability in a rapidly changing market environment.

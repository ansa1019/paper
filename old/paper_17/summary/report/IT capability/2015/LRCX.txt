The semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability, and we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions despite the recent reduction in cyclicality. The industry environment has moved toward variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry. Variability in our customers' business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results. Our management must adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services. We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. Our success will depend significantly on the ability of our executive officers and senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. We maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business, including telecommunications, the internet, and various computer hardware and software applications. These information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources, which could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. We have implemented security procedures to mitigate risks associated with information systems under our control, but these measures cannot guarantee complete safety. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to our success, as intense competition for top talent can impact our operational capabilities. We are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change, as our future success depends on our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. Our business is affected by our customers' use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes, and should technologies change, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on less concentrated competitors. We depend on creating new products and processes, and enhancing existing products and processes for our success. Our ability to respond to changing business needs and directions is crucial, particularly in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, and information systems. We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and to remain competitive, we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products and maintain customer service and support centers worldwide. Our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt, which could adversely affect our financial condition. We rely on certain critical information systems for the operation of our business, and any disruption in these systems could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products, and generate revenues. Our ability to comply with evolving standards of corporate governance and public disclosure requires investment in resources, and changes in regulations may present risks to our business, including potential fines and reputational damage. Our management strategy includes reviewing acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products and enhance our technological capabilities, which entails operational and financial risks. The outcomes of strategic alliances and customer consolidation may also negatively affect our business, as customers may re-evaluate their supplier relationships based on their operational needs and purchasing power.

BB&T invests significant resources in information technology system enhancements to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. The company may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The ongoing implementation of IT projects and the associated costs may materially adversely affect BB&T's business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, BB&T faces cybersecurity risks, including denial of service attacks and hacking, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information and create significant legal and financial exposure. The company’s computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks, and while BB&T has not experienced a breach of client data, the performance of its website has been adversely affected by such attacks. BB&T’s reliance on third-party vendors for key components of its business infrastructure, such as internet connections and network access, also poses risks, as any failure by these vendors could adversely affect BB&T’s ability to deliver products and services. Furthermore, BB&T's business is dependent on the ability to process, record, and monitor a large number of complex transactions, and operational breakdowns or failures could materially adversely affect its business. The company recognizes that the integration of acquired entities’ information technology systems is critical for achieving anticipated cost savings and synergies, and complications in this integration could result in operational problems and reduced cost savings. BB&T’s risk management framework includes a focus on technology capabilities and the integration of IT resources to enhance operational efficiency and support business strategies. The company’s management considers the impact of new technologies and evolving consumer preferences on market share and customer loyalty, emphasizing the need for continuous innovation to remain competitive. BB&T’s strategic objectives are influenced by the dynamics of the financial services industry, including the adoption of new technologies by competitors and the increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. The company’s IT governance and management practices are designed to ensure that risks associated with technology deployment and operational processes are effectively managed, aligning with its overall business strategy and performance goals. BB&T's commitment to enhancing its IT capabilities is integral to maintaining its competitive position and achieving long-term business success in a rapidly changing market environment.

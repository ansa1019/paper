The company depends in large part on its technology systems for conducting business and processing claims, as well as for providing the data and analytics utilized to manage its business. The effectiveness of existing technology systems and the continuous development and enhancement of technology systems that support business processes and strategic initiatives are critical for business success. The company has experienced difficulties with technology, data security, and outsourcing relationships, which could negatively impact its ability to conduct business. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more facilities, a power outage, or a failure of information technology systems could significantly impair the company's ability to perform necessary business functions. The company is also exposed to risks from cyber-attacks and other disruptions that could compromise the confidentiality of information processed and stored in its systems. The reliance on third-party systems, including cloud-based technology, increases the risk of service denials or failures of controls. The company recognizes the importance of effectively managing and upgrading its technology portfolio, including the technology portfolio of recently acquired businesses, to provide competitive services to customers in a cost-effective manner. The company's business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology. The company utilizes various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with them. The company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its proprietary modeling processes. The company's investment strategy is designed to support its insurance operations, with a focus on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments and executes investment purchases and sales to ensure adequate funds are available to satisfy insurance and debt obligations. The company's ability to adapt to changes in business models, customer preferences, and regulatory environments is crucial for maintaining competitive positioning. The company recognizes that the competitive environment is influenced by technological changes, including the emergence of digital technologies and alternative distribution channels that may disrupt traditional business models. The company's operational flexibility and decision-making speed are essential for responding to market dynamics and external influences. The integration of technology capabilities across its operations is vital for enhancing organizational effectiveness and achieving strategic resource allocation. The company continually refines its claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, which involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to various internal and external factors, including changes in claims handling procedures, economic conditions, and legal trends. The company's management believes that its technology capabilities are integral to transforming its business and enhancing its competitive advantage in the marketplace.

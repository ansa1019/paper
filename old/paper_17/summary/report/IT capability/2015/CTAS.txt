Cintas relies extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information, and manage its businesses. Disruptions in the availability of computer systems, or privacy breaches involving computer systems, could impact the ability to service customers and adversely affect sales, results of operations, and reputation, exposing the company to litigation risk. The businesses depend on these systems to provide customer information, process transactions, and manage operations. Although Cintas has an active disaster recovery plan that is frequently reviewed and tested, the computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to various factors, including system conversions, power outages, and catastrophic events. The unpredictability of such disruptions could lead to production downtimes, operational delays, and interruptions in the ability to provide products and services to customers, potentially requiring significant investments to fix or replace affected systems. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and may include malicious software and unauthorized access attempts that could disrupt systems, lead to unauthorized release of confidential information, and corrupt data. If the network of security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, and monitoring systems fails, the compromising of confidential information or destruction of data could result in financial losses, loss of business, or potential liability, damaging the company's reputation. Effective internal controls are necessary for Cintas to provide reliable financial reports, and any failure to maintain these controls could adversely affect the business and stock price. The company evaluates its internal controls regularly, but cannot guarantee that these measures will ensure the implementation and maintenance of adequate controls over financial processes and reporting. Cintas faces challenges in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions, which is critical for maintaining its corporate culture and operational efficiency. Competitive pressures may make it more difficult and expensive to attract and retain key employees, adversely affecting business performance. Unexpected events, including natural disasters and supply disruptions, could disrupt operations and adversely affect results. The company assesses its goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment when required, and any impairment could adversely affect financial condition and results of operations. Cintas' ability to expand its presence in existing markets and enter new markets depends on identifying attractive locations and complying with various regulations, which could impact operational flexibility and resource allocation. The company also evaluates opportunities for acquiring businesses to supplement internal growth, but the success of any acquisition depends on the ability to integrate the acquired company effectively. The integration process may involve unforeseen difficulties and require significant management attention and resources. Overall, Cintas' IT capabilities play a crucial role in supporting business needs, enhancing operational efficiency, and enabling strategic resource allocation, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving long-term business objectives.

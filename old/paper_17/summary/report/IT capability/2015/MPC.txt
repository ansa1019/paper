We rely on the performance of our information technology systems, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are heavily dependent on our information technology systems and network infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems involve data network and telecommunications, internet access and website functionality, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our business. These systems and infrastructure are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. We also face various other cyber-security threats, including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable. To protect against such attempts of unauthorized access or attack, we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies and disaster recovery plans. There can be no guarantee such plans, to the extent they are in place, will be effective. Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. Failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe to be prudent against many, but not all, potential liabilities arising from operating hazards. Uninsured liabilities arising from operating hazards, including but not limited to, explosions, fires, refinery or pipeline releases or other incidents involving our assets or operations, could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our capital expenditures and investments are essential for maintaining operational efficiency and supporting our strategic objectives, including the integration of technology capabilities that enhance our competitive positioning in the market. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant, which includes investments in technology infrastructure and systems that are critical for our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The development, availability and marketing of alternative and competing fuels in the retail market could adversely impact our business. We compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel needs of our consumers. Increased competition from these alternatives as a result of governmental regulations, technological advances and consumer demand could have an impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability. Our business strategy includes leveraging our information technology capabilities to optimize our business processes and enhance our decision-making speed in response to market dynamics. The integration of information systems and technology management practices is vital for ensuring the reliability and security of our data management processes, which directly impacts our operational effectiveness and overall firm performance. As we continue to invest in our technology portfolio, we aim to enhance our capabilities in data analytics and information processing, which are crucial for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving business environment.

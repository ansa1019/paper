Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including our ability to retain existing users or add new users, which is critical to our success. Our financial performance has been significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users. If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or maintain or increase their engagement. User engagement patterns have changed over time, and we face competition from companies that provide tools to facilitate communication and the sharing of information, which presents an ongoing threat to our business. Our ability to compete effectively depends on factors including the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising, and our ability to grow advertising revenue will continue to depend on our ability to generate revenue from ads displayed on mobile devices. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. Any changes in such systems or in our relationships with mobile operating system partners could adversely affect the usage of our products. Our business is highly competitive, and we may face challenges from competitors who may develop products, features, or services that achieve greater acceptance or undertake more successful product development efforts. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers, is crucial for maintaining our competitive position. We have made and intend to continue making acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary technologies, which may not yield favorable returns on investment. Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial results. We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, which requires significant time and resources to integrate successfully. Our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors or vulnerabilities, our business could be adversely affected. We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business, including privacy and data protection, which could result in claims, changes to our business practices, or monetary penalties. Our management capability is challenged by the growth and expansion of our business, and we must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems to effectively manage our growth. The loss of key personnel could disrupt our operations, and our ability to attract and retain personnel may be adversely affected by stock price volatility. We have made significant investments in our core products and services, as well as in next-generation services and long-term innovation efforts, which we expect will drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth.

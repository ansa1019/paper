Our business operations are highly dependent on the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials, and parts necessary for manufacturing our products, which requires effective coordination of our information technology capabilities. We rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain management and invoicing. The secure operation of these information technology networks is critical to our business operations and strategy, and any disruptions could compromise our networks and the information stored there, potentially resulting in significant adverse effects on our business and results of operations. Our planned investment in new technology is significant, and we intend to invest heavily in alternative fuel and advanced propulsion technologies, which are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage in the automotive market. However, the successful launch of new vehicles, which depends on our ability to implement improved technological innovations, requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit new talent. We face challenges in maintaining profitability, which is contingent upon our ability to introduce new and improved vehicle models that meet consumer expectations and market demands. The automotive industry is highly competitive, and our future competitiveness depends on our ability to control costs through effective restructuring initiatives and productivity improvements. Our strategic plan includes investments in our product portfolio and a revised brand strategy, which are necessary to enhance our operational efficiency and market responsiveness. Additionally, we are committed to leveraging our information management capabilities to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security. The integration of advanced technologies into our operations is vital for transforming our business processes and enhancing our organizational capabilities. We recognize that our IT capabilities must evolve to support the coordination of our assets and internal processes, as well as our interfirm transactions and relationships. This evolution is essential for achieving operational flexibility and improving our market-based performance. Our reliance on information technology also extends to managing customer relationships and ensuring the confidentiality and security of sensitive data. The occurrence of security breaches could significantly disrupt our operations and compromise the integrity of our proprietary information. As we continue to assess our performance, we recognize the importance of enhancing our IT governance and resource mobilization to effectively respond to market dynamics and external influences. Our ability to manage these challenges will ultimately impact our organizational effectiveness and long-term profitability.

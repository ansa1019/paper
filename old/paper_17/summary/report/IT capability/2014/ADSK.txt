We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, including those related to technology purchases by customers. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in reductions in sales of our products and services. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties, particularly as we transition to cloud-based products and more flexible product licenses. This transition requires considerable investment in technical, financial, legal, and sales resources, and market acceptance is affected by factors including security, reliability, and performance. We are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects, which reflects our commitment to enhancing IT capabilities. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, as we believe this will help us meet evolving customer needs and market demands. We are continually investing resources to update and improve our information technology systems, which are critical for our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting, and financial reporting activities. The successful implementation of hardware or software updates is essential to avoid disruptions in our business operations. Our business model transition to cloud and mobile platforms entails both technological and business model shifts, which are necessary to remain competitive in the software industry. We believe that customer adoption of our new offerings will continue to grow as they take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services. Our ability to effectively distribute our products depends on the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network, which is crucial for maintaining our revenue streams. We rely significantly on major distributors and resellers, and any disruptions in these relationships could negatively impact our business. Additionally, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows, particularly given our substantial international operations. Our strategy depends on leveraging our global network of distributors, resellers, and partners to enhance our IT capabilities and drive growth. We recognize that our financial performance is closely tied to our ability to innovate and adapt to changes in technology and customer preferences. The transition to cloud-based services and flexible licensing models is expected to increase our long-term revenue growth rate by expanding our customer base and enhancing customer value. Our investments in research and development are aimed at ensuring we remain at the forefront of technological advancements and can meet the demands of our customers effectively. We are committed to managing our operational efficiency and maintaining rigorous cost controls while investing in the necessary technology and resources to support our strategic initiatives.

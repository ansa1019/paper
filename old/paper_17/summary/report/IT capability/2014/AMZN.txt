We face intense competition as our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, with many competitors in different industries, including retail, e-commerce services, digital content, and electronic devices. Some of our competitors may secure better terms from vendors and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Our expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks, including new and difficult technology challenges. Our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders is critical to our operational efficiency and market responsiveness. We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. We seek to efficiently invest in several areas of technology and content such as web services, expansion of new and existing product categories and offerings, and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of digital products and services. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We believe that advances in technology will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people's lives. Our international operations expose us to risks including limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure, which can affect our ability to manage growth effectively. We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate, which affects our investment decisions and operational flexibility. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory and completed orders to our customers, and any disruptions could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. Our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy customer demands is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate due to various factors, including the timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure. Our ability to optimize and operate our fulfillment and data centers is critical, as failure to do so could result in excess or insufficient capacity and increased costs. We must also manage our technology infrastructure effectively to prevent system interruptions and ensure efficient fulfillment of orders. Our reliance on third-party technology and systems for various functions, including encryption and authentication technology, requires robust IT governance and management skills to mitigate risks associated with data loss or security breaches. As we continue to expand our global operations, we must navigate complex regulatory environments that can impact our technology capabilities and operational strategies. Our investments in technology and infrastructure are aimed at enhancing customer experience and improving process efficiencies, which are vital for sustaining long-term growth and competitive positioning in the market.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including mandatory cyber security standards, may subject the traditional operating companies and southern power to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the subsidiaries are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions, including information technology system failure and cyber intrusion. The traditional operating companies and southern power face ongoing threats to their assets, including the potential for physical and cyber attacks against their respective generation facilities, transmission and distribution infrastructure, and information technology systems. If the traditional operating companies' or southern power's assets were to fail or be breached, they may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive data could be compromised, leading to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties. The implementation of technologies with which the Southern Company system is developing experience is critical for operational efficiency and competitive advantage. Changes in technology may make Southern Company's electric generating facilities less competitive, as distributed generation technologies could reduce the cost of producing power to a level that is competitive with traditional central station power production. The traditional operating companies' reliance on coal and natural gas for electric generation is influenced by market dynamics, including changes in power prices and fuel costs, which may reduce revenues and increase costs. The evolving landscape of digital technologies necessitates that Southern Company continuously assess its information management capability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and access. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is essential for transforming the firm into a competitive force. Additionally, the financial condition, net income, and cash flows of Southern Company could be adversely affected by changes in regulations related to transmission planning processes and competition in the wholesale electric markets. The Southern Company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant, and any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties and fines. The ultimate financial and operational impact of proposed regulations, such as those governing emissions, cannot be determined at this time and will depend on numerous known and unknown factors. The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy will be affected by the final requirements of new or revised environmental regulations, the time periods over which compliance is required, and the impact of future changes in generation and emissions-related technology and costs. The traditional operating companies and southern power may not be able to fully execute their business plans if market prices drop below original forecasts, impacting their ability to recover costs associated with new generation assets. The ongoing evolution of IT capabilities is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring the effective support of business needs amidst changing market conditions.

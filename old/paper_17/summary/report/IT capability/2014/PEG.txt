The following factors should be considered when reviewing our business, as they could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or net cash flows. We are subject to comprehensive and evolving regulation by federal, state, and local regulatory agencies that affects our businesses. Changes in regulation can cause significant delays in or materially affect business planning and transactions and can materially increase our costs. We may also require various regulatory approvals to engage in transactions and enter into financing arrangements. Compliance with regulatory requirements, including federal standards to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system, is critical. We have been, and will continue to be, periodically audited for compliance and are subject to penalties for non-compliance. Our operations are also influenced by commodity price volatility, which can affect our ability to meet supply obligations and impact liquidity needs. The energy market dynamics, including changes in load and demand, available generating capacity, and pricing mechanisms, can significantly impact our business performance. We face significant competition in the merchant energy markets, which may adversely affect our ability to make investments or sales on favorable terms. Our ability to successfully develop or construct generation, transmission, and distribution projects within budget is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and achieving our strategic objectives. Cybersecurity threats pose risks to our computing systems, which are critical for marketing generation output and managing fuel and power. The potential for cybersecurity attacks could disrupt operations and lead to significant costs for repair and remediation. Our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements, including the installation of required environmental upgrades and retrofits, and the construction of additional generation units and transmission facilities. We emphasize operational performance while developing opportunities in both our competitive and regulated businesses. Our financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive cash flow, and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. We utilize rigorous investment criteria when deploying capital and seek to invest in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain strong operational and financial performance in a cost-constrained environment, to capitalize on regulatory and legislative developments, and to respond to challenges such as regulatory uncertainty, changes in energy usage patterns, and evolving technologies. We focus on controlling costs while maintaining safety and reliability and complying with applicable standards and requirements. Our strategic initiatives include growing utility operations through continued investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects and maintaining a reliable generation fleet with the flexibility to utilize a diverse mix of fuels. The ability to balance energy obligations with available supply is critical, as generation output is subject to market risks that are beyond our control. We are also exposed to risks related to equipment failures, accidents, severe weather events, and other incidents that could impact our ability to provide safe and reliable service to our customers.

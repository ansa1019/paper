Ongoing changes in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, expose our business to significant risks, including the uncertainty of future growth rates and pricing trends that emphasize our customers' cost of ownership. The emergence of disruptive technologies impacts semiconductor manufacturing processes and the inspection and metrology requirements associated with such processes. Our management monitors trends such as the increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities, which influences our customers' investment decisions, and the bifurcation of the semiconductor manufacturing industry, which affects capital requirements. We face risks related to our highly concentrated customer base, where orders from a limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of our sales, increasing volatility tied to individual customers. Our ability to recognize revenue may be negatively impacted by customers' funding status, which can be weakened by adverse business conditions or corporate structure limitations. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry requires us to respond effectively to industry cycles, as our customers' capital spending patterns are influenced by factors like consumer demand and access to capital. Our success depends on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions, necessitating significant investments in research and development to enhance product performance and functionality. We rely on critical information systems for daily operations, and any disruptions could adversely affect our ability to process and report financial results. Our competitive advantage is linked to our ability to predict evolving industry standards and to develop new products that address changing customer needs. We engage in collaborative technology development efforts with customers and suppliers, which are essential for our ongoing technology and product research and development projects. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that maintain a competitive advantage in our marketplace. We must continue to make substantial investments in research and development to address yield challenges faced by our customers at future technology nodes. Our gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels and product mix, and we must effectively manage costs and drive productivity to respond to customer requirements. The complexity of our products exposes us to risks, including unexpected product performance issues that could incur significant costs and damage our reputation. Our management practices include balancing customer requirements with resource availability, which impacts our ability to recognize revenue. We have significant operations outside the United States, exposing us to risks related to managing global operations, including cultural diversity and compliance with local laws. Our strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are critical in navigating the dynamic semiconductor landscape, where technological advancements and market demands continuously evolve.

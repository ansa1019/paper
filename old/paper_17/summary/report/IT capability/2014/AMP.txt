Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including technological changes and events, which can materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of many of our businesses, and poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth. Our financial product solutions through our advisors include both our own products and services and the products of other companies, which allows us to address the evolving financial and retirement-related needs of our clients. We utilize two go-to-market approaches in carrying out our strategy: wealth management and asset management, which are centered on the long-term, personal relationships between our clients and our financial advisors. Our focus on personal relationships, together with our discipline in financial planning and strengths in product development and advice, allows us to maximize advisor productivity and client satisfaction. We have invested in and developed capabilities and tools designed to enhance our service delivery and operational efficiency. Our asset management capabilities are increasingly global in scale, and we provide a broad spectrum of investment advice and products to individual, institutional, and high-net-worth investors. The quality and breadth of our asset management capabilities are demonstrated by the performance of our mutual funds, which are rated by independent services. We believe our differentiated financial planning model, broad range of products and solutions, as well as our demonstrated financial strength throughout economic downturns, will help us capitalize on market opportunities. Our revenues are largely dependent upon the level and mix of assets we have under management and administration, which are subject to fluctuation based on market conditions and client activity. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent, and our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified people. Our businesses operate in intensely competitive industry segments, and we compete based on factors including service quality, investment performance, and perceived financial strength. Our operational systems and networks are subject to evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client information and damage to our reputation. We maintain security measures designed to protect against breaches of security and other interference with our systems and networks. We are reliant upon internal and third-party technology systems and networks to process, transmit, and store information, including sensitive client and proprietary information. Maintaining the integrity of these systems and networks is critical to our business operations. We routinely encounter and address cybersecurity threats, and any breaches could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and cash generated by our operations, and we believe the level of cash and securities we maintain is adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term obligations. The operational flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and achieving our strategic objectives. The ability to effectively manage risks associated with market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and operational challenges is crucial for our organizational performance and long-term sustainability.

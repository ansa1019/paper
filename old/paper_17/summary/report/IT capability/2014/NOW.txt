Our business could be harmed by any of these risks, including our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' requirements. We face cyber-security risks, including unauthorized use or disclosure of customer data, theft of proprietary information, and computer hacking attacks. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers' confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information, including personally identifiable information and protected health information. We do not control or monitor the information that customers process in our services, and we have legal and contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality and appropriate use of customer data. If we fail to grow our revenues sufficiently to keep pace with our growing investments and other expenses, our operating results will be harmed. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenues from existing customers depends on our ability to enhance our services and provide IT in a way that is broadly accepted. We need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in user expectations, including increased demand for intuitive and attractive user interfaces and security technologies. Our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the expanding needs of our customers as their use of our services grows. We expect the number of users and transactions we manage, the amount of data we transfer, process, and store, and the number of processes and systems we manage to continue to grow. In order to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue making significant investments to develop and implement new technologies in our services and cloud-based infrastructure operations. These technologies, which include databases, applications, and server optimizations, are often advanced, complex, new, and untested. We may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. We are also dependent upon open source and other third-party technologies and may be unable to quickly effect changes to such technologies, which may prevent us from rapidly responding to evolving customer requirements. Our business depends substantially on our existing customers purchasing additional subscriptions from us and renewing their subscriptions upon expiration of the subscription term. Our growth also depends in part on our ability to sell more subscriptions and additional professional services to our current customers. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, or fail to add more authorized users or fail to purchase additional professional services, our revenues may decline, and our operating results would be harmed. We face significant competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing, and managing software and internet-related solutions. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed. Our ability to enhance our existing service, develop new applications, and promote our services for the development of custom applications is critical. We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from subscriptions to our suite of applications for use within IT, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. We are expanding the breadth of our services to include offerings for service domains outside of IT and offerings for small and medium-sized businesses. The success of any enhancement or new application depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, introduction, and market acceptance. Our markets are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. We may acquire or invest in companies, which may divert our management's attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders.

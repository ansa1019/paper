Investing in AIG involves risk, and various factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Our businesses are highly dependent on the economic environment, both in the U.S. and globally, and extreme market events can lead to a lack of liquidity and highly volatile markets. Concerns beyond our control, such as uncertainty regarding the U.S. debt ceiling and fiscal policy, may adversely affect liquidity and lead to wider credit spreads. Our businesses face intense competition, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled personnel needed to support our operations. We utilize computer systems to manage customer data and conduct necessary business functions, and any systems failures or outages could harm our ability to conduct business. Our systems have been subject to unauthorized access, and while we maintain cyber risk insurance, it may not cover all costs associated with data breaches. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our IT capabilities are essential for transforming our firm into a competitive force and supporting business needs.

Our liquidity risk management framework includes policies and monitoring tools to address liquidity events, ensuring sufficient cash can be generated to meet obligations. We regularly review and update the methods and assumptions used to determine loss reserve estimates and establish resulting reserves. The estimation of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses involves significant judgment, and we consider various factors, including economic conditions and changes in the legal environment.

The company utilizes a variety of information technology systems to manage and operate its businesses. Despite the implementation of extensive security measures, the company's information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber attacks, and other events. Security breaches or disruptions of these information technology systems could adversely affect the business, potentially resulting in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer, supplier, or employee information. The ability to defend and protect intellectual property rights is crucial to maintaining the company's competitive position, as these rights include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other confidential information. The company engages in acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating these businesses, which could affect the anticipated benefits of such transactions. The success of these acquisitions will depend on the ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired and to cooperate with strategic partners. The company's competitive strategy emphasizes delivering solutions to customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost, which is influenced by technological changes and shifts in customer demand. The company faces competitive pressures that could affect prices or demand for its products, impacting sales or profit margins. Its operating results depend in part on the successful research, development, and marketing of new and/or improved products and services. The company is subject to various risks, including disruptions in production facilities located outside the United States, which could lead to delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue. Furthermore, the company monitors market prices of commodities and attempts to reduce price exposure through hedging activities, although significant shortages or price increases could adversely impact competitive positions. The company's operations are also affected by economic risks associated with international sales, including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies. Access to funding through capital markets is essential for executing the business plan, and any inability to maintain such access could materially adversely affect business and financial results. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support and enhance business strategies and work processes. The evolving scope of IT capabilities encompasses the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships, which is critical for transforming the firm into a competitive force. The ability to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is integral to meeting changing business needs and directions. The company's IT capabilities represent the application of both physical and intangible IT resources, including technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and human resources, to further organizational goals and enhance operational efficiency.

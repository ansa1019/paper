Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers. Weak global economic conditions or a reduction in information technology spending could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations in various ways, including longer sales cycles and lower prices for our products and services. Our reliance on revenue from Fortiguard security subscription and Forticare technical support services, which may decline, complicates our financial forecasting as downturns in sales are not immediately reflected in our operating results. We rely heavily on information technology systems to manage critical functions such as order processing, revenue recognition, financial forecasts, inventory, and supply chain management. Our systems may have a higher risk of failure or not receive the same level of support as those purchased from external technology companies. A significant interruption in our email service or other systems could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue. To manage future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and controls. Our failure to improve these systems may result in our inability to manage business growth and accurately forecast revenue, expenses, and earnings. We have been slow to adopt and implement certain automated functions, which could negatively impact our business. Our channel partners are critical to our revenue generation, and if they fail to perform, our ability to sell our products and services will be limited. We depend on our channel partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process. The loss of one or more significant channel partners could harm our operating results. We face intense competition in our market, and our competitors may have greater resources and capabilities, which could hinder our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position. The network security market is rapidly evolving, and we must accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing end-customer needs. Our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services, and our failure to offer high-quality technical support would adversely affect our sales and results of operations. We must continue to invest in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position and drive market share gains. Our business model relies on a distribution model where we primarily sell our products and services through distributors who sell to resellers and service providers. Our revenue recognition practices involve recognizing product revenue upon shipment and deferring revenue for services over the service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance closely as it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. Our operating expenses consist primarily of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, with personnel costs being the most significant component. We expect to continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts to capture additional market share, particularly in the enterprise market.

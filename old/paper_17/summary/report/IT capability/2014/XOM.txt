ExxonMobil's ability to operate efficiently, including managing expenses and improving production yields, is an important component of its competitive performance, which requires continuous management focus, technology improvements, cost control, productivity enhancements, and regular reappraisal of its asset portfolio. The company's research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment to maintain its competitive position, especially given the technological nature of its businesses and the need for continuous efficiency improvement. The success of ExxonMobil's upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects that require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors affecting the performance of major projects include the ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, and customers; model and optimize reservoir performance; and manage changes in operating conditions and costs. The company emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support business needs. The management of cybersecurity risks is also critical, as insufficient protection could lead to compromised business systems, altered or lost proprietary information, or disrupted business operations. ExxonMobil's operational efficiency is further enhanced by its rigorous management systems and continuous focus on minimizing risks associated with oil, gas, and petrochemical operations. The company is also implementing cost-effective new technologies and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, addressing both government requirements and community priorities. The ability to mitigate adverse impacts from severe weather events, natural disasters, and human error relies on effective disaster preparedness and response planning, as well as business continuity planning. The management effectiveness of co-venturers in projects where ExxonMobil is not the operator is also a factor that can influence performance. Overall, the coordination of technology resources and the strategic management of operational capabilities are essential for ExxonMobil to navigate the complexities of the global oil, gas, and petrochemical markets while maintaining a competitive edge.

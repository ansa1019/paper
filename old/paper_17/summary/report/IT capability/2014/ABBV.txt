Abbvie has and will continue to incur additional ongoing operating expenses to operate as an independent company, including the cost of various corporate headquarters functions, incremental information technology-related costs, and incremental costs to operate a stand-alone back office infrastructure outside the United States. Abbvie's transition services agreements with Abbott in the United States cover certain corporate support services that Abbvie has historically received from Abbott. Such services include information technology, accounts payable, payroll, and other financial functions, as well as engineering support for various facilities, quality assurance support, and other administrative services. These agreements facilitate the separation by allowing Abbvie to operate independently prior to establishing stand-alone back office functions across its organization. The company is also focused on enhancing its pipeline through licensing and collaboration activities, which are integral to its operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. Abbvie's strategy has emphasized delivering strong financial results and returns for shareholders while ensuring a sustainable growth business over the longer term, which necessitates effective management of its information technology resources. The company expects to achieve operating margin improvements while continuing to invest in its pipeline in support of opportunities in oncology, HCV, and immunology, as well as continued investment in key products. The transition from Abbott has involved the phased global implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system, related technology infrastructure, and transaction processing services to replace the information technology infrastructure and transactional services provided to Abbvie by Abbott. This transition is expected to be completed in 2015 and will include modifications to the design and operation of controls over financial reporting. Abbvie's management has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, which includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company. The company utilizes various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it, and where possible, works with organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts. Abbvie believes its systems and calculations for managing information technology resources are reliable. The company is also engaged in strategic licensing and partnering activities to augment its pipeline, which is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and operational flexibility in the biopharmaceutical sector. The focus on research and development continues to be a key strategic priority for Abbvie, as its long-term success depends on its ability to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and collaborate on compounds currently in development. The company has recorded significant expenses related to research and development collaborations, which are essential for advancing its technological capabilities and enhancing its market positioning. Abbvie's financial performance reflects the impact of its strategic investments in information technology and operational processes, which are designed to support its business objectives and enhance its overall effectiveness in the competitive landscape.

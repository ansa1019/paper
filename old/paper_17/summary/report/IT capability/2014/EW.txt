The company is committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care, which underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Our ability to compete will depend in large part on our ability to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technology advances, and keep pace with other developers of cardiovascular therapies and technologies. We face intense competition, and if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed. The medical device industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve, with success measured by the development of innovative products and the value brought to stakeholders. Our focus on innovation and a robust product pipeline will continue to help us compete more effectively, sustain our successes, and build long-term value for our shareholders. We are dedicated to generating robust clinical and economic evidence increasingly expected by patients, clinicians, and payors in the new healthcare environment, with the goal of enhancing the value of delivering comprehensive care. Our sales growth was driven by our transcatheter heart valve therapy products, which benefited from the launch of the edwards sapien 3 transcatheter heart valve, and in the United States, benefited from the launch of the edwards sapien xt transcatheter heart valve. The gross profit margin was negatively impacted by higher performance-based incentive compensation due to strong performance and higher manufacturing costs. We invested 14.9% of our net sales in research and development to strengthen our leadership and enable future growth opportunities. The increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to new aortic and mitral transcatheter heart valve therapy product development efforts, additional investments in clinical studies, and higher performance-based incentive compensation. We incurred external legal costs related to intellectual property litigation, reflecting the challenges in protecting our proprietary intellectual property, which is critical for maintaining our competitive position. Our intellectual property, other proprietary technology, and sensitive company information are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage, or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data, or misuse of IT by those with permitted access. The company relies on a combination of patents and trade secrets to protect its proprietary intellectual property and has invested significant resources to enforce these rights. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is crucial for ensuring the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with regulatory requirements. We have a five-year credit agreement providing up to an aggregate of $750.0 million in borrowings, which is essential for funding our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations that could result in substantial costs, impacting our ability to deploy resources effectively. The company's management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalties have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from uncertain tax positions, which reflects the complexities of managing compliance in a dynamic regulatory context.

The industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict, with business cycles that can vary by reportable segment and are influenced by customers' requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. To meet rapidly changing demand, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across multiple segments, which may incur unexpected costs to align operations. The company is exposed to risks associated with uncertain global economic conditions, which can affect customer purchasing decisions and consequently impact Applied's net sales and backlog. The semiconductor, flat panel display, and solar industries are characterized by ongoing changes that impact demand and profitability, including the increasing importance of establishing and maintaining strong customer relationships and the complexities of moving from product design to volume manufacturing. Applied must continually innovate and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes. The companyâ€™s future success depends on its ability to commercialize its equipment and services effectively while enhancing its operational performance. Applied's strategic priorities include growing its presence in wafer fab and display equipment and services, improving profitability in solar, and expanding its overall available market. The company is also focused on enhancing its worldwide operations to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, and achieve cost efficiencies. The development and support of a broadening set of products in diverse competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive, necessitating effective resource allocation among products and between the development of new products and enhancements of existing products. Applied's ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is vital to its success, as these individuals are essential for executing global strategies and maintaining a culture of innovation. The company has implemented a distributed manufacturing model and outsources various functions, including information technology support, which requires changes to existing operations and new procedures to realize potential productivity and operational efficiencies. Applied is also implementing a multi-year program to transform certain business processes, including enhancements to enterprise resource planning systems, which entails risks associated with changes in business processes that could disrupt operations. The company must effectively manage its technology infrastructure and ensure that its IT capabilities support business needs, including the timely delivery of parts and components from suppliers. Additionally, Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats, as it collects, uses, transmits, and stores data on information technology systems, including confidential information belonging to the company and its customers. The effectiveness of its IT governance and the ability to protect its intellectual property rights are crucial for maintaining competitive advantages in the market.

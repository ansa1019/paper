Information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The focus on information management capability highlights the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored in response to changing business needs and directions. Mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is crucial for transforming a firm into a competitive force. The application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources further supports organizational goals. The company’s operations are subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of customers, impacting demand for products and services. The global pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption that impacts business operations and financial results. The company has taken actions to secure liquidity in light of the uncertainty in economic conditions, including raising significant amounts through senior note offerings. The management of the impact of COVID-19 requires significant investment of time and resources, which may divert or delay the application of resources toward new initiatives or investments. The company’s IT systems support various business processes and activities, and disruptions to this infrastructure could interfere with operations, interrupt production and shipments, and damage customer and business partner relationships. The company seeks to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate cybersecurity threats, which include identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, and continuous monitoring of IT networks and systems. The development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks, particularly with the increasing number of products delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. The company has developed product software designs believed to be less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but vulnerabilities remain. The company collects, stores, and processes confidential or sensitive data, and despite efforts to protect such data, it may be vulnerable to material security breaches. The company’s strategic resource allocation and investment decisions are influenced by the need for operational flexibility and the ability to respond to market dynamics. The company’s management practices and strategic decisions are critical in navigating the challenges posed by environmental factors and regulatory contexts, which can impact business performance and market positioning. The company’s ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products is essential for maintaining competitive advantage in increasingly competitive markets.

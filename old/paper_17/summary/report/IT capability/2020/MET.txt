The company's IT capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is emphasized. The management of investment portfolio and hedging market risks with derivatives is integral to the company's strategy, focusing on cash flow and duration to support current and future liabilities. The investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, which are generally well-suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. The company actively evaluates market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions. The ability to adapt to changes in the competitive environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is a significant differentiator for success in the life insurance industry and the broader financial services industry. The company has implemented risk management and business continuity plans, which have enabled it to maintain critical business processes, customer service levels, and financial reporting systems. The ongoing evaluation of technology resources and capabilities is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. The company’s risk management policies and procedures may not be sufficiently comprehensive to identify and protect against every risk, particularly in the context of increased operational and cybersecurity risks due to extended remote work periods. The assumptions and data on which risk management models are based may be inaccurate, and the models may not fully predict future exposures or accurately reflect past experience. The company’s IT governance framework is designed to ensure that technology management aligns with organizational goals and regulatory requirements. The integration of technology capabilities into business processes is essential for maintaining competitive positioning and achieving market-based performance. The company’s strategic resource allocation includes investments in digital technologies and innovation partnerships to enhance its market agility and responsiveness to consumer demands. The management of operational flexibility and resource deployment is critical for navigating market dynamics and external influences. The continuous monitoring of investment performance and the effectiveness of technology deployment are vital for achieving performance gains and ensuring compliance with regulatory contexts. The company’s commitment to enhancing its IT infrastructure and capabilities reflects its focus on business transformation and value creation.

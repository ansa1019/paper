The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we face many competitors across geographies and industries, including e-commerce and omnichannel retail. Some competitors may secure better terms from vendors and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, and marketing. Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and enhanced technologies, which increases our competition. Our expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional risks, including limited experience in newer market segments and potential claims from customers experiencing service disruptions or failures. Our international operations expose us to risks such as local economic and political conditions, government regulation, and compliance with laws regarding privacy and data protection. The complexity of our business can place significant strain on our management, operations, systems, and internal controls. We experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate, which depend on our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and manage inventory. Our ability to optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers is critical, as failures in this area can result in excess or insufficient capacity and increased costs. We face risks related to system interruptions and lack of redundancy, which can adversely affect our operating results. Our technology and content costs reflect investments made to enhance customer experience and improve process efficiencies. We seek to invest efficiently in technology infrastructure to support our operations and service offerings. Our technology investments are expected to increase over time as we add employees and infrastructure. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified many of these risks, affecting our fulfillment network capacity and supply chain constraints. We believe that advances in technology, specifically in processing power, data storage, and analytics, will continue to improve user experience and increase the ubiquity of the internet. We also rely on third-party technology and systems for various functions, and failures in these systems could expose us to risks of data loss or security breaches. Our ability to manage growth effectively is crucial, as failure to do so could damage our reputation and limit our growth. We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, and invest in complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies. The variability in our retail business places increased strain on our operations, and our failure to stock or restock popular products could significantly affect our revenue and future growth. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory and completed orders, and disruptions in these services could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience.

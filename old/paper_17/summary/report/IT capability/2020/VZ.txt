Verizon's strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, provide additional capacity for growth in networks, evolve and maintain networks, and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. The company believes that steady and consistent investments in networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel growth. Verizon is focused on leveraging its network leadership to drive growth based on delivering what customers want in the new digital world. The deployment of the 5G network is subject to various risks, including equipment and spectrum availability, unexpected costs, and regulatory permitting requirements that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. The company expects that its next-generation multi-use platform, the intelligent edge network, will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology, and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-efficient manner. The intelligent edge network is expected to improve efficiency and virtualization, increase automation, and support edge computing services that will enhance both fiber-based and radio access network technologies. Verizon's business operations are subject to interruption by various risks, including cyber attacks that could adversely affect its ability to operate networks and systems. The company has implemented measures to protect its infrastructure and operations from the impacts of such events. The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, with significant competition from traditional and non-traditional participants seeking increased market share. Verizon's ability to compete effectively will depend on its network quality, capacity, coverage, pricing of products and services, and the quality of customer service. The company expects future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customers shift to higher access plans and from increased connections per account. Verizon is focused on expanding its existing services offered to business customers through its intelligent edge network. The company anticipates that its investments aimed at expanding its portfolio of products and services will provide customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy. The business excellence initiatives are expected to drive cost savings and create incremental growth opportunities, particularly in areas such as 5G and fiber. Verizon's capital expenditures are primarily directed towards increasing operating efficiency and productivity of networks, maintaining existing infrastructure, and facilitating the introduction of new products and services. The company is also focused on enhancing responsiveness to competitive challenges through its investments in advanced technologies and network capabilities. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected Verizon's operations, and the company has taken various actions to care for its employees and keep customers connected during this time. The ability to adapt to future changes in technology and enhance existing offerings is crucial for maintaining competitiveness in the rapidly changing telecommunications landscape.

We rely extensively on information and operational technology ("IT/OT") systems, networks, and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems, and other hardware, software, and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided, and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT/OT systems, networks, and services include ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, summarizing and reporting results of operations, managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms, hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans, and financial information, collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, providing data security, and handling other processes necessary to manage our business. Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks, and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers' IT/OT databases or systems. Our IT/OT databases and systems and our third-party providers' databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking, and other cyber-attacks. If the IT/OT systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial, and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. We also upgrade our IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies periodically. If such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, and discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, have interrupted product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

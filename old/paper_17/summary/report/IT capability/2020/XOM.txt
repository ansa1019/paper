ExxonMobil's financial and operating results are subject to various risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses, including technological improvements in energy efficiency and the need for continuous efficiency improvement. The company relies on its ability to manage expenses and improve production yields, which requires ongoing management focus, including technology improvements and productivity enhancements. ExxonMobil's research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The company must continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to its businesses. Additionally, the effectiveness of management systems and controls is critical to minimizing risks associated with oil, gas, and petrochemical operations. Cybersecurity is a significant concern, with ExxonMobil regularly subject to attempted disruptions from various threat actors, necessitating multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection. The company's defensive preparedness includes non-technological measures such as threat information sharing and internal training campaigns. The ability to mitigate adverse impacts from severe weather events and natural disasters is also essential, as the effectiveness of facility engineering and disaster preparedness planning directly influences operational continuity. Furthermore, the competitive landscape is shaped by technology and expertise provided by industry service companies, which may enhance the competitiveness of firms lacking internal resources. ExxonMobil's reputation is an important corporate asset that can be affected by operational incidents or significant cybersecurity disruptions, impacting the company's ability to compete for new opportunities and obtain necessary regulatory approvals. The long-term success of ExxonMobil's upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects that require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. The ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, and customers is critical to managing changes in operating conditions and costs. The company's operational efficiency is a key component of competitive performance, necessitating continuous management focus on technology improvements and regular reappraisal of the asset portfolio. The management of overall project portfolios, including diversification among types and locations of projects, is vital for mitigating risk and providing attractive returns to shareholders. ExxonMobil's operations are also influenced by external economic and political factors, including changes in interest rates, inflation, and regulatory developments affecting operations. The company faces competition from both private firms and state-owned companies, which may pursue opportunities with less focus on financial returns. The ability to adapt and apply the strengths of the current business model to provide future energy products in a cost-competitive manner is essential for ExxonMobil's future results.

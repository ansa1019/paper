The business is highly dependent on our ability to access critical technology systems to perform necessary functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, and managing investment portfolios. Our operations may be significantly disrupted if our critical workforce, key vendors, or third-party providers are unable to work effectively, including due to illness or government actions in response to crises such as COVID-19. We are exposed to risks if we are unable to maintain the availability of our critical technology systems and data and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of our data, which could compromise our ability to conduct business and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The systems we maintain and third-party systems we use have been and will likely continue to be targets of unauthorized access and cyber threats. We must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to mitigate the risk of threats to our data and systems. Our reliance on technology has increased, especially during the transition to remote work environments due to COVID-19, which has heightened operational risks, including cybersecurity threats. The operational risk management framework includes identifying, assessing, measuring, managing, and monitoring operational risk exposures, which are integral to our business processes. We leverage technological advancements and innovation to enhance customer experiences and operational efficiency, focusing on digital capabilities and data analytics. Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each operating unit, targeting an asset allocation mix that supports estimated cash flows of our outstanding liabilities and provides diversification. The primary objectives are the generation of investment income, preservation of capital, and liquidity management. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management, including spread management strategies for our investment-oriented products. Our risk management framework includes a comprehensive cash flow projection process that incorporates all relevant liquidity sources and uses, including known and likely cash inflows and outflows. We utilize various risk management tools, including scenario analysis and stress testing, to assess the impact of adverse market conditions on our liquidity and capital resources. The liquidity risk management framework is designed to ensure that sufficient cash will be available to meet obligations as they come due under both normal and stressed conditions. We maintain a committed, revolving syndicated credit facility as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. Our insurance companies have significant liquidity in the form of cash and short-term investments, and we expect them to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements through cash from operations and monetization of invested assets. Our technology infrastructure is critical to our operations, and we continuously evaluate and enhance our systems to improve operational effectiveness and support business transformation initiatives.

Our business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. The various uses of these IT systems, networks, and services include, but are not limited to, controlling our pipelines and terminals with industrial control systems, collecting and storing information and data, processing transactions, and handling other processing necessary to manage our business. We have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our IT and data systems from such attacks, but we can provide no assurance that our cybersecurity program will be effective. The risk of a disruption or breach of our operational systems, or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations, through an act of terrorism or cyber sabotage event has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly, or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. A significant failure, compromise, breach, or interruption in our systems could result in a disruption of our operations, customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, and a loss of customers or revenues. We have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization. The occurrence of an attack could cause a substantial decrease in revenues and cash flows, increased costs to respond, or other financial loss, damage to our reputation, increased regulation or litigation, or inaccurate information reported from our operations. Our business is also dependent on the supply of and demand for the products that we handle, and we face competition from other pipelines and terminals, as well as other forms of transportation and storage. Competition is a factor affecting our existing businesses and our ability to secure new project opportunities. Our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion and new-build projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining, or our inability to obtain, permits and rights-of-way, as well as public opposition, increases in costs of construction materials, cost overruns, inclement weather, and other delays. We cannot predict the impact of future economic conditions, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, governmental regulation, or technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices, all of which could reduce the production of and/or demand for the products we handle. Our operations and management require the retention and recruitment of a skilled workforce, including engineers, technical personnel, and other professionals. We compete with other companies in the energy industry for this skilled workforce. If we are unable to retain current employees, successfully complete the knowledge transfer, and recruit new employees of comparable knowledge and experience, our business could be negatively impacted. The development of crude oil and gas properties involves risks that may result in a total loss of investment. The business of developing and operating oil and gas properties involves a high degree of business and financial risk that even a combination of experience, knowledge, and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. A breach of information security or failure of one or more key information technology or operational systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, or business reputation.

The utility's electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events and malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks. The utility's operational networks may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the utility's operational networks could significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the utility's ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas, or otherwise operate efficiently. The utility relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store, and process sensitive information, including financial information, customer energy usage, and billing information. The utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and to provide other services. The utility has been subject to breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to its information technology systems or confidential data, which could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. The utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents; however, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at reasonable rates or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance. The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which could materially affect the utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. The utility's ability to earn its authorized return on equity depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. The utility's ability to recover costs associated with wildfire mitigation and other activities is subject to regulatory review and approval. The utility's financial results may be impacted by the timing and outcome of its regulatory proceedings, including those related to wildfire mitigation, safety culture, and cost recovery mechanisms. The utility's operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and orders, which could expose the utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. The utility's ability to recover costs, including its investments associated with legislative and regulatory initiatives, will depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and the associated ratemaking mechanisms. The utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if it is unable to timely recover costs in connection with wildfire-related claims, regulatory compliance, and other operational expenditures. The utility's management practices, including its information management and record-keeping systems, are critical to ensuring compliance with safety and regulatory standards, and any deficiencies in these areas could lead to significant liabilities and reputational harm.

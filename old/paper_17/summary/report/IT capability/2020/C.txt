Citi's expenses reflected continued investments in its transformation, including infrastructure supporting its risk and control environment. The company is embarking on a multiyear transformation, targeting changes to its business and operating models that strengthen risk and controls while improving value to customers, clients, and shareholders. This transformation includes compliance with the federal reserve board and OCC consent orders, which require acceptable plans relating to risk management, compliance, data quality management, governance, and internal controls. Citi's strategy is to leverage its global footprint and digital capabilities to develop multi-product relationships with customers, optimizing client experiences across lending, payments, and wealth management through continued digitization, new partnerships, and innovation. The institutional clients group (ICG) includes banking and markets and securities services, providing a full range of wholesale banking products and services, including corporate lending, investment banking, and advisory services. ICG's revenue is generated primarily from fees and spreads associated with these activities, and it transacts with clients in both cash instruments and derivatives. The management of the markets businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of market conditions, which significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads, and the fair value of product inventory. The increase in net credit losses was largely driven by write-offs across various sectors, reflecting the impact of the pandemic across multiple sectors, as well as downgrades in the corporate portfolios. The reserve build included an increase in the qualitative management adjustment to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and a slower economic recovery. Citi's organizational response to the pandemic has been governed by its executive management team, focusing on managing pandemic responses, implementing continuity of business plans, and addressing customer and client needs. The company has centralized its program management under a chief administrative officer organization to strengthen its risk and control environment. As of December 31, 2020, Citi had a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.7%, reflecting its strong capital and liquidity positions. The economic outlook for 2021 reflects continued challenges and uncertainties related to the pandemic, which have created a more volatile operating environment that will continue to negatively impact Citi's businesses and results. The company expects to incur higher expenses as it accelerates the transformation of its infrastructure, risk management, and controls, including efforts to comply with the consent orders. The builds to its allowance for credit losses (ACL) during 2020 were driven by a deterioration in Citi's macroeconomic outlook under the CECL standard, reflecting the impact of the pandemic. The increase in provisions for credit losses was primarily driven by a higher allowance for credit losses build, partially offset by lower net credit losses. The ACL build was driven by builds during the first half of 2020, reflecting the impact of a deterioration in Citi's macroeconomic outlook.

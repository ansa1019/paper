As a large global health service company operating in a complex industry, we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition, or the trading price of our securities. Future performance will depend on our ability to execute strategic and operational initiatives effectively, including differentiating our products and services, developing data and analytic solutions, and managing relationships with clients and partners. Our strategic initiatives require effective collaboration across operations, integration of acquired businesses, and the ability to respond rapidly to competitive, economic, and regulatory changes. The health service industry is dynamic and rapidly evolving, with significant shifts in structure potentially altering industry dynamics and affecting our ability to attract or retain clients. We must adapt to technological changes, including the increasing use of telehealth, and manage the impacts of legislation and regulatory changes on our operations. Our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to, and maintain the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology systems is critical to our success. We rely on maintaining effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our customers and health care providers.

We face risks related to cybersecurity threats, including unauthorized access and data breaches, which could expose sensitive personal information and harm our reputation. Additionally, we must comply with various privacy, security, and data laws, which are increasingly stringent and could impact our operations and costs. Our business model requires us to leverage technology capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and support strategic resource allocation. The integration of technology into our operations is vital for achieving competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics.

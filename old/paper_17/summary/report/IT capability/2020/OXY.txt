Occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems, related infrastructure, technologies, and networks to run its business and to control and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, marketing, and pipeline operations. The oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. Cyber attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years, and information and industrial control technology system failures, network disruptions, and breaches of data security could disrupt operations by causing delays, impeding processing of transactions, and reporting financial results. A cyber attack involving information or industrial control systems could negatively impact operations in various ways, including unauthorized access to sensitive information, data corruption, and operational disruptions. Occidental has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of a cyber attack, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches. The company continues to enhance its cyber security measures and investigate vulnerabilities, which may increase costs. Occidental's operations and financial results could be significantly negatively impacted by its offshore operations, which are vulnerable to unique risks associated with operating offshore, including compliance with environmental, safety, and other laws and regulations. The company’s ability to successfully execute new business strategies effectively is critical, and its strategies are subject to business, economic, and competitive uncertainties. Occidental’s operations benefit from scale, technical expertise, and commercial and governmental collaboration, allowing the company to bring additional production quickly to market and provide low-cost returns-driven growth opportunities with advanced technology. The oil and gas segment focuses on long-term value creation and leadership in sustainability, health, safety, and the environment, striving to achieve low development and operating costs to maximize the full-cycle value of its assets. Occidental aims to maximize shareholder returns through efficient capital allocation and deployment, prioritizing projects that decrease its carbon footprint. The company is committed to implementing innovative carbon management and storage solutions for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Occidental's investment choices are influenced by the need to enhance operational efficiency and ensure that technology capabilities align with business strategies. The company’s management practices include evaluating the effectiveness of technology deployment and ensuring that operational flexibility is maintained in response to market dynamics. Occidental’s strategic resource allocation is designed to leverage its IT capabilities in support of business needs, enhancing its competitive advantage and market responsiveness.

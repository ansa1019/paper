AEP's performance is highly dependent on the successful operation of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, which involves many risks, including information technology failure that impairs AEP's information technology infrastructure or disrupts normal business operations. AEP and its regulated utility businesses face physical security and cybersecurity risks as the owner-operators of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, which are dependent on information technology systems. The computer systems that run these facilities are not completely isolated from external networks, making them potential targets for cyber-attacks. A successful cyber-attack could severely disrupt business operations, preventing service to customers or collection of revenues, and could lead to significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage. Additionally, the breach of certain business systems could affect the ability to correctly record, process, and report financial information. AEP's management believes that the company's experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives it an advantage over other competitors in securing authorization to install, construct, and operate new transmission lines and facilities. However, there can be no assurance that regulatory bodies will authorize new transmission projects or will award such projects to AEP. AEP's transmission investment strategy and execution are dependent on federal and state regulatory policy, and a significant portion of AEP's earnings is derived from transmission investments and activities. The ability to recover costs associated with the operation of nuclear generation facilities is also subject to uncertainties with respect to technological and financial aspects, which could impact AEP's financial condition. Furthermore, AEP's reliance on access to capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows underscores the importance of effective resource allocation and management capability in supporting business strategies. Changes in technology and regulatory policies may lower the value of electric utility facilities and franchises, challenging AEP's competitive ability to maintain relatively low-cost, efficient, and reliable operations. AEP's financial performance may be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully operate facilities or perform certain corporate functions, including compliance with mandatory reliability standards, which may subject AEP to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. The company's ability to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce is critical, as failure to do so could harm results of operations. AEP's business plan for the construction of new projects involves risks, including the potential for significant cancellation penalties and the inability to recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. The interconnected nature of AEP's operations with external relationships and regulatory frameworks emphasizes the need for effective information management and strategic alignment to navigate market dynamics and ensure operational efficiency.

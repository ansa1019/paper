BlackRock's investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of assets under management (AUM) and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. The investment management industry is highly competitive, and BlackRock competes based on various factors including investment performance, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution, and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock's competitive success. Aladdin's competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading, and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers may weaken Aladdin's competitive position and may cause the company's revenue and earnings to decline. The company's financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands, and develop, market, and manage new investment products and services. BlackRock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients, and operate efficiently. The company leverages its world-class risk management, analytics, and technology capabilities, including the Aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. BlackRock's Aladdin platform provides clients with the ability to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. The company has been deepening the integration of sustainability into technology, risk management, and product choice across BlackRock, and plans to accelerate those efforts. The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock's performance. BlackRock's ability to maintain Aladdin's competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock's productivity and growth. The introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers. BlackRock's infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. A failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock's operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the company's reputation, and cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline. BlackRock's decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline. The company must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. Continuing enhancements to Aladdin's capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin's processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks.

As a financial services company, we are subject to risks related to the use of technology which is critical to our ability to maintain or enhance the competitiveness of our businesses and is dependent on having the right to use the underlying intellectual property. We rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record and monitor our transactions and those of our customers. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our ability to succeed is dependent on the technologies we employ and offer our customers and the extent to which we at least keep pace with, if not exceed, our competitors' progress and our customers' needs and expectations. We have been investing in technology and connectivity, seeking to automate functions previously performed manually, facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions, and enhance the customer experience with respect to our products and services. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to technology would likely cause us to lose market share or incur additional expense. Our use of technology is dependent on having the right to use the underlying intellectual property. We could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of our information systems and other technology. The need to ensure proper functioning and resiliency of our information systems and other technology has become more important and more challenging. We are vulnerable to the impact of failures of our systems to operate as needed or intended, including those resulting from human error, unexpected transaction volumes, or overall design or performance issues. We also rely on information systems maintained by other companies, which could have a negative impact on us. We maintain and process vast amounts of information about us, our customers, and our employees. The ability to conduct business with us in an electronic manner depends on the transmission and storage of confidential information. Efforts by bad actors to engage in various types of cyber attacks pose serious risks to our business and reputation. We have policies, procedures, and systems designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions, or breaches in security of information systems. Our cyber security program is designed to identify risks to sensitive information, protect that information, detect threats and events, and maintain an appropriate response and recovery capability. We have established an enterprise LIBOR transition program to address the risks associated with the planned discontinuance of LIBOR, which includes enhancing fallback language in new contracts and reviewing existing legal contracts. We are actively monitoring PNC's overall firm-wide exposure to LIBOR and using these results to plan transitional strategies. Our ability to manage operational risk is embedded in our culture and decision-making processes through a systematic approach whereby operational risks and exposures are identified and assessed, managed through the design and implementation of controls, measured and evaluated against our risk tolerance limits, and appropriately reported to management and the risk committee. We utilize operational risk management programs to assess existing risks, determine potential/emerging risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. Our risk management framework includes technology and systems risk associated with the use, operation, and adoption of technology, ensuring that we are equipped to manage the risks inherent in our operations.

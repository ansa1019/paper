The rapid development of new technologies, services, and products has eliminated many traditional distinctions among communication services and brought new competitors to the market, necessitating effective competition strategies. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our network quality, capacity, and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, and our development of new and enhanced products and services. The deployment of our 5G network is subject to various risks, including equipment availability and regulatory permitting requirements that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. If we are unable to respond successfully to competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. We must adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our customers' changing demands. The inability to operate or use our networks and systems as a result of cyber attacks could result in significant expenses and a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack could include increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and lost revenues from business interruption. Our presence in the IoT industry increases our exposure to potential costs and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent cyber attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating. We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment and services necessary for our operations, and any failure to deliver on their part could disrupt our ability to maintain or upgrade our networks. The costs and time associated with transitioning from one supplier to another could substantially disrupt our business. We face significant competition that may reduce our profits, and if we are unable to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services. Our industries are rapidly changing, and we must phase out outdated technologies while introducing new offerings. Adverse economic conditions could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for our products and services, impacting our results of operations. Changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects. We are subject to federal, state, and international laws related to privacy and data protection, which could have a significant impact on our businesses. The further regulation of broadband and wireless activities could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return on past and future investments in our networks. We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. Our significant debt could have negative consequences, including reducing the funds available for other purposes and making it more difficult to obtain necessary future financing. We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business, and adverse changes in credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and affect our access to financing. In addition, increases in costs for pension benefits and healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.

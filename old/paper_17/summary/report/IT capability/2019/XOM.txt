ExxonMobil's future business results depend on its ability to manage factors that are at least in part within its control, including operational efficiency, which is a crucial component of competitive performance. This efficiency requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost control, and productivity enhancements. The company emphasizes the need for its research and development organizations to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To remain competitive, ExxonMobil must continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies, successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to its businesses. The company faces competition not only from other private firms but also from state-owned companies that may pursue opportunities with less focus on financial returns than companies owned by private shareholders. The operational and financial performance of ExxonMobil is also influenced by its ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, and customers, which requires effective management and strategic resource allocation. The company’s reputation, which is an important corporate asset, can be adversely affected by significant cybersecurity disruptions, operational incidents, or changes in consumer views concerning its products. Cybersecurity is a critical concern, as ExxonMobil is regularly subject to attempted disruptions from various threat actors, necessitating multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection. The company's defensive preparedness includes sharing threat information with governmental and industry groups, internal training, and an emphasis on business response and recovery. If cybersecurity measures prove insufficient, the company and its stakeholders could be adversely affected, leading to significant costs to remedy the effects of a major disruption. ExxonMobil's ability to operate efficiently and manage expenses is vital, particularly given the commodity-based nature of its businesses. The company must also continuously improve its ability to identify promising resource prospects and apply project management expertise to bring discovered resources online as scheduled and within budget. The long-term success of ExxonMobil's upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects that require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. The company’s operational flexibility and ability to manage its overall portfolio are essential for mitigating risk and providing attractive returns to shareholders. Additionally, the firm’s investment in research and development, particularly in new technologies, is crucial for maintaining its competitive position and adapting to market changes. The effectiveness of ExxonMobil's management systems and controls is critical in minimizing risks inherent in oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, while rigorous management systems focus on workplace safety and environmental risk management.

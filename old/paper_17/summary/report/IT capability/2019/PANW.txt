Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the effective management of our information technology and financial infrastructure, which is crucial for supporting our growth and operational efficiency. To manage future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings place a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. As we have grown, we have increasingly managed more complex deployments of our products and subscriptions with larger end-customers, which requires effective coordination throughout our organization. Our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and subscriptions to our existing end-customers is influenced by changes in end-customer requirements and market needs, which may affect our operational flexibility and market agility. We face intense competition in our market, and many of our existing competitors have substantial competitive advantages, including greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, and broader distribution networks. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing end-customers and create demand for our new offerings, including cloud security and AI and analytics offerings. We believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. The architecture of our platform offers superior performance compared to legacy approaches and reduces the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying their security operations and infrastructure. Our subscription and support revenue, which accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue, is expected to increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions and renew existing contracts. Our investments in research and development are critical for maintaining our competitive position, and we expect to continue to invest significantly in this area. We monitor our deferred revenue balance, as it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods, and we consider billings to be a key metric used by management to manage our business. Our ability to manage production and manufacturing-related costs, as well as global customer service organization costs, is essential for maintaining operational efficiency. Additionally, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that may require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reliance on manufacturing partners exposes us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance and product costs. We must also navigate the complexities of international operations, which may involve political, economic, and social uncertainties that could impact our business. The successful execution of our strategy to increase sales of our products and subscriptions to new and existing medium and large enterprise end-customers is critical for our future performance.

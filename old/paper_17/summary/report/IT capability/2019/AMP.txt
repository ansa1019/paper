Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including technological changes and events, which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. The profitability of our products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, which are influenced by market conditions and client activity. We believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of many of our businesses, and poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth. The market for financial advisors and portfolio managers is extremely competitive, and our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified people, which is critical for driving growth and results in our wealth management business. Our businesses operate in intensely competitive industry segments, and we compete based on various factors, including service quality, investment performance, and perceived financial strength. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and by economic, political, and other factors, including changes in consumer economic variables that could impact client activity across our businesses. 

We face risks arising from acquisitions and divestitures, including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our operations and control environment, which could hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits from such transactions. Our operational systems and networks are subject to evolving cybersecurity risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client or employee information, damage to our reputation, and additional costs. Maintaining the security and integrity of our information systems is critical to our business operations and the protection of sensitive data. We have implemented policies and security measures designed to protect against breaches of corporate security and other interference with our systems. However, we cannot assure that our systems will not be subject to successful attacks or breaches in the future.

Our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and cash generated by our operations. We believe the level of cash and securities we maintain is adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. However, disruptions or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit our access to capital required to operate our business, potentially impacting our ability to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. Our financial strength ratings are important to maintain public confidence in our products, and a downgrade in these ratings could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We also face risks associated with regulatory changes that may impact our operations and financial condition. The uncertain regulatory environment may lead to structural changes in the industry, and we may be required to adapt our business strategies accordingly. The impact of regulatory changes, including those related to fiduciary standards and data protection, may impose additional costs and operational challenges that could affect our ability to market our products and services effectively. Our ability to leverage technology capabilities and maintain operational efficiency is essential for achieving our strategic objectives and enhancing our competitive position in the market.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector involves competitors ranging from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms. The ability to remain competitive depends on success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Our business model includes creating platform-based ecosystems that generate beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider, which can accelerate growth. We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers, facing significant competition from platforms developed for new devices such as smartphones and tablets. Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases, influencing device purchasing decisions. Our strategic vision involves building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, infused with artificial intelligence. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies, and our success in the Internet of Things (IoT) will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings. The intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of IoT, which presents security, privacy, and execution risks. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks, and we must maintain the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services across a growing array of computing devices. The security of our products and services is critical to our customers' decisions to purchase or use them, and threats to our IT security can take various forms, including cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities. We must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security features, and provide security tools to protect the integrity of our network and services. Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, impacting operational efficiency and monetization opportunities. The growth of our internet- and cloud-based services relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries, with legal requirements evolving regarding the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs or reduced efficiency. Our ability to attract and retain talented employees is crucial for developing and delivering successful products and services, and we face challenges in recruiting due to competitive pressures and restrictive immigration laws. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining a diverse workforce, and maintaining our brand and reputation is essential for recruiting and retaining employees. The dynamic nature of our industry, characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving business models, necessitates continuous adaptation and innovation to meet changing customer demands and competitive forces.

The company relies heavily on computer systems to manage and operate its business, record and process transactions, and manage, support and communicate with its employees, customers, suppliers, and other vendors. Computer systems are important to production planning, manufacturing, finance, company operations, and customer service, among other business-critical processes. Despite efforts to prevent disruptions to its computer systems, the systems may be affected by damage or interruption from various causes, including power outages, system failures, computer viruses, and other intrusions, including ransomware and other cyber attacks. The company collects, processes, and retains sensitive and confidential personal information about its customers, employees, and suppliers, and any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information could result in losses, severely damage its reputation, expose it to litigation and liability, disrupt operations, and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition. The domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security, data collection, and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to the business. Compliance with these requirements could result in additional costs and changes to business practices. The company continues to increase its sensitivity and attention to cybersecurity threats, seeking additional investments and resources to address these threats and enhance the security of its facilities and systems. The company has made significant investments in information systems and increased compensation, including stock-based compensation, to support these systems. Additionally, the company has recognized that technology, product quality, product innovation, technical expertise, and service are key competitive factors in its business, and it faces substantial competition from many international, national, regional, and local competitors. Increased competition may reduce sales, earnings, or cash flow performance. The company’s ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control, and it is subject to various domestic and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including data privacy and security laws. The company has implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote continued compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, which may impose increasingly stringent requirements upon the company and the industry in the future. The company’s operations are also subject to various risks associated with information technology, including the potential for cybersecurity incidents that could disrupt operations and compromise sensitive information. The company is committed to enhancing its IT capabilities to support business needs and leverage technology resources effectively, ensuring operational efficiency and alignment with strategic objectives.

The company must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade its information technology systems, including protecting against internal and external cybersecurity threats. Information technology enables the company to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce financial statements. If the company does not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, it could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include malicious software, phishing, and attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, which could lead to disruptions in business systems and an inability to process customer orders. The company relies on relationships with third parties, including suppliers and distributors, for certain functions or for services in support of operations. These third-party service providers are subject to similar risks related to cybersecurity and business interruption. While the company has procedures in place for selecting and managing its relationships with third-party service providers, it does not have control over their business operations or governance systems, which increases financial, legal, reputational, and operational risk. The company believes it has adopted appropriate measures, including ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments, to mitigate potential risks to its technology and operations from these disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of such disruptions, the company could potentially be subject to operational interruption and damage to its brand image. If its data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data for the operation of the business, compliance with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the timeliness of reporting internal and external operating results. The company is subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal data. These laws are subject to change, and new personal data legislation may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time. The company must comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws, which may require costly changes to business practices and security systems. Failure to comply could result in adverse publicity, government enforcement actions, and/or private litigation, negatively impacting business and operating results. The company’s ability to achieve profitability from operations outside the United States is also a concern, as it faces substantial risks associated with foreign operations, including economic instability, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, and legal compliance challenges. The company’s growth strategy includes expanding its international business, which exposes it to risks inherent in conducting international operations. The ability to effectively manage inventories and accounts receivables is critical to maintaining operational efficiency and achieving business objectives. The company’s future success will depend, in part, upon its continued ability to develop and introduce innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, while also managing costs and maintaining effective relationships with distributors and retailers.

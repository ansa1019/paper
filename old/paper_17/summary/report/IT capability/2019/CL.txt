We rely extensively on information technology systems ("IT systems"), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to: communicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; receiving and processing orders from, shipping products to and invoicing our customers and consumers; marketing products to consumers; collecting, storing, transferring and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data; processing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers and vendors; hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, intellectual property, business plans and financial information; summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; complying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes involved in managing our business. Our IT systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, and are becoming more sophisticated. Such cyber-attacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers', IT systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. Although we have a broad array of information security measures in place, data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur. If we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our IT systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or damages. Furthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our IT systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm. We continue to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and ecommerce retailers. We also continue to invest behind our brands, not just in terms of advertising, but also to build key growth capabilities in areas such as innovation and data and analytics. The rapid growth in ecommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. Our ability to quickly innovate and to adapt our products to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy.

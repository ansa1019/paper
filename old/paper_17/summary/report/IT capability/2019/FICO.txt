We continue to expand the pursuit of our decision management strategy, which is designed to enable us to increase our business by selling multiple products to clients and developing custom client solutions. Our strategy is increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments. Factors that might affect market acceptance of our products include changes in technology and our ability to successfully adopt cloud-based technologies. Our growth and the success of our strategy depend upon our ability to develop and sell new products or suites of products, including cloud-based product offerings. Significant undetected errors or delays in new products may affect market acceptance and could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We rely on relatively few customers for a significant portion of our revenues, and many of our customers are significantly larger than we are, which may affect our bargaining power. The businesses of our largest customers depend, in large part, on favorable macroeconomic conditions, and if these customers are negatively impacted, our revenues and operating results could decline. Our reengineering initiative is designed to grow revenues through strategic resource allocation and improve profitability through cost reductions. Our management approach includes ongoing investments in technology and product development to enhance our operational efficiency and support our business needs. We believe that our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate and respond to changing customer needs, which includes leveraging our technology capabilities. Our ability to increase revenues will depend on introducing new products and services that keep pace with technological developments and satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products that achieve market acceptance. Our future success will depend on our ability to innovate by developing new technologies, effectively using third-party technologies, and responding to emerging industry standards. The market for business analytics is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, and we expect competition to persist and intensify. Our competitors may respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements, which could negatively affect our ability to expand our business. Our reliance on relationships with third parties for marketing, distribution, and certain services is critical, and any difficulties in these relationships could adversely affect our future revenues. Our products rely on distributors, and we intend to continue to market and distribute our products through existing and future distributor relationships. We also derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts with major credit reporting agencies, and any significant changes in these relationships could materially affect our revenues and results of operations. Our ongoing business may be disrupted by acquisitions or divestitures, which involve significant risks and uncertainties, including the potential inability to integrate acquired operations or technology successfully. We believe that our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel is critical to our future success, particularly in research and development, sales, and technical support. Our business requires that we develop or obtain a reliable source of sufficient amounts of current and statistically relevant data to analyze transactions and update our products. If we fail to maintain sufficient data sourcing relationships, our products and the development of new products might become less effective. Cybersecurity breaches could expose us to risks of unauthorized disclosure of consumer or customer information, which may damage our reputation and lead to significant liabilities. System interruptions could delay and disrupt our ability to develop, deliver, or maintain our products and services, causing harm to our business and reputation.

The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including risks associated with technological advances affecting energy consumption. Our operations are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing, and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. The oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements, and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if we cannot keep pace with these developments. Our business operations have grown substantially, and as we expand, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical, operational, and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating, and financial control systems could have a material adverse effect on our business. We utilize digital technologies to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment, and gathering systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and process and record financial and operating data. The accuracy of our assessments and the effectiveness of our operations depend on the reliability of our information management capabilities. We have made substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development, production, exploration, and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves, which are influenced by our ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources. Our future ability to grow proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us, including the effective management of our technology resources. Concerns over global economic conditions and the volatility of commodity prices may impact our ability to fund our capital expenditure programs, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and achieving competitive advantage. Our midstream operations segment's results are primarily driven by the volumes of crude oil that we gather, transport, and deliver, and the fees charged for these services are influenced by our operational efficiency and the effectiveness of our technology infrastructure. We rely on independent third-party service providers for many necessary services, and any inability to secure these services could negatively impact our operational capabilities. Our success depends on finding, developing, or acquiring additional reserves, which requires substantial capital and effective management of our technological capabilities. The accuracy of our oil and natural gas reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation, which are supported by our IT systems. Our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, and compliance with these regulations may impose additional costs and operational constraints that could affect our business performance. The integration of acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources, which may impact our operational capabilities. We are subject to cyber security risks, and a cyber incident could result in operational disruption and financial loss, further emphasizing the importance of our IT governance and management practices.

Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems or the inability to maintain or upgrade our information systems could disrupt operations, cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues, and result in less efficient operations. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to many aspects of our business, and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss relating to our information systems and are unable to recover in a timely manner. Our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable, pay expenses, and maintain the security of company and customer data is dependent in varying degrees on the effective and timely operation and support of our information technology systems. If critical information systems fail or these systems or related software or services are otherwise unavailable, or if we experience extended delays or unexpected expenses in securing, developing, and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support our growth and operations, it could adversely affect our profitability and/or ability to grow. Our information systems are protected with robust backup systems and processes, including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities. However, information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, telecommunication failures, and other problems. We have taken and continue to undertake significant steps to protect our customer and confidential information, but the possibility of cyber security incidents cannot be eliminated entirely. We develop and update processes and maintain systems to try to prevent data breaches and have established and maintained disclosure controls and procedures that would permit us to make accurate and timely disclosures of any material event, including any cyber security event. The development and maintenance of these processes and systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Our competitive advantage in our industrial vending business could be eliminated, and the loss of key suppliers of equipment and services for that business could be disruptive and could result in failure to deploy devices. We believe we have a competitive advantage in industrial vending due to our vending hardware and software, our local branch presence, and our distribution strength. Our ability to identify new products and product lines, and integrate them into our selling locations and distribution network, may impact our ability to compete, generate additional sales, and affect profit margins. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including those who understand and appreciate our culture and can adequately represent this culture to our customers. Our success is also influenced by the effectiveness of our technology capabilities, including our IT systems and processes, which are essential for supporting our operational efficiency and strategic objectives. The increase in IT spending reflects our commitment to enhancing our information management capabilities and ensuring that our technology infrastructure can support our growth drivers and operational needs. We may not be able to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our information systems, which could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and achieve our performance goals. The integration of new products and product lines into our branches and distribution network is crucial for maintaining competitiveness and meeting customer demands. Our ability to leverage technology resources effectively is essential for optimizing our business processes and enhancing overall organizational performance.

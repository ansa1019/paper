The failure to apply technology effectively in driving value for clients through technology-based solutions or to gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools could adversely affect operating results, client relationships, growth, and compliance programs. Future success depends, in part, on the ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption and developments in technology, including new applications or insurance-related services based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, blockchain, or new approaches to data mining. The organization relies on key third-party vendors and partners to provide technology and other support for strategic initiatives; failure of these third parties to perform their obligations could adversely affect the ability to execute on strategic initiatives. The integration of information systems from acquired businesses is complex and exposes the organization to additional risk, as weaknesses in the targets' information systems or information handling, privacy, and security policies and protocols may not be adequately identified, potentially exposing the organization to unexpected liabilities or making its own systems and data more vulnerable to attack. The organization has invested and continues to invest in technology security initiatives, policies, and resources, as well as employee training, to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal, and proprietary information. However, the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats makes it increasingly difficult to detect, defend against, and remediate incidents, and failure to maintain and upgrade system safeguards could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, and reputation. The organization must develop and implement technology solutions and technical expertise among employees that anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences, and internal control standards. If the organization cannot offer new technologies as quickly as competitors, or if competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, it could experience a material adverse effect on operating results, client relationships, growth, and compliance programs. The organization also faces significant competitive pressures in its businesses, with many firms actively competing in one or more areas globally. The primary factors determining competitive position include the quality of services rendered, personalized attention, and the ability to help clients manage overall insurance costs. The organization has historically acquired numerous insurance brokers and consulting firms, and the ability to continue this acquisition strategy is critical for maintaining growth. The integration of acquired businesses involves risks related to retention of personnel, clients, and ensuring compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements, which could adversely affect results of operations and growth. The organization is subject to various regulatory, legal, and accounting risks, including those related to data privacy and protection laws, which could impact business operations and financial results. The complexity and cost of compliance with laws and regulations increase as operations grow globally, necessitating the development of new policies, procedures, and internal controls, as well as training for employees in multiple locations.

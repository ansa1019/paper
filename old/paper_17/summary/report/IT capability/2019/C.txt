Citi's 2019 results reflected steady progress toward improving profitability and returns, driven by strong client engagement that fostered balanced growth across businesses and geographies. Citi demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in expenses that were largely unchanged from the prior year, while continuing to make investments in the franchise. The firm reported broad-based loan and deposit growth across its Global Consumer Banking (GCB) and Institutional Clients Group (ICG). In GCB, revenues increased 2%, driven by growth in all regions, while ICG revenues increased 3%, reflecting a 1% increase in banking revenues and a 5% increase in markets and securities services revenues. The firm’s operational efficiency was supported by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets, which offset volume-driven growth and ongoing investments. Citi's positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline contributed to an improvement in pretax earnings. The firm’s IT capabilities have evolved to comprehensively encompass the coordination of its assets and internal processes, which are critical for supporting business strategies and enhancing operational efficiency. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources, coupled with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities, underscores Citi's strategic resource allocation and management capability. The firm’s IT governance and resource management practices are integral to its business transformation efforts, enhancing its capacity to respond to market dynamics and consumer demands. Additionally, the firm’s investment in technology infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives reflects its commitment to maintaining competitive advantage and operational flexibility in a rapidly changing business environment. The increase in net income was primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate and higher revenues, partially offset by higher costs of credit. Citi's end-of-period loans and deposits also increased, indicating a robust market response and effective resource deployment strategies. The firm’s focus on optimizing performance while remaining adaptable to market conditions is evident in its strategic management practices and investment choices. Overall, Citi's performance metrics indicate a strong alignment of its IT capabilities with organizational goals, facilitating enhanced business value and operational effectiveness across its global operations.

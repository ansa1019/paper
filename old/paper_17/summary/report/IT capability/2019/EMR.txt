The company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. The company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; telecommunications or system failures; terrorist attacks; natural disasters; employee error or malfeasance; server or cloud provider breaches; and computer viruses or cyberattacks. Cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to more sophisticated and targeted measures directed at the company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers. Despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures, the company's information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security breaches. Should the company be unable to prevent security breaches or other damage to its information technology systems, disruptions could have an adverse effect on operations, as well as expose the company to litigation, liability or penalties under privacy laws, increased cybersecurity protection costs, reputational damage and product failure. The company’s substantial reliance on information technology systems underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by customers, which is influenced by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand. The company’s competitive strategy includes delivering solutions to customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost, which necessitates effective management of technology resources to enhance operational efficiency and support business innovation. The company's ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel is critical, as their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit operations and performance. The company engages in acquisitions and divestitures, which are subject to regulatory requirements and may encounter difficulties in integrating and separating these businesses. The success of these transactions will depend on the ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired and to cooperate with strategic partners. The company’s operations depend on production facilities worldwide, and disruptions in these facilities could adversely impact competitive positions and operational results. The company’s financial condition is influenced by its ability to maintain access to capital markets, which is essential for executing its business plan and making strategic investments. The company’s management relies on a system of internal accounting control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization. The company’s internal controls are critical for ensuring the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Overall, the company’s IT capabilities are integral to its strategic objectives, operational flexibility, and market responsiveness, thereby enhancing its competitive advantage in a dynamic business environment.

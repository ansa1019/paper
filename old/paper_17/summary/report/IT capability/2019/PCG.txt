Information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The emphasis on and overlap in safety metrics and weightings supports an organization-wide focus on safety in its compensation plans, which was further enhanced in the executive compensation redesign that is awaiting approval. The companies concluded that the risks arising from the overall compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on either PG&E Corporation or the utility. The committee believes that the redesigned short- and long-term performance-based compensation programs not only meet, but exceed, the mandates of AB 1054 by prioritizing public safety and customer welfare, without sacrificing financial stability. The 2020 executive compensation programs balance key safety, customer welfare, and financial issues facing the companies with the need to continue to recruit and retain qualified executives to guide the companies through a period of uncertainty. The companies' overall compensation policies are designed to attract, retain, and motivate officers with the necessary mix of skills and experience for the development and successful operation of PG&E Corporation's and the utility's businesses, particularly with regard to navigating the Chapter 11 restructuring process. The committee has worked closely with its advisors and the companies to redesign the executive compensation programs, which will apply both pre- and post-emergence from the Chapter 11 cases. The emphasis on safety and operational performance metrics in the incentive pay plans reflects the companies' commitment to enhancing safety and operational efficiency. The performance-based vesting conditions and overall performance score applicable to the portion of stock options vesting are aligned with the companies' operational and financial goals. The companies believe that non-GAAP earnings from operations provide additional insight into the underlying trends of the business, allowing for a better comparison against historical results and expectations for future performance. The methodology adjusts for drivers that are subject to volatility associated with the Chapter 11 cases. The companies' IT capabilities are critical in supporting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency, which is essential for navigating the complexities of the regulatory environment and market dynamics. The integration of technology resources and capabilities into the companies' operational framework is vital for achieving strategic objectives and maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving business landscape. The focus on mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities underscores the importance of IT governance and management skills in driving organizational performance and transformation.

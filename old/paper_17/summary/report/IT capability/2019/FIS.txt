We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including security breaches or attacks, which could harm our business by disrupting delivery of services and damaging our reputation. The uninterrupted operation of information systems, as well as the confidentiality of customer information, is critical to our successful operation. Cybersecurity is one of the principal operational risks we face as a provider of services to financial institutions. If we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure or adapt to emerging security threats, the confidentiality of the information we secure could be compromised. Unauthorized access to our computer systems could result in theft or publication of confidential information, damages from legal actions, or interruptions in our operations. Our ability to innovate or adapt our services to changes in technology or the marketplace is crucial, as failure to do so could lead to client loss and difficulty attracting new clients. The markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes, and our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance current solutions and develop new solutions that address the sophisticated needs of our clients. We continue to assist financial institutions in migrating to outsourced integrated technology solutions to improve profitability and address ongoing regulatory requirements. Our investment in modernization and innovation is essential to meet market demands and compete effectively. We have moved a significant portion of our server compute to our cloud, enhancing security and increasing the flexibility and speed with which we can provide services. We also invest in research and development activities primarily focused on modernizing our proprietary core systems and developing next-generation digital solutions. The integration of acquired companies, such as Worldpay, presents both opportunities and challenges, including the need to consolidate IT infrastructure and integrate technology platforms. We are focused on completing post-merger integration to achieve potential revenue opportunities and expense efficiencies. Our ability to partner with non-financial institution enterprises could create growth opportunities as new entrants seek to develop alternative electronic payment technologies. The payment processing industry is evolving with new technologies and business models, and we believe that our scalable, integrated business model positions us well to meet emerging client needs. We remain committed to making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and information systems, which includes capital expenditures on hardware, software, and personnel. Our ongoing cash requirements include operating expenses and capital expenditures to support core business initiatives. We expect to continue investing in property and equipment and software to enhance our capabilities and meet client demands. Our future growth and profitability will depend on our ability to manage expanded operations and effectively integrate new technologies and services into our offerings.

The company’s business depends on its information technology systems, which collect and process information of customers, associates, and other persons, as well as information of the business and its suppliers and service providers. The reliance on information technology systems is critical for managing key aspects of the business, including planning, purchasing, sales, supply chain management, inventory management, point-of-sale processing, e-commerce, human resources, financial management, communications, safeguarding information, and compliance with legal obligations. The ongoing integrity, security, and consistent operations of these systems are essential for successful growth. Compromises of data security or disruptions in information technology systems could materially impact operating results or harm reputation. The company faces risks from cyber attacks targeting its information technology systems, which are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The company maintains policies, procedures, and controls designed to reduce the risk of data security compromises and information technology failures or disruptions, requiring ongoing investment in technologies, hiring, training, and compliance. The complexity of operations increases the pressure on effectively managing internal resources and third-party providers to support the business. As the company grows, the risk that systems, controls, practices, and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout the organization increases, which could adversely affect business performance. The company must effectively allocate and deliver merchandise to stores and maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory, which is facilitated by its information technology capabilities. Effective management of pricing and markdowns is also reliant on these capabilities. The company’s growth strategy includes expanding within current markets and into new geographic regions, product lines, and channels, which requires leveraging technology resources and capabilities to support these initiatives. The company’s investment in technology is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and enhancing business processes. The ability to meet customer demand and expectations is tied to the company's capacity to identify consumer trends and preferences, which necessitates effective information management and technology deployment. The company’s ability to compete effectively in the retail market is influenced by its information technology capabilities, which support strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. Additionally, the company’s financial performance is impacted by its ability to manage its technology infrastructure and systems effectively, ensuring that information is shared appropriately across operations. The company’s ongoing operations and successful growth are dependent on accurately anticipating current and future information technology needs and successfully developing, implementing, and maintaining appropriate systems. The company’s reliance on information technology systems extends to managing relationships with suppliers and service providers, making it a strategic resource in achieving competitive advantage and enhancing organizational capabilities.

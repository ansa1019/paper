Occidental's businesses are subject to the actions and decisions of many federal, state, local, and foreign governments and political interests, which may restrict or prohibit activities, increase costs, or reduce demand for products. The oil and gas industry is increasingly dependent on digital and industrial control technologies to conduct exploration, development, and production activities. Occidental relies on digital and industrial control systems, related infrastructure, technologies, and networks to run its business and manage its oil and gas, chemicals, marketing, and pipeline operations. Cyber-attacks on businesses have escalated in recent years, exposing Occidental to risks that could disrupt operations, cause delays, impede processing of transactions, and result in the unintentional disclosure of sensitive information. A cyber-attack could negatively impact operations by causing unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, or other sensitive information, potentially harming the ability to compete for resources. The integration of newly acquired assets is expected to utilize Occidental's subsurface and operating expertise to improve productivity and reduce full cycle costs. Occidental's strategy focuses on maintaining a sustainable and sector-leading dividend, allocating capital to high-return opportunities, generating free cash flow growth, and achieving production growth rates. The company aims to maximize shareholder returns through efficient capital allocation and deployment, with key performance metrics including health, safety, environmental performance, and return on capital employed. The oil and gas segment benefits from scale, technical expertise, high-margin inventory, and commercial collaboration, allowing for quick production to market and low-cost returns-driven growth opportunities with advanced technology. Occidental's marketing and midstream segment seeks to maximize realized value by optimizing the use of its gathering, processing, transportation, storage, and terminal commitments, while also providing access to domestic and international markets. The chemical segment focuses on being a low-cost producer to maximize cash flow generation, with a concentration on chlorovinyls chain production. Occidental's operational efficiencies are enhanced through innovative technologies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and improving competitiveness. The company's capital expenditures are primarily focused on high-return, short-cycle, cash-flow-generating opportunities, particularly in the Permian Basin, which is expected to provide sustainability of Occidental's low-cost position. Occidental's environmental remediation liabilities are assessed based on management's estimates of the most likely cost to be incurred, and the company periodically reviews these liabilities to adjust for new information. The company is also involved in various legal proceedings and audits that may affect its financial position, but it believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated balance sheets. Occidental's operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, which may require significant expenditures for compliance and remediation. The company continues to evaluate its environmental obligations and the potential impact of regulatory changes on its operations and financial condition.

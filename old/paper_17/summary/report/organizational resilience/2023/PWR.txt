Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including operational hazards such as wildfires and explosions, which can result in significant liabilities and disrupt our operations. The unavailability or cancellation of third-party insurance would increase our risk exposure and could adversely affect our ability to recover from such events. Our business and operating results are subject to physical risks associated with climate change, which can significantly impact our future operating results and may have a long-term impact on our financial condition and cash flows. We recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks regardless of how and where we conduct our operations, and catastrophic natural disasters can negatively impact projects we are working on and cause work stoppages and financial losses. Our ability to efficiently manage our business and achieve our strategic initiatives is limited by our ability to employ, train, and retain the necessary skilled personnel, which is subject to various risks, including labor shortages and increased costs. The cyclical nature of certain industries can create shortages of qualified labor during periods of high demand, which may impact our operational flexibility and ability to respond to customer needs. We may also face difficulties in managing our workforce size due to the uncertainty of contract award timing and project delays. Our inability to efficiently manage our workforce may require us to incur costs resulting from excess staff or reductions in staff, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The loss of business from significant customers could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Changes in estimates related to revenues and costs under customer contracts could result in a reduction or elimination of revenues or profits. Our business is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could negatively impact our business. We are subject to various regulatory requirements that could result in significant compliance costs and liabilities, which may adversely affect our business. The nature of our business exposes us to warranty, engineering, and other related claims, and we may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts due to health and safety matters. Disruptions to our information technology systems or failure to adequately protect critical data could materially affect our business or result in harm to our reputation. Our operations are inherently hazardous and subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. We have invested substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs, but there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure. Our management structure could be inadequate to support our business as it expands and becomes more complex, and we may encounter difficulties managing our business, including coordinating and executing business strategies. The loss of, or our inability to attract, key personnel could disrupt our business. Our investments expose us to risks and may result in conflicts of interest that could adversely impact our business or result in reputational harm. Changes in economic conditions, including those resulting from geopolitical conflicts, civil unrest, public health crises, and acts of terrorism, may adversely affect demand for our services and our customers' ability to pay for our services. Our ability to generate cash from operations is influenced by demand for our services and operating margins, as well as the timing of working capital needs associated with the various types of services that we provide. Our working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs are required to be paid before the associated receivables are billed and collected.

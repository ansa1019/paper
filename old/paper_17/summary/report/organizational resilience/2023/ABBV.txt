AbbVie is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in medical reimbursement policies, and political and economic instability, which may adversely affect its organizational resilience. The company relies on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of its products, and failures by these partners to meet their obligations could negatively impact AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business continuity. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of biologics is a long, expensive, and uncertain process, which requires operational flexibility and adaptability to navigate the complexities of regulatory requirements. AbbVie’s financial performance may be impacted by public health outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated modifications to business practices and highlighted the importance of crisis management and preparedness. The company’s ability to effectively respond to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical for maintaining operational continuity and organizational health. AbbVie’s strategy includes maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base and leveraging its commercial strength across therapeutic areas, which supports its resilience strategies in the face of competitive pressures and market volatility. The organization must continue to invest in innovative research and development to ensure future growth and sustainability, while also managing the risks associated with patent expirations and the introduction of biosimilars. The impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on drug pricing and reimbursement is a significant external pressure that could affect AbbVie's financial condition and necessitate strategic adaptation. The company’s reliance on third-party service providers introduces additional risks, as disruptions in these relationships could impair AbbVie's ability to deliver products effectively. Furthermore, AbbVie’s operational resources and financial resources must be managed effectively to mitigate risks associated with manufacturing complexities and supply chain interruptions. The organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity is essential for its long-term success and resilience in a turbulent market environment. The ongoing evaluation of its strategic initiatives and the ability to confront and adapt to unexpected situations will determine AbbVie's organizational effectiveness and overall performance under pressure.

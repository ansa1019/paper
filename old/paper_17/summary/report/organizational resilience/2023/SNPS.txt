The occurrence of risks and uncertainties associated with our business could materially and adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and stock price. Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including increased global inflationary pressures, potential economic slowdowns, and supply chain disruptions, has resulted in volatility in credit and equity markets, which could lead customers to postpone decision-making and decrease spending. This caution may limit our ability to maintain or increase sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts. The current macroeconomic environment has impacted our software integrity segment as customers have applied elevated scrutiny to purchasing decisions due to their own budget uncertainty, affecting order size and contract duration. We are actively monitoring geopolitical pressures, including changes in international relations and conflicts, which could materially affect our employees, business, and financial condition. Our business model provides stability; however, the broader implications of these macroeconomic or geopolitical events remain uncertain. The semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex and interconnected ecosystems, with many customers outsourcing manufacturing and incorporating third-party intellectual property into their designs. If we fail to optimize our solutions for use with major foundries or if access to such processes is hampered, our offerings may become less desirable, adversely affecting our business. We operate in highly competitive industries, and our ability to meet customer demand for innovative technology at lower costs is crucial to maintaining competitive advantage. The increasing complexity of designs and customers' concerns about managing costs could lead to a decrease in design activity. Our growth strategy is based on maintaining leadership in design automation products, expanding design IP offerings, and continuing to grow our product portfolio. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months. However, our future cash requirements will depend on various factors, including our rate of revenue growth and the timing of our spending to support research and development efforts. We are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations, which could expose us to numerous risks. Our business operations are also exposed to risks from catastrophic events and climate change, which may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. The global nature of our operations subjects us to increased risks and compliance obligations, including economic slowdowns and uncertainty in financial markets. Difficulties in adapting to cultural differences and potential disruptions from geopolitical conflicts could adversely affect our business. Our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees is critical, as competition for talent is intense. We may face challenges in integrating acquired businesses and technologies, which could disrupt ongoing operations and divert management's attention. Our financial results are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in tax laws, which could result in increased tax expenses. The impact of these risks on our business, operating results, and financial condition remains uncertain, necessitating proactive measures to enhance organizational resilience and adaptability in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

The risks listed in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully, particularly those that could adversely affect our operational flexibility and ability to adapt under challenging conditions. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical, as failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and manage inventory could adversely affect our results. The ability to allocate and deliver merchandise effectively is essential to meet customer demand, and our operational management must remain flexible to respond to rapidly changing market conditions. Temporary store closures, inflationary pressures, and global supply chain disruptions have impacted our inventory management and ability to maintain our desired mix and level of inventory. Our success depends on identifying consumer trends and preferences, and we seek to offer experiences that align with these trends. However, failure to do so effectively could negatively impact our performance. The competitive landscape in the retail sector is highly dynamic, and our ability to compete effectively is influenced by various factors, including merchandise selection, service quality, and marketing effectiveness. Our growth strategy involves expanding into new markets and calibrating product lines, which adds complexity to our operations and requires effective information sharing and management of resources. The substantial size of our operations increases the risk that our systems and practices may not be implemented consistently, which could adversely affect our organizational effectiveness. We rely heavily on our information technology systems, and any disruptions could materially impair our operations. Cybersecurity risks are heightened by the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, which necessitates robust risk management strategies. We face challenges in managing our large workforce, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity and effective service delivery. Labor market dynamics, including wage pressures and competition for talent, could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates. Damage to our corporate reputation could adversely affect customer loyalty and sales, particularly in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment. Our international operations expose us to risks inherent in new markets, including compliance with local laws and understanding local customs. Economic conditions, geopolitical uncertainty, and public health crises can adversely affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending, impacting our financial performance. Our strategies for managing these risks may not always be effective, and changes in economic conditions could increase our financial exposure. We must also navigate fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can impact our revenues and costs. Our operational resilience is tested by severe weather, catastrophic events, and other disruptions that could affect our supply chain and customer engagement. As we continue to expand, our ability to manage these multifaceted challenges will be critical to our organizational resilience and long-term success.

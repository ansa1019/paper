JPMorgan Chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program designed to enable it to prepare for, adapt to, withstand, and recover from business disruptions that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology, third-party service providers, and facilities. The ability to respond effectively to business disruption events could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets, or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed or concentrated. Extraordinary events or factors that contribute to those events becoming more chronic could lead to significant and long-lasting disruptive effects on JPMorgan Chase's business and operations, as well as on its clients, customers, counterparties, and employees. Any significant failure or disruption of operations or operational systems could hinder the ability to provide services to clients and customers or to transact with counterparties, requiring substantial resources to correct the failure or disruption, potentially causing losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries. The occurrence of extraordinary events could also negatively impact the financial condition or creditworthiness of clients and customers, leading to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses, and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce earnings. 

JPMorgan Chase's operational systems depend on the effectiveness of internal and external systems, and the quality of the information contained in those systems is critical. The effective functioning of operational systems relies on the ability to maintain and upgrade systems regularly in line with technological advancements and evolving security requirements. The company has experienced failures and disruptions in the stability of its operational systems, which have resulted in negative effects for customers, including the inability to access account information or make transactions. The increasing complexity of transactions and attempts by third parties to defraud the company can heighten operational risks. 

JPMorgan Chase's risk management framework seeks to quantify and manage exposure to extreme market moves, but inadequacies or lapses in this framework could expose the company to unexpected losses. The effectiveness of risk management strategies may be limited during periods of market stress, and sudden market movements could lead to significant losses. The company also relies on data to assess risk exposures, and deficiencies in data accuracy or timeliness could result in ineffective risk management practices. 

The organization faces substantial legal and operational risks, including those arising from litigation and regulatory investigations. Heightened regulatory scrutiny may lead to additional investigations or enforcement actions, which could harm reputation and result in increased operational costs. The ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to success, and staffing shortages or ineffective implementation of business decisions could materially affect performance. 

JPMorgan Chase's operations are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules, and regulations, and failures to comply could lead to significant liabilities or regulatory fines. The company must also navigate the impacts of climate change, which could adversely affect its business and operations, both directly and through impacts on clients and customers.

Our business and operations are subject to many risks, including environmental disruptions and operational challenges that may affect our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The volatility of crude oil, natural gas liquids (ngls), and natural gas prices can materially and adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We have experienced inflationary pressures on our operating costs and capital expenditures, which have impacted our cash flows and results of operations. To mitigate these impacts, we have undertaken initiatives to enhance drilling, completion, and operational efficiencies, which are integral to maintaining our operational flexibility and resilience. Our ability to respond effectively to external pressures, including market volatility and supply chain disruptions, is critical for sustaining our performance under pressure. 

We continuously evaluate our operational strategies to ensure we can adapt to unexpected situations and maintain our competitive advantage. The successful execution of our business strategy relies on our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adverse conditions. We have implemented cost-mitigation initiatives to offset inflationary pressures, which include securing agreements with service providers to stabilize costs and availability of services. However, there can be no assurance that these efforts will fully mitigate future impacts on our operations.

Our financial health is closely tied to our ability to manage risks associated with commodity price fluctuations and operational disruptions. The availability and capacity of gathering, processing, and transportation facilities are essential to our operational continuity. Disruptions in these areas can lead to significant challenges in maintaining production levels and achieving our major objectives. We are also exposed to reputational risks, particularly in relation to climate change and the evolving regulatory landscape, which could affect our ability to secure financing and execute our business strategy.

We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement in navigating complex situations and enhancing our organizational resilience. Our strategic initiatives are designed to foster adaptability and responsiveness to environmental perturbations and competitive pressures. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and operational integrity, which are vital for our long-term sustainability and success. 

In light of the uncertainties associated with global economic conditions, we are focused on enhancing our organizational capabilities and ensuring we have the necessary resources to confront future challenges. Our approach includes ongoing assessments of our operational practices and the implementation of proactive measures to strengthen our resilience strategies. We remain vigilant in monitoring external disturbances and their potential implications on our business, ensuring that we are prepared to respond effectively to any crises that may arise.

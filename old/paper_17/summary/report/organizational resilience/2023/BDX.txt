An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect BD's business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. Business, economic, and industry risks, including global economic conditions, inflation, and supply chain disruptions, could continue to adversely affect operations. General economic downturns may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for products and services, disrupt supply chains, and impair the ability to produce products. The company has experienced significant challenges in its global supply chain, including shortages in supply and disruptions or delays in shipments, which could impact operational continuity. While BD has managed these challenges without significant disruption to its business, there is no assurance that these efforts will continue to be successful. The company is focused on delivering durable growth and creating shareholder value through strategic initiatives that include investments in research and development, innovation, and operational effectiveness. BD's management aligns its operating model with strategic pillars aimed at simplifying operations, enhancing customer experiences, and creating more resilient operations through investments in renewable energy strategies. The transition of healthcare services from acute to non-acute settings has increased financial pressure on healthcare systems, which may impact future demand for products and services. The company continues to invest in geographic expansion and new product programs to drive revenue growth while mitigating macroeconomic pressures through procurement, logistics, and manufacturing capabilities. However, there can be no assurance that BD will effectively mitigate these pressures in future periods. The impact of public health crises, such as pandemics, could result in reductions in demand for certain products and disruptions to operations. Additionally, geopolitical conditions may contribute to macroeconomic uncertainty and supply chain constraints. BD's ability to attract and retain key employees is critical for maintaining operational effectiveness, and competition for experienced employees can be a challenge. The company is also subject to various regulatory requirements that could impact its operations and financial performance. The military conflict in Ukraine has increased global economic and political uncertainty, which could adversely affect BD's business. Operational risks include breaches of information and technology systems, which could have a material adverse effect on operations. The company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with anti-corruption laws, but international operations create risks of unauthorized payments. The medical technology industry is highly competitive, and BD faces significant competition from a range of existing competitors and new market entrants. Changes in customer preferences and regulatory standards may require significant investment to maintain compliance and remain competitive. BD's future growth depends on its ability to innovate and develop new products while effectively managing costs and operational resources. The company is committed to fostering a purpose-driven culture that emphasizes positive impact on stakeholders and sustainability initiatives across its organizational units.

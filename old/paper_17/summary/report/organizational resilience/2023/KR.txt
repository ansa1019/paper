There are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business, including the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The integration of new business and strategic alliances may allow for future growth, but achieving the anticipated benefits may be subject to significant challenges and uncertainties, including whether unique corporate cultures will work collaboratively and the coordination of geographically separate organizations. The ability to anticipate customer preferences and quickly adapt to changing needs is crucial; failing to do so could adversely affect sales and profitability. We are enhancing customer connections through investments in strategic pillars designed to generate customer loyalty and sustainable growth momentum. Our ecosystem monetizes traffic and data insights generated by our retail grocery business, creating fast-growing, asset-light revenue streams. The operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense competition and evolving customer preferences, necessitating operational flexibility and strategic adaptation to maintain performance under pressure. We must continue to implement technology, software, and processes to fulfill customer orders conveniently and cost-effectively. The nature and extent to which competitors respond to evolving competitive dynamics could adversely affect our profitability. We are committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating and managing our operational resources effectively to ensure resilience against economic downturns. Our business is increasingly dependent on complex information technology systems vital to operations, and any difficulties in maintaining or operating these systems could result in significant losses. Cybersecurity threats pose risks that could disrupt business operations and affect customer trust. We recognize the importance of maintaining operational continuity and flexibility in the face of environmental perturbations and other external pressures. The long-term effects of global climate change present both physical and transition risks that could disrupt our operations and affect our ability to procure goods and services. We continue to evaluate our potential exposure to underfunded multi-employer pension plans, which could have important consequences for our financial condition. Our strategic initiatives are focused on enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency, with a commitment to investing in associates and technology to support these goals. The proposed merger with Albertsons is expected to accelerate our go-to-market strategy and enhance our ability to navigate complex market conditions. We believe our value creation model will enable us to meet the evolving needs of our customers while generating sustainable growth. The ability to recover from adverse conditions and maintain organizational health is essential for our long-term success, and we are committed to fostering a culture of resilience and adaptability throughout our organization.

Our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. Significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation, or other necessary supplies or services could adversely affect our financial results. Supplier constraints and an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements could also disrupt production output. We utilize various pricing structures and revenue growth management strategies to manage these risks. Failure of key technology systems, cyberattacks, or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and reputation. We rely extensively on information and operational technology systems, which are vulnerable to cyber threats. The increasing sophistication of cyber threats complicates our ability to defend against them, and we may experience interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business. Our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and political instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. Our strategy includes growth outside the U.S., particularly in developing markets, and we face various risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, which may have material adverse effects on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our operations, causing volatility in demand and disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain. We are actively monitoring the situation and may not be able to sustain operations under current conditions. Disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business. Our ability to manufacture, distribute, and sell products is critical, and we face inherent risks such as natural disasters, labor strikes, and governmental regulatory requirements. We have a complex network of suppliers, and disruptions at these suppliers could adversely impact our operations and sales. We continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations. Our growth strategy is built on delivering value-added innovations and driving category opportunities while maintaining financial discipline. We are subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our business operations and financial results, including increased regulation of data collection and changes in existing laws. Our reputation is critical to our relationship with consumers, and any adverse publicity could negatively impact sentiment towards us. We have implemented significant adjustments to our business in response to geopolitical events, particularly the war in Ukraine, which has led to increased input costs and supply chain complexities. We are also monitoring the increased risk of cyber-based attacks as a result of these events. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is essential, and a tight labor market could lead to increased turnover and costs. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace, and changes in consumer purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial results. Our strategic focus includes sustainability initiatives and innovation to adapt to evolving consumer preferences. We are committed to enhancing our operational efficiencies through system upgrades and improvements in our supply chain productivity. Our capital allocation strategy supports our growth initiatives while maintaining a strong focus on risk management and resilience in the face of external pressures.

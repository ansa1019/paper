This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of management and are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Among the factors that could impact performance are general economic and market conditions, including inflation and changes in costs that are not within control, as well as competition and demand for services in the environmental services industry. The ability to manage growth and execute growth strategies is crucial, as is compliance with environmental regulations and obtaining necessary approvals from regulatory agencies. Severe weather conditions, including those brought about by climate change, could impair financial results by causing increased costs, loss of revenue, reduced operational efficiency, or disruptions to operations. The capital-intensive nature of the business may consume cash in excess of cash flow from operations, and the ability to obtain or maintain required permits could decrease revenue and increase costs. The organization’s dependence on key personnel and large contracts poses risks, as does exposure to liabilities not adequately covered by insurance. The ability to achieve sustainability goals, including greenhouse gas emissions reduction, is subject to uncertainties, including the development of necessary technologies and compliance with evolving regulations. The organization must also navigate risks associated with cybersecurity incidents that could disrupt operations and impact relationships with customers and employees. The environmental services industry is characterized by significant competition, and the organization must continuously adapt to changes in market conditions and customer needs. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform operations to emerge stronger from challenges is essential for maintaining organizational resilience. The organization’s financial strategy is impacted by substantial indebtedness, which may limit financial flexibility and the ability to withstand economic downturns. The ability to maintain investment-grade ratings on debt is crucial for accessing capital and managing costs. The organization’s operational flexibility is vital for adapting to unexpected situations and ensuring continuity of operations. The management of risks related to environmental obligations and liabilities is critical for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. The organization must also address pressures from regulatory changes and community opposition, which could affect the ability to operate and expand facilities. The strategic initiatives undertaken to enhance operational capabilities and resilience are essential for navigating the complexities of the environmental services landscape. The organization’s capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is a key determinant of its long-term success and sustainability in a turbulent market environment.

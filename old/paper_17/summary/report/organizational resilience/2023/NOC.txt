Our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S. government, for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in this customer's priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. The U.S. government has the ability to delay, modify, or cancel ongoing competitions, procurements, and programs, as well as to change its future acquisition strategy, which introduces significant uncertainties. Significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs can negatively impact our business and programs, and the uncertain political environment, along with substantial fiscal, economic, and security challenges, may affect funding and budgetary priorities. We face pressures on our ability to maintain operational continuity and performance under pressure, particularly in a challenging macroeconomic environment characterized by high inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions. 

We aim to mitigate risks through strategic initiatives and resource allocation, including seeking equitable adjustments and engineering change proposals to recover unexpected cost increases. Our operating income can be adversely affected when estimated contract costs increase, particularly under fixed-price contracts, which inherently carry more financial risk. The global macroeconomic environment has experienced extraordinary challenges, leading to increased costs and delays that adversely impact our customers, our industry, and our company. We continue to work proactively to mitigate these challenges, including enhancing our workforce through hiring and retention efforts.

The ability to win new competitions and meet customer needs depends on maintaining a qualified workforce and adapting to the evolving market landscape. Our success relies on our ability to innovate, develop new products and technologies, and effectively manage operational resources. We recognize that our organizational effectiveness is influenced by our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The occurrence of natural disasters poses additional risks to our operations, potentially disrupting performance and impacting our financial position. 

We are also subject to various legal and regulatory risks that could adversely affect our reputation and ability to conduct business. The improper conduct of employees, agents, or subcontractors can impact our organizational health and resilience. Our international business exposes us to geopolitical and economic factors that may affect our ability to operate effectively. We face various risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, which may have material adverse effects on our business and financial position. 

In summary, our organizational resilience is tested by external pressures, operational challenges, and the need for effective risk management strategies. We must continuously adapt to changing conditions, ensuring that we maintain our competitive advantage and operational flexibility in the face of adversity.

We operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties, which could affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. We are subject to various risks that, if realized, could materially harm our business. Our ability to generate profits and positive cash flow from operations depends significantly on the continued success in commercializing our products. The commercial success of our products is subject to significant competition, and we must maintain operational flexibility to adapt to changing market dynamics. Our manufacturing capacity will likely not be sufficient as we increase production in response to higher product demand, which could jeopardize our clinical development programs. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of certain products, and any failure of these collaborators to perform adequately could adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture, and commercialize our products. Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, and compliance with these laws is costly. Significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of data security could adversely affect our business. Public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business. Our financial condition is influenced by various factors, including the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to research and development activities, which require significant resources. The lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals requires the expenditure of substantial resources, and any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining such approvals could materially adversely affect our business. We are also subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, and failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in substantial remedial costs, delays in the development or approval of our product candidates, and a reduction in sales. Our business activities have been, and may in the future be, challenged under healthcare laws, which may subject us to civil or criminal proceedings. We face risks related to the personal data we collect, process, and share, and compliance with data privacy laws is complex and costly. We have limited commercial capabilities outside the United States and would need to further develop or outsource these capabilities. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is crucial to our success, and we face intense competition for qualified scientists and managerial personnel. Our reliance on third-party service providers for distribution and other related activities may also impact our ability to commercialize our products effectively. The impact of external pressures, including changes in laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business. Our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, including the scope and progress of our research and development efforts and the continuation of our collaborations. We must effectively manage these risks and uncertainties to maintain organizational resilience and ensure operational continuity.

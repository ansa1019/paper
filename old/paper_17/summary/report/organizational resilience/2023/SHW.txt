The company’s business, operations, and business plans and strategies are sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions, which may adversely affect demand for some of its products and impair its ability to predict and meet future changes in demand. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including inflation rates, interest rates, and geopolitical conditions, have historically impacted the company’s results of operations and may continue to do so. The company operates in a cyclical industry, where economic downturns can depress demand for its products, particularly in construction and housing segments, affecting sales, earnings, and cash flow. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions have caused disruptions in supply chains and logistics, which could materially impact the company’s ability to meet customer demands. The company’s operations are also subject to unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy, which may adversely affect earnings or cash flow. Environmental and social regulations, including those related to climate change, have the potential to negatively impact the availability and cost of raw materials, as well as the company’s operations. The company’s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to meet business needs in the event of disruptions caused by catastrophic events or adverse weather conditions. The company acknowledges that its facilities and systems are not fully redundant, which may hinder its ability to manufacture products needed to meet customer demand during such events. The company’s financial condition and liquidity are influenced by its ability to generate cash from operations, which is subject to various factors beyond its control, including supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions. The company has implemented various risk management and compliance programs to mitigate compliance risks associated with evolving laws and regulations, which may increase operational costs. The company’s ability to attract, retain, and develop a qualified workforce is critical to meeting its strategic objectives, and it continues to face challenges due to a tightened labor market. The company’s strategic initiatives include investments in technology and operational efficiencies to enhance its competitive position and adaptability in a rapidly changing market environment. The company also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive perception and reputation among stakeholders, as significant negative publicity could adversely impact its business. The company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is a key aspect of its resilience strategy. The company’s focus on sustainability considerations reflects its commitment to adapting to evolving stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements, which are increasingly scrutinized by various stakeholders. The company’s financial performance is subject to fluctuations due to various external pressures, including market volatility and competitive landscape changes, which necessitate ongoing assessment and adaptation of its strategies to ensure organizational resilience.

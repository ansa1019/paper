Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including operational and strategic risks that could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and growth. Effective management of our operational, financial, and human resources is critical to implementing our business strategy, which requires adaptation to external pressures such as increased competition, legal developments, and economic conditions. We may face challenges in hiring or retaining personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively, and our ability to maintain cost savings achieved through automation and optimization efforts may be impacted by inflationary cost pressures. Additionally, strategic decisions regarding our asset portfolio may result in impairments, and our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on identifying desirable targets and negotiating advantageous transactions. Execution of our strategy may cause us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, diverting capital away from traditional operations and introducing additional risks and volatility to our financial performance. We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets, which may not be successfully negotiated, potentially resulting in asset impairments. Our operations must comply with extensive regulations, and changes in regulations can restrict or alter our operations, increase operating costs, and require additional capital expenditures. We have significant financial obligations related to environmental remediation, and expenditures could materially exceed our accruals due to regulatory changes or new information about waste types. Severe weather events and climate change can significantly affect our operating results, and we must adapt to these environmental perturbations. We are committed to sustainability and have set goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but we may face challenges in meeting these goals due to unforeseen costs, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory impacts. Our sustainability growth strategy includes significant investments in recycling processing and sales and renewable energy segments, which may be impacted by market volatility and changes in commodity prices. We are also subject to operational and safety risks, including personal injury to employees and others, and we seek to minimize exposure to such risks through comprehensive training and recovery programs. Our reputation and brand value are critical to our business, and adverse publicity could negatively impact demand for our services. We face intense competition in the environmental services industry, and our ability to compete effectively depends on our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives. We are focused on enhancing our operational efficiency through technology investments and automation, which are intended to reduce labor dependency and improve customer service. Our financial results are influenced by macroeconomic pressures, including inflation and rising interest rates, which impact our operating expenses and ability to dynamically manage our cost structure. We are committed to maintaining a high-quality workforce and investing in our people to ensure operational continuity and effective execution of our business strategy. The ability to attract and retain key team members is essential for achieving our strategic priorities and mitigating risks associated with employee turnover.

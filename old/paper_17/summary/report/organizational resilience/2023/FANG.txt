The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including market conditions and volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, which may adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability, growth, production, and the present value of our estimated reserves. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all to fund our acquisitions or development activities, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves and future production. Our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations that require compliance, which can be burdensome and expensive, potentially imposing restrictions on our operations. The inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results. Our operations are also subject to risks associated with our primary operations concentrated in a single geographic area, making us vulnerable to environmental perturbations and unexpected situations that could disrupt our functioning. 

We are exposed to risks associated with our substantial level of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. Implementing our capital programs may require an increase in our total leverage through additional debt issuances, and any significant reduction in availability under our revolving credit facility could require us to curtail our capital expenditures. Our success depends on finding, developing, or acquiring additional reserves, and our future success is highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. 

The enactment of climate change-related regulations may impose new costs on our operations that could have a material and adverse effect on us. These developments may reduce the demand for products manufactured with hydrocarbons and the prices of the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell, adversely impacting our business. The focus on climate change matters has increased, resulting in potential reputational risks associated with our operations, which may adversely affect our ability to attract capital. 

We rely on several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production, and the loss of one or more of these purchasers could limit our access to suitable markets. Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water, and restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 

We have developed targets related to our environmental, social, and governance initiatives, including emissions reduction targets and strategies. Our ability to achieve these targets is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Failure to achieve our announced targets may expose us to government enforcement actions or private litigation and adversely impact our business. 

We are also subject to cybersecurity risks that could result in operational disruption and financial loss. Our reliance on technology has increased due to the evolving business environment, and any compromise of our systems could materially and adversely affect our operations. We have implemented controls and protections designed to mitigate these risks, but we cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats. 

Our operations are characterized by significant technological advancements, and we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if we cannot keep pace with these developments. The ability to adapt to changes in the competitive landscape and respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical to our organizational resilience and overall performance.

AEP's business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of additional transmission and renewable generation facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure, and installation of environmental upgrades and retrofits. AEP's experience with transmission facilities construction and operation gives it an advantage over competitors in securing authorization to install, construct, and operate new transmission lines and facilities. However, AEP's ability to recover costs associated with these investments is dependent on regulatory approvals, which may not be guaranteed. Regulatory actions or litigation outcomes that trigger a reversal of a regulatory asset or deferred cost generally result in an impairment to the balance sheet and a charge to the income statement. AEP's regulated utility businesses could be subject to public criticism or adverse publicity focused on their preparedness for major storms or other extreme weather events, which could negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes. The energy industry has experienced rising costs and investments, which could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for cost recovery mechanisms that may face resistance from customers and stakeholders. AEP's operations are subject to numerous risks, including operator error, equipment failure, compliance with mandatory reliability standards, and cybersecurity threats, which could severely impair operations and lead to significant financial harm. AEP's operations depend on the proper functioning of its internal systems, including information technology systems that support business processes and store sensitive data. Any significant failure or malfunction of these systems may disrupt operations and adversely affect financial performance. Additionally, AEP's operations are heavily regulated, and compliance with environmental statutes and regulations requires significant capital investment, which could impact financial condition. The company faces risks related to climate change, including physical risks from extreme weather events that may increase costs and require additional investments in infrastructure to maintain service reliability. AEP's financial performance is tied to the health of the regional economies it serves, and adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand and impact revenues. The company is also exposed to risks related to supply chain disruptions, which could delay construction and maintenance of necessary infrastructure. AEP's ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce is critical for operational continuity, and challenges in this area could lead to increased costs and operational difficulties. Furthermore, AEP's capacity obligations are subject to various factors, including regulatory requirements and the retirement of existing generating facilities, which could affect its ability to meet reliability needs. AEP's strategic initiatives, including efforts to achieve carbon reduction goals, are contingent upon successful execution of renewable resource plans and compliance with evolving regulatory requirements. The company must navigate a complex landscape of stakeholder expectations and regulatory scrutiny, which could impact its operational flexibility and strategic response to environmental and market pressures.

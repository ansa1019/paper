The risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on Form 10-K include various factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential, sensitive, and other types of data, which are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information. Cyber threats continue to evolve and become more difficult to detect and mitigate, potentially defeating the measures we or our third-party service providers take to anticipate, detect, avoid, or mitigate such threats. Our businesses often access material non-public information concerning customers, the unauthorized disclosure of which could damage competitive positions and customer confidence in our ability to protect confidential information. We devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes designed to protect the security of our information systems. However, such measures may be circumvented or become obsolete, and additional measures may be expensive or ineffective. Our ability to deliver products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious software, human error, or natural disasters, which could harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. We are exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software, and while we conduct cyber due diligence during acquisitions, weaknesses in acquired entities' information systems may expose us to unexpected liabilities. The markets in which we operate continuously change to adapt to customer needs, and our inability to innovate and compete with new or enhanced products could impact our profitability. We invest in innovation, new offerings, and enhancements, but these sometimes do not achieve market acceptance or the expected level of profitability. The rapid change of technology necessitates improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, and support new products effectively. Enhancing existing products and developing new ones requires effective collaboration across various divisions, and ineffective collaboration may decrease our ability to expand geographically and innovate. Our operations may be materially impacted by disruptions in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, including technological failures and natural disasters. We regularly assess and improve our business continuity plans, but significant disasters could materially interrupt our operations and result in financial loss. Our reputation, credibility, and brand are key assets, and negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation, affecting our ability to attract and retain customers. We are also subject to various legal and regulatory risks that could adversely affect our operations. The financial services industry is highly regulated, and changes in legislation or regulation could increase our costs and impact our ability to provide products and services. Our ability to attract and retain key qualified personnel is critical to our success, and difficulties in recruiting could adversely affect our business. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing customer support, investing in customer-facing solutions, and strengthening data management capabilities. We continuously evaluate our regulatory and compliance obligations, and the evolving regulatory landscape presents both risks and opportunities for our business.

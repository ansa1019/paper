Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including unforeseen or catastrophic events, which have historically impacted our operations and may continue to do so. The occurrence of public health crises, such as COVID-19, has highlighted the need for effective crisis management and operational flexibility to maintain business continuity and adapt to changing conditions. We have implemented a detailed COVID-19 response plan to mitigate its impact on our results. Our operational strategies focus on optimizing field operations to improve servicing capabilities and enhance sales force effectiveness, which are essential for maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. The equipment rental industry is highly competitive and fragmented, requiring us to continuously assess our competitive advantage and adapt our strategies to address external pressures and market volatility. Our ability to manage credit risk and maintain relationships with key suppliers is critical for operational continuity, especially during economic downturns that may increase delinquencies and credit losses. We have pursued strategic acquisitions to expand our core business, which involves risks related to integration and operational efficiency. Our restructuring programs, often initiated following major acquisitions, are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and operational management, although they may also introduce temporary challenges. We rely on our information technology systems to monitor and control operations, and disruptions in these systems could adversely affect our ability to respond to unexpected situations. Our financial flexibility is supported by liquidity management practices, which are essential for navigating adverse economic conditions. We have also recognized the importance of environmental and social goals, including our greenhouse gas intensity reduction goal, which reflects our commitment to sustainability and resilience in the face of regulatory changes. The evolving perspectives of stakeholders regarding climate change necessitate proactive measures to ensure we meet our environmental objectives while maintaining operational effectiveness. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing customer service through digital capabilities and optimizing our customer and fleet mix to support profitable growth. The ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes is vital for organizational survival, and we continuously evaluate our performance and adapt our strategies accordingly. We have established a framework for assessing risks and opportunities, which is integral to our decision-making processes and future planning. Our focus on operational management, resource allocation, and strategic adaptation positions us to thrive in a dynamic business environment, enabling us to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

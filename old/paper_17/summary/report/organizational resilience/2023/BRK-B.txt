Berkshire and its subsidiaries are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could impair business operations, including terrorist acts, cybersecurity risks, geopolitical events, and economic conditions. The organization relies on technology in virtually all aspects of its business, and significant disruptions or failures in technology systems could adversely affect operations and financial condition. Although steps have been taken to mitigate these risks through business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning, a significant disruption could still impact results. The company is dependent on key personnel for major investment and capital allocation decisions, and the potential unavailability of these individuals could materially affect operations. The decentralized business model requires qualified management to navigate changes in business operations due to evolving regulatory environments. The company’s insurance subsidiaries face risks from concentrated equity investments, which could lead to significant declines in statutory surplus and claims-paying ability if market conditions deteriorate. Competition and technological changes may erode competitive advantages, impacting future operating results. The organization’s operating businesses are also affected by economic cycles, with unfavorable conditions potentially leading to reduced earnings and impaired access to capital markets. The outbreak of epidemics or pandemics could adversely affect operations, including disruptions to supply chains and reduced demand for products and services. Regulatory changes in response to economic crises and social issues could impose significant compliance costs, affecting operating results. Climate change poses additional risks, with extreme weather events potentially impacting physical assets and insurance operations. The organization employs disciplined underwriting practices to mitigate potential losses from catastrophic events, but unexpected claims could still arise, impacting financial results. The company’s insurance businesses are subject to regulatory scrutiny, which can affect capital allocation and operational flexibility. The management of Berkshire believes that its decentralized structure and succession planning help mitigate risks associated with key personnel. The organization’s diverse business activities and strong capital base contribute to its resilience in navigating challenging conditions. The company’s ability to absorb strain and maintain operational continuity is critical to its performance under pressure, particularly in the face of external disturbances and market volatility. The management emphasizes the importance of maintaining liquidity and financial strength to support ongoing operations and strategic initiatives. The organization’s capital expenditures and investments in technology and infrastructure are essential for adapting to changing market conditions and ensuring long-term sustainability. Overall, Berkshire's approach to risk management and operational flexibility is integral to its organizational resilience, enabling it to confront adversity and maintain performance amidst uncertainty.

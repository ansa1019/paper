Investing in our securities involves risks, including our ability to grow our business and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We participate in intensely competitive markets, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed. If we fail to innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and customer needs, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed. Disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers' businesses, subject us to substantial liability, and harm our reputation and financial results. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical, particularly in maintaining operational continuity and adapting to unexpected situations. We rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be impacted. Delays in improving our information systems and processes could interfere with our ability to support our existing and growing customer and employee base. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could harm our business, and we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans to mitigate risks. Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our management team, and changes in our management may result in a loss of institutional knowledge. We face ongoing challenges in attracting and retaining top talent, which is critical to our success. Our business operations are subject to interruption by various factors, including climate change, geopolitical instability, and cyberattacks, which could disrupt our ability to deliver services to our customers. We have made significant investments to support our efforts to sell to governmental and heavily-regulated entities, which presents various risks. Our ability to achieve our ESG goals is subject to numerous factors, and our failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations could adversely affect us. We have established compliance programs to mitigate risks associated with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, but there is a risk that our employees or partners could violate these policies. Our customers' business, integration, migration, compliance, and security requirements may cause implementations of our products to be delayed or unsuccessful. We must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products to maintain customer satisfaction and efficiently provide services. Our subscription model makes it difficult to rapidly increase revenues, and we expect our revenue growth rate to decline over the long term. We have historically generated positive operating cash flows, and our working capital requirements are primarily comprised of salaries, bonuses, and benefits for our workforce. We anticipate cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. Our ability to adapt to customer privacy and security requirements is essential as these requirements change over time. We will continue to monitor the direct and indirect impact of macroeconomic events on our business and financial results. Our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives are crucial for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market landscape.

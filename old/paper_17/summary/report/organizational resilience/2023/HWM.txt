Howmet's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors, including cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted global energy markets, leading to high volatility and increasing prices for crude oil, natural gas, and other energy supplies, which result in increases in operating expenses at manufacturing facilities. A material disruption of, or manufacturing difficulties at, Howmet's manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company's ability to meet its obligations to customers. Manufacturing problems arising from equipment failure or inadvertent failure to follow regulatory or customer specifications could have an adverse impact on the company's ability to fulfill orders or meet product quality or performance requirements. Howmet is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for materials and services essential to its operations, and supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the business. The company maintains annual or long-term contracts for a majority of its supply requirements, and supply constraints could impact production or force the company to purchase materials from alternative sources, which may not be available in sufficient quantities or at favorable prices. Howmet's business depends, in part, on its ability to successfully meet program demand, production targets, and commitments, and failure to meet these could have a material adverse effect on the company's reputation and financial condition. The continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the company's growth and business strategy. The loss of key personnel could significantly harm Howmet's business, and any unplanned turnover could deplete the company's institutional knowledge base, resulting in delays or impediments in executing business plans. Howmet's operations are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, which may result in substantial costs and liabilities. The company may also be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, customer, or supplier responses to such change, which could increase production costs or impact demand for certain products. Howmet's global operations expose it to risks that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the market price of its securities. The company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, and increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities pose a risk to the security of its systems and networks. The company's competitive position and future performance depend, in part, on its ability to develop and innovate products, deploy technology initiatives, and implement advanced manufacturing technologies. Howmet's management has continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving operational performance through profitable revenue and efficient operations. The company has aligned its operations consistent with how management assesses operating performance and allocates capital, and management believes that its cash on hand, cash provided from operations, and availability of credit facilities will continue to be sufficient to fund operational and capital allocation activities.

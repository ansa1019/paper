Investing in our securities involves risk, and we may attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent practicable and reasonable, but we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. Difficult market and economic conditions can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. Our investment management and insurance businesses are materially affected by market and economic conditions or events throughout the world, including interest rates, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, and changes in laws. These conditions are often difficult to predict, manage, mitigate, hedge, or foresee. Geopolitical developments and other local and global events outside of our control can materially and adversely impact various aspects of our businesses. The performance and value of our investments, opportunities to make and realize value from our investments, and our ability to find suitable investments are all subject to these external pressures. Natural disasters, public health crises, and potential changes in climate conditions could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our investment management and insurance businesses. Such events may limit or prohibit our ability to conduct investment activities in certain locations, impacting our operational continuity and resilience. 

Our insurance business relies on the ability to attract and retain experienced professionals, and any failure to do so may impair our ability to maintain operations and support growth. We depend on the efforts, skills, reputations, and conduct of our employees, and the loss of key personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors and result in reduced opportunities. The market for talented candidates is highly competitive, and our ability to recruit and retain employees is contingent upon offering attractive compensation and benefits. Our organizational structure and culture are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and resilience, especially during periods of rapid expansion or change. 

We face significant operational risks, including reliance on third-party service providers, which exposes us to potential disruptions that could adversely affect our business continuity. Cybersecurity threats and data breaches are ongoing concerns that could impact our operational integrity and resilience. Our investment strategies may involve complex regulatory requirements and operational challenges, particularly in emerging markets or during periods of market volatility. Changes in regulatory frameworks could impose additional compliance burdens and impact our ability to adapt to new market conditions. 

Our liquidity requirements are significant, and adverse market conditions may affect our sources of liquidity. The inability to meet our liquidity needs could force us to sell assets at unfavorable terms, impacting our financial performance. We also face risks related to the valuation of our investments, which may fluctuate based on market conditions and could lead to significant losses. The interconnectedness of our investments and the complexities of managing them require robust risk management practices to ensure organizational resilience. 

In summary, our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is influenced by various internal and external factors, including market volatility, regulatory changes, and operational risks. The effectiveness of our strategies for risk mitigation, resource allocation, and operational management will be crucial in navigating these challenges and sustaining our organizational health and performance.

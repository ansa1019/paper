Our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our systems, facilities, and business functions and the operation of various third-party systems. An interruption or degradation of service from a third-party system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions. If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies, provide high-quality customer service, or perform other necessary business functions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Catastrophe events that affect one of our larger office locations or critical communications facilities may heighten this risk. Our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our technology systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. Cybersecurity risks rapidly evolve and are complex, so we must continually adapt and enhance our processes and technological defenses. Our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services, which may include technological advances, that are accepted and valued by our customers is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position. If we do not handle these transitions effectively and bring such innovations to market with the requisite speed and agility, the quality of our products and services, our relationships with our customers and agents, and our business prospects may be materially adversely affected. Our ability to attract, develop, and retain talent is critical to our success. Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers, and employees with strong technological, analytical, and other skills necessary for us to run our insurance businesses. Our workplace policies or perceptions of those policies by current and potential employees could impact our ability to attract and retain talent with needed skills. Additionally, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments with reasonable accuracy. Our failure to recognize the need for adjustments could lead to over-staffing or under-staffing in one or more business units. We must maintain a brand and reputation that is recognized and trusted by consumers. Our brand and reputation could be adversely affected by situations that reflect negatively on us, whether due to our business practices, adverse financial developments, or perceptions of our corporate governance. The negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as consumers, regulators, and other stakeholders increase or change their expectations. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics, or other widespread health risks. Any future epidemic, pandemic, or other widespread health risk could exacerbate the impacts of many of the other risk factors described above and adversely affect our business. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs, obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage, and collect under our reinsurance contracts. Our insurance operating results have been and will likely continue to be materially adversely affected by severe weather or other catastrophe events. The frequency, severity, duration, and geographic location and scope of such events are inherently unpredictable. Our ability to manage complexity as we develop and deliver high-quality products and customer experiences is essential. Ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, informational, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and systems. Complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of high-quality products and customer experiences with the speed and agility that may be required.

Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including environmental disruptions and economic conditions that may adversely impact demand for our products. The economic health of our customers is affected by factors such as general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, and consumer confidence, which are outside of our control. Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, negatively impacting our business and financial condition. Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, which could impact our costs and sales. Business interruptions may affect our store hours and the availability of merchandise, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. We rely extensively on various systems to manage inventory and process transactions, and any failure or interruption of these systems could significantly disrupt our operations. Our ability to respond effectively to such disruptions is critical for maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness. We have developed a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure our strategies accordingly. The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, requiring us to adapt to changes in vehicle technology and customer needs. Our strategic initiatives include aggressively opening new stores and enhancing our service offerings, which are essential for maintaining a competitive advantage. We must also manage our relationships with suppliers and ensure their ability to provide quality products at favorable terms, as disruptions in the supply chain could adversely affect our operations. Our success depends on attracting and retaining qualified employees, as their efforts are crucial for executing our strategies and achieving our growth objectives. We face risks associated with future acquisitions that may not lead to expected growth, and we must ensure effective integration of acquired businesses to realize operational benefits. Compliance with legal and regulatory standards is necessary to protect our reputation and avoid potential liabilities. We are committed to preserving and leveraging the value of our brand, as negative publicity could adversely affect our business. Our long-term business strategy requires capital to maintain and enhance our existing stores, invest in new stores, and develop information technology systems. We expect to fund our cash requirements primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings, but we cannot assure that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs is also critical for sustaining our performance under pressure. We continuously assess our self-insurance reserves and long-lived assets for potential impairments, as changes in market conditions could impact our financial health. Overall, our organizational resilience is reflected in our ability to adapt to changing market dynamics, manage risks effectively, and maintain operational flexibility in the face of adversity.

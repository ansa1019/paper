Moody's operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S., including the reform act and the Dodd-Frank act. These regulations are complex, continually evolving, and have tended to become more stringent over time, which may increase the uncertainty regarding potential changes in laws and regulations and the enforcement of any new or existing legislation. The company's compliance and efforts to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties, or other sanctions can result in significant expenses. Moody's faces risks related to financial reforms outside the U.S. affecting the credit rating industry, its businesses, and its customers, which may have a material adverse effect on its operations, profitability, and competitiveness. The company is exposed to legal, economic, operational, and regulatory risks of operating in multiple jurisdictions, which include economic and geopolitical events and market conditions, such as the Russia-Ukraine military conflict and the military conflict in Israel. These events can affect customer retention and demands for products and services. Moody's ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by disruptions in the infrastructure that supports its operations, including physical or technological infrastructure. The company relies on third-party providers to deliver essential services, and any significant failure or compromise of these systems may impair its ability to deliver products and services. Moody's initiatives to reduce costs to counteract a decline in its business may not be sufficient, and cost-reduction initiatives could make it difficult for the company to rapidly expand operations in response to unexpected increases in demand. The company's operations are exposed to risks from infrastructure malfunctions or failures, which may include disruptions involving its electronic delivery systems or data center facilities. The company's extensive controls to reduce the risk of error inherent in operations cannot eliminate such risk completely. Additionally, the company faces exposure to litigation and government regulatory proceedings, investigations, and inquiries related to its ratings actions and other business practices. The evolving expectations on ESG disclosures and reporting could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and new regulatory actions at both corporate and business unit levels. The company is also exposed to risks related to its compliance and risk management programs, which are essential for maintaining operational continuity and organizational resilience. Moody's ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of compliance, review, and reporting systems. The company faces risks related to protecting its intellectual property rights, which could harm its reputation and affect its ability to compete effectively. The introduction of competing products, technologies, or services by other companies can negatively impact the nature and economics of Moody's business, highlighting the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms in adapting to market changes. The company is committed to using its strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while investing in employees and growing the business through targeted initiatives.

Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including social, geopolitical, and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the U.S., and circumstances related to international operations could negatively affect us. Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, local business practices, currency volatility, and compliance with varying regulations may impact our operational flexibility and ability to adapt to changes. Additionally, changes in economic conditions, political instability, public health crises, and access to capital could disrupt our business continuity and affect our ability to recover investments in real estate assets. Our workforce may face challenges that create inefficiencies, delays, or disruptions in our business, particularly during economic downturns or public health crises. Disruptions in global capital and credit markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting our ability to make distributions and payments to security holders. We are also subject to risks associated with compliance with regulatory requirements, which could result in substantial costs and affect our organizational health. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, exposing us to economic downturns in that sector. The attractiveness of our properties and competition from other available properties may affect our ability to lease properties at favorable rates. Our real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful due to risks such as obtaining financing, regulatory approvals, and attracting customer demand. We may face challenges in integrating operations of newly acquired companies, which could hinder our ability to realize anticipated synergies. Our business and operations could suffer from system failures or cybersecurity attacks, which may disrupt our functioning and require additional costs to remedy damages. We carry insurance coverage to mitigate risks associated with property damage and other liabilities, but certain losses may not be fully insured. Our organizational resilience is further challenged by environmental risks, including climate change impacts and the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny. We must maintain sufficient liquidity and manage our debt obligations effectively to ensure operational continuity. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from co-investment ventures, and available financing sources is critical to meeting our anticipated future development and operational needs. We expect to fund our cash needs from net cash flow from property operations, fees earned from services performed, and proceeds from property contributions and dispositions. Our credit ratings affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms, and adverse changes in these ratings could negatively impact our business and growth potential. We continually assess our organizational capabilities and strategic initiatives to enhance our resilience and adaptability in a complex and dynamic business environment.

A significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand. Factors that may affect such demand include the ability and willingness of wireless and cloud service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure, the financial condition of communications service providers, and increased mergers or consolidations that reduce the number of communications service providers. A decrease in demand for wireless or colocation services, including due to general economic conditions, disruption in the financial and credit markets, or global crises, could also impact our operational flexibility and adaptability. Our growth projections are based on future revenue from a small number of customers, and such projections could be adversely impacted by changes in their creditworthiness and financial strength. The current inflationary environment could materially affect our customers through disruptions in their ability to procure equipment, maintain liquidity, and deploy network capital. Problems at our data centers could result in service interruptions or significant infrastructure damage, which could impair our ability to meet service level commitments and adversely affect our organizational health and operational continuity. We must safeguard our customers' infrastructure and ensure our data centers remain operational at all times. Our ongoing contractual revenues may be negatively impacted if a significant number of leases are terminated or not renewed, which could affect our organizational resilience. The emergence of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, and our customers may face new regulatory policies that materially affect their operations. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted return objectives. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their networks, influenced by the growth of wireless services and the financial performance of our tenants. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward. We have master lease agreements with many of our tenants, which provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of non-contractual churn. Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities depends on maintaining recurring revenue and converting it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and achieving operational efficiencies. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants, and a failure by a significant customer to perform could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities, and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, compliance with which is material to understanding our financial results and liquidity. We are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems. Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The requirements of these laws and regulations are complex and could become more stringent in the future, impacting our operational management and organizational effectiveness.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including market fluctuations and economic, political, and other factors that could adversely affect our business continuity and operational flexibility. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, such as geopolitical strain and global health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, is critical for maintaining our organizational resilience. Changes in consumer economic variables and declines in market conditions can impact our ability to achieve strategic objectives and maintain financial health. The interconnectedness of financial institutions means that negative performance or defaults by other entities could expose us to credit losses or disrupt our operations. We continually assess risks and invest in our employees to remain competitive, recognizing that the possibility of increased turnover may impact our ability to attract and retain clients and advisors. Our reputation is one of our most important assets, and damage to it could significantly harm our business and prospects. We have implemented procedures and controls designed to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest, but failures in these areas could adversely affect our organizational coherence and stakeholder engagement. The direct and indirect effects of climate change could also impact our operational management and the resilience of our business practices. Our operational systems and networks are subject to evolving cybersecurity risks, which could result in the loss of proprietary information and damage to our reputation. We rely on third-party service providers for critical business functions, and their operational failures could adversely affect our ability to manage risks and achieve desired outcomes. Risk management policies may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments, which could lead to performance impairment. Our financial performance requires us to develop, manage, and market new products that respond to changes in the industry and evolving client demands. The introduction and maintenance of these products involve substantial risk and uncertainties, including compliance with regulatory requirements. We must manage our business within the expectations of various regulatory frameworks, which may impose capital requirements that affect our ability to pay dividends or return capital from our subsidiaries. The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if they disrupt access to facilities or impact our ability to process transactions. We face risks arising from acquisitions and divestitures, including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our operations and the potential loss of key personnel. Our ability to maintain our financial strength ratings is essential for public confidence in our products and competitive position, as downgrades could lead to reduced sales and increased policy surrenders. We continuously monitor our reserve levels and assumptions regarding future policy benefits, as inadequacies in these areas could adversely impact our financial condition. The management of operational, legal, and regulatory risks requires effective policies and procedures, which may not always be fully effective. Our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through reserves and cash generated by operations, but adverse capital and credit market conditions could limit our ability to meet these needs. We believe that our available capital and liquidity resources are sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term obligations, but we remain vigilant in assessing our risk exposure and the potential impacts of external pressures on our organizational resilience.

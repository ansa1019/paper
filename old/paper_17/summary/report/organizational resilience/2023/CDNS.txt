Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have experienced varied operating results, and our operating results for any particular fiscal period are affected by factors such as the timing of revenue recognition and the mix of products and services sold. Historical results of operations should not be viewed as reliable indicators of future performance. Changes in hardware and IP bookings or deliveries relative to expectations will have a more immediate impact on our revenue. The market environment for hardware and IP is highly competitive, and our customers may choose to purchase competitor products based on cost and performance factors. Uncertainty in the global economy and instability within international relations may negatively impact our business and reduce our bookings levels and revenue. The semiconductor and electronics industries are cyclical and characterized by rapid technological change, which can lead to significant downturns. Adverse developments affecting financial institutions or geopolitical conflicts could result in trade disruptions and negatively impact customer demand. Our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainties, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on our operations. We must comply with various laws and regulations, including those related to export controls, which could impair our ability to compete in global markets. Our business strategy includes investments and acquisitions to enhance our capabilities, but these initiatives may not yield the expected benefits and could disrupt our operations. We rely on our proprietary technology and IP rights, and any infringement claims could harm our business. Cybersecurity risks threaten the confidentiality and integrity of our IT systems, and significant cyberattacks could materially harm our operations. Our international operations are subject to various risks, including trade restrictions and political conditions that could adversely impact our financial condition. We depend on our management team and key employees, and competition for skilled personnel can affect our operational effectiveness. Our ability to attract and retain talent is critical to our success, particularly as we transition employees back to the office. We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial costs in connection with restructuring plans, which may not result in the anticipated benefits. Our cash flows from operating activities are influenced by business levels and customer payment terms, and we expect current cash balances and cash flows will be sufficient to meet our operational needs. We have significant operations outside the United States, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may impact our financial condition. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain hardware components makes us vulnerable to supply disruptions. The long sales cycle of our products may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly. We must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position, and our inability to respond quickly to technological developments could impede our growth. The introduction of new products may reduce demand for older products, and we must support a range of changing customer preferences. Our success depends on our ability to manage these complexities and uncertainties effectively to ensure organizational resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment.

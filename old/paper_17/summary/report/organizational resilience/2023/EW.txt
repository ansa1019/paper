Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty, and the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical for maintaining operational continuity. The failure to successfully innovate and market products could materially affect our prospects, emphasizing the importance of resource allocation and strategic initiatives in adapting to competitive pressures. We face substantial competition and must demonstrate the full value of our differentiated products to healthcare providers and payors to maintain our competitive advantage. The risks associated with public health crises, including pandemics, create pressures on hospital systems and supply chains, which can adversely affect our business and financial condition. Manufacturing, logistics, and quality problems can arise from various factors, including disruptions due to natural disasters or operational errors, highlighting the need for effective crisis management and risk mitigation strategies. Our reliance on third parties for the design, manufacture, and sterilization of products introduces additional risks, as any failure by vendors could result in delays and increased costs. The ability to recruit and retain qualified talent is essential for executing management succession plans and maintaining organizational health. We actively manage a portfolio of research and development products and explore potential acquisitions to enhance our operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of unforeseen challenges. The planned spin-off of our critical care product group aims to sharpen focus and increase flexibility, allowing for a more strategic response to market demands. Our commitment to developing innovative technologies is reflected in our significant investments in research and development, which are essential for maintaining our position in a highly competitive market. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to affect our operations, necessitating a proactive approach to managing resources and adapting to changing market conditions. We expect to experience adverse effects related to these challenges as hospital systems rebalance their infrastructure and resources. Our operational management strategies are designed to ensure that we can confront and recover from unexpected situations while maintaining performance under pressure. We are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality-of-life evidence to encourage the adoption of innovative medical therapies, which is critical for our long-term success. The complex regulatory environment in which we operate requires us to remain vigilant in compliance and risk assessment, as failures in these areas could have significant implications for our business. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is vital for our organizational resilience, allowing us to navigate the multifaceted challenges posed by the competitive landscape and external disturbances. The integration of strategic tools and mechanisms for performance maintenance is essential for fostering a culture of organizational learning and agility, enabling us to adapt to environmental perturbations and ensure sustainable growth.

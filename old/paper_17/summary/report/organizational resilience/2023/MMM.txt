The company's results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other external conditions, which can create pressures that challenge organizational resilience. The company derives approximately 54 percent of its revenues from outside the United States, making its operations subject to global competition and economic risks beyond its control, including disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, military conflicts, and public health emergencies. These external pressures could adversely affect the company's business and supply chain, necessitating effective risk mitigation strategies and adaptability to maintain operational continuity. The company has faced significant litigation and regulatory scrutiny related to certain fluorochemicals, which may require additional actions, including investigation, remediation, and compliance, impacting its organizational health and operational flexibility. The evolving regulatory landscape surrounding perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has led the company to announce plans to exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, reflecting a strategic response to external pressures and a commitment to sustainability. The company continues to evaluate the availability of third-party products that do not contain PFAS, demonstrating an adaptive strategy in response to changing customer needs and regulatory demands. The company's operational execution, including organizational restructurings and the ability to adapt to business model changes, is crucial for maintaining performance under pressure and achieving its major objectives. The company has implemented various tools, such as continuous improvement initiatives, to enhance productivity and reduce expenses, which are essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring resilience. The company's reliance on information technology systems and the potential for cybersecurity incidents pose risks that could disrupt operations and impact organizational effectiveness. The company is also subject to risks related to international laws and regulations, which could lead to liabilities and affect its ability to execute its strategy. The planned spin-off of the health care business introduces additional challenges that could impact the company's relationships with stakeholders and its overall performance. The company has recognized the importance of maintaining strong investment-grade ratings to facilitate access to capital markets, which is vital for resource generation and strategic initiatives. The ability to manage currency risks through natural and financial hedges is part of the company's strategy to reduce volatility and enhance resilience in a turbulent market environment. The companyâ€™s commitment to ongoing investments in research and development is aimed at fostering innovation and adapting to disruptive changes in the competitive landscape. Overall, the company's multifaceted approach to managing external pressures, operational challenges, and strategic initiatives reflects its focus on sustaining organizational resilience and achieving long-term success.

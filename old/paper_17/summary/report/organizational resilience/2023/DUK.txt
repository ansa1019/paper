Duke Energy's future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy, including achieving its carbon emissions reduction goals. The company’s clean energy transition is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, economic, and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control and may challenge its ability to meet customer expectations of reliability in a carbon-constrained environment. The approval of state regulators is necessary for the company to continue to retire existing carbon-emitting assets or make investments in new generating capacity. The company may be constrained by its ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price and to construct projects on time. Regulatory, legislative, and legal risks could limit Duke Energy's ability to recover costs, which may negatively impact earnings. The company’s regulated utility revenues and earnings depend on state legislation and regulation affecting electric generation, transmission, and distribution, which may limit their ability to recover costs. Changes in regulation could also result in generation facilities being retired earlier than planned to meet net-zero goals. The company’s results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic, and other conditions beyond its control, including declines in demand for electricity or natural gas due to economic downturns. Adverse economic conditions could negatively impact the financial stability of certain customers, resulting in increased bad debt expense and higher allowances for doubtful accounts. The company actively works to manage and maintain prices at lower levels despite increased commodity prices and has made substantial progress in recovering deferred fuel costs. Duke Energy’s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including information technology systems that support business processes. The company believes that digital transformation is key to driving internal efficiencies and providing additional capabilities to customers. The company’s ability to execute its strategy and achieve anticipated financial outcomes is influenced by the expectations of customers, regulators, investors, and stakeholders. Failure to meet these expectations may impact Duke Energy's reputation and its ability to achieve favorable outcomes in future rate cases. The company recognizes the importance of modernizing the electric grid to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, which improves reliability and flexibility. Investments in grid resiliency and infrastructure are critical for maintaining operational continuity and performance under pressure. Duke Energy's response to macroeconomic headwinds demonstrates its commitment to operational flexibility and strategic adaptation. The company continues to enhance its customer experience through data-driven approaches and has established a bulk electric system oversight board to ensure energy adequacy. The company’s strategic initiatives include leveraging new technology and digital tools to navigate a transforming landscape while maintaining affordability and reliability for customers. The steps taken to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric transmission and distribution systems and natural gas facilities include modernizing the grid and applying lessons learned from previous storms.

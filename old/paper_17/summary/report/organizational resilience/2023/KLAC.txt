We are exposed to risks associated with a weakening in the condition of the financial markets and the global economy, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are unable to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Managing global operations presents challenges, including political and social attitudes, laws, regulations, and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies. We are continuously assessing the aggregate potential impact of existing regulations on our financial results and operations, particularly in light of trade restrictions that could significantly disrupt our global operations. Disruptions due to climate change, natural disasters, or public health crises could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries, or loss of customers. Our operations are subject to disruption for various reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, and other catastrophic events. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of risks, but certain risks are uninsurable or can only be mitigated at significant cost. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We depend on secure information technology for our business and are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents affecting our systems and networks. Cybersecurity incidents could impact our business directly or indirectly by affecting third parties in the supply chain, resulting in disruptions to operations, misappropriation of confidential information, and reputational damage. Our ability to effectively develop and manage outsourcing strategies is crucial, as disruptions or delays at third-party service providers could adversely impact our operations. We are also exposed to risks related to our highly concentrated customer base, where orders from a limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of our sales. This concentration increases the impact that future business or technology changes may have on our financial condition and operating results. Our success depends on our ability to attract, onboard, and retain key personnel, as competition for qualified personnel is intense. We have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws, but there can be no assurance that these will be completely effective. Our performance may be subject to greater scrutiny as a result of our announcement of any goals or policies, and we may face pressure from external sources to adopt more aggressive initiatives. The complexity and evolving nature of regulations increase our risk of non-compliance, which could result in significant penalties and reputational harm. Our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to changing market conditions is essential for organizational resilience. We must continue to make substantial investments in research and development to enhance our product offerings and maintain a competitive advantage. The ongoing changes in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, expose our business to significant risks, and our ability to respond to these changes is critical for sustaining growth and resilience.

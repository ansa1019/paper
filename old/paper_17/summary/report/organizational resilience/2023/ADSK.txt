We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. Our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance, costs related to product defects, and large expenditures. The software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving customer requirements, necessitating constant evaluation of our business model and strategy to maintain operational flexibility. We are focused on providing solutions that enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects. If we are unable to provide timely and cost-effective enhancements that achieve market acceptance, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Our executive management team must act quickly and with vision in response to rapidly changing customer expectations and technological advancements. Global economic and political conditions may further impact our industries, business, and financial results. The extent to which these challenges will impact our financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain and will depend on various factors, including actions taken by governments and businesses in response to these challenges. Our dependency on international revenue exposes us to significant international regulatory, economic, and political risks, which could adversely impact our financial results. We may not be successful in overcoming risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments, which include integration difficulties, exposure to litigation, and the potential for incompatible business cultures. Our reliance on third parties for operational and technical services introduces additional risks, particularly related to cybersecurity incidents that could compromise the integrity of our systems and data. We have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potential impact of catastrophic events, but there can be no assurance that these plans would enable us to return to normal business operations. Our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure. The failure of our systems due to catastrophic events could adversely impact our business and financial condition. We are committed to advancing a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable world, focusing our efforts on energy and materials, health and resilience, and work and prosperity. Our strategy includes building a trusted design and make platform that connects people through automation, data, and insights to help achieve better outcomes for businesses and society. We aim to centralize critical capabilities across key offerings and have invested in AI to enhance our solutions. Our ability to adapt our business model to meet customer requirements is critical for our growth strategy, particularly in transitioning customers to our cloud-based offerings. We face significant challenges in managing our use of AI and ensuring its effective integration into our products, as well as navigating the evolving landscape of privacy, data protection, and information security regulations. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties may also impact our operational continuity and overall performance.

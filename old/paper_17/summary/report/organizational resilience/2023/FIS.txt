We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including cybersecurity threats that could disrupt delivery of services and damage our reputation. The uninterrupted operation of information systems is critical to our functioning, and security or privacy breaches are principal operational risks. We must enhance our ability to manage risks from the diversity in potential security attacks. Our business is characterized by constant technological changes and evolving industry standards, necessitating our ability to innovate and adapt solutions to meet changing demands. Failure to innovate could result in losing clients or difficulty attracting new ones. The markets for our solutions are intensely competitive, and we face direct competition from third parties and in-house capacities of potential clients. Economic conditions, geopolitical conflicts, and consumer confidence may adversely affect demand for our services and financial performance. Lengthening sales cycles and rising inflation have negatively impacted our results, and any prolonged adverse economic conditions could materially affect our business. Consolidation in the banking and financial services industry reduces our number of potential clients, increasing dependency on a limited client base. Failure to obtain new clients or renew contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial condition. Business interruptions, errors, or failures in technology systems could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses. We are exposed to risks from international operations, including currency fluctuations and compliance with diverse regulations. Our compliance with evolving cybersecurity and privacy laws is critical, and failure to meet these requirements could result in penalties and reputational damage. The increasing complexity of regulatory compliance may require additional capital investments and impact our operational efficiency. We are also subject to risks associated with strategic acquisitions and divestitures, which may not yield anticipated benefits and could divert management's attention. Our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations relies on skilled professionals, and competition for such talent is intense. The loss of senior management could adversely impact our strategic direction and operational effectiveness. We are involved in various legal proceedings that could negatively affect our financial condition. The direct and indirect effects of climate change and increased regulatory scrutiny could disrupt our operations. Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain talent, particularly in technology and senior management roles. We continue to invest in modernization and innovation to meet market demands and enhance our capabilities. Our integrated solutions are well-positioned to address outsourcing trends across the markets we serve. We seek to mitigate risks from industry consolidation by offering competitive solutions and adapting to the evolving needs of financial institutions. The occurrence of adverse events, including cyberattacks and geopolitical conflicts, could have significant implications for our business continuity and operational resilience. We are committed to enhancing our operational flexibility and strategic response capabilities to navigate complex and uncertain environments effectively.

Our business activities are subject to significant risks, including those related to external pressures and environmental perturbations that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. The company faces risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could significantly disrupt operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and financial conditions. The global covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted our operations in 2020 and 2021, resulting in temporary decreases in production at certain sites. We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, and social or community disputes. The occurrence of these events may result in work stoppages, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations, and financial position. 

Our operations are also subject to risks associated with the transportation, storage, handling, and use of explosives and hazardous chemicals, which include unplanned detonation of explosives and catastrophic release of hazardous chemicals. We rely on our supply chain operations to procure goods and services, and competition with other natural resource companies may adversely affect our operations and development projects. Production continuity can be impacted by risks associated with the management and operation of the company's inbound global supply chain, including material availability, disruption, and performance risks. The mining industry has been impacted by increased demand for critical resources, which can result in cost increases and delays in construction of projects, thereby impacting operating costs and production schedules.

We are dependent upon our employees being able to perform their jobs in a safe and respectful work environment, and our business depends on good relations with our employees. Labor disputes or other employee actions could adversely affect us. The company has implemented a new employment model in Ghana, converting permanent employees into two-year fixed-term contracts, which has led to union requests for bargaining rights. The negotiation and review of agreements with local communities involve complicated and sensitive issues, and failure to manage these relationships may lead to local dissatisfaction, resulting in interruptions to our operations.

Newmont's sustainability strategy is foundational to achieving its purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. The company is committed to implementing the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management by 2025, and compliance with environmental regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens. The company also faces risks related to transitioning its business to meet regulatory, societal, and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy, which may require significant investment and entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes. 

The company's ability to achieve its operational goals depends on recruiting, hiring, retaining, and developing qualified personnel. The evolving expectations related to human rights and environmental protections may result in opposition to our current and future operations, potentially requiring modifications to or precluding the operation or development of our projects. The company's financial position could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including increased taxes and royalties, nationalization of mining assets, and increased labor regulations.

The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, particularly as we face strong competition from other retailers and evolving consumer preferences. Our strategy, which includes investments in ecommerce and technology, may not adequately allow us to continue to grow our ecommerce business or maintain our overall market position. The success of this strategy depends on our ability to deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and to adapt to changes in customer perceptions and behaviors. Failure to effectively respond to consumer trends could negatively affect our relationship with customers and demand for our products. Additionally, disruptions in supply chain operations, including those caused by global health pandemics or natural disasters, could adversely affect our financial performance. Our operations are also subject to various external pressures, including economic conditions, geopolitical events, and climate change, which may impact our ability to maintain operational continuity and resilience. 

We are committed to preserving our reputation, which is impacted by public perceptions and negative incidents involving our workforce or business practices. The complexity of our fulfillment and technology networks increases the challenges of operating effectively, particularly as we add new fulfillment centers. Our ability to manage risks associated with our suppliers and to ensure compliance with applicable laws is critical to our operational effectiveness. The emergence of cybersecurity threats poses additional risks to our information systems, which are essential for conducting business and maintaining customer trust. 

We continuously assess our organizational capabilities and the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives to ensure we are prepared for unexpected situations. Our focus on operational flexibility and resource allocation is vital for adapting to environmental perturbations and maintaining performance under pressure. The integration of technology into our operations is intended to enhance our resilience and ability to respond to disruptions. Moreover, our commitment to learning and innovation is fundamental to navigating the complexities of the retail landscape and sustaining competitive advantage.

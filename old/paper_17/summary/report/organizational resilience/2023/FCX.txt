This report contains forward-looking statements regarding our potential future performance, operations, and projects, emphasizing our commitment to deliver responsibly produced copper and molybdenum, including plans to implement, validate, and maintain validation of our operating sites under specific frameworks. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially due to various risks. Our operations are subject to significant operational risks, including environmental challenges and the ability to smelt and refine, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and cash flows. The management of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety, and engineering challenges that could impact our organizational resilience. We recognize the importance of maintaining good relations with our workforce and the potential for labor disputes or unrest to disrupt operations. Our business depends on our ability to recruit, retain, develop, and advance qualified personnel, and labor shortages at our North America operations represent strategic challenges that could impact productivity and efficiency. We have faced operational risks inherent in mining, including the ability to smelt and refine, as well as environmental, safety, and engineering challenges associated with the management of waste rock and tailings. Our operations are also impacted by geopolitical, economic, regulatory, and social risks, particularly in international markets, which may affect our ability to operate effectively and maintain our competitive advantage. We are engaged in various studies associated with potential future expansion projects and have made significant investments in our domestic smelting and refining capacity, which are crucial for our operational continuity and resilience. Our financial policy is aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining a solid balance sheet and providing cash returns to shareholders while advancing opportunities for future growth. We believe that our actions taken in recent years to build a solid balance sheet and maintain flexible organic growth options will allow us to continue executing our business plans prudently during periods of economic uncertainty. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical, and we are focused on enhancing our organizational capabilities through strategic initiatives and operational flexibility. We are also advancing plans to transition our energy sources to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is part of our commitment to sustainability and organizational health. Our operations are subject to extensive and complex environmental laws and regulations, and compliance with these laws is integral to our business. We are committed to improving our resilience strategies and mechanisms to address the challenges posed by environmental perturbations and other external pressures. The physical impacts of climate change may adversely affect our operations, workforce, and supply chains, necessitating proactive measures to enhance our adaptability and ensure long-term sustainability. We continue to monitor market conditions and will adjust our operating plans to protect liquidity and preserve our asset values, ensuring our organizational strength and resilience in the face of future challenges.

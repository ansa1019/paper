In addition to the other information set forth in this 2023 annual report, any of the factors described below could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity, which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline. The animal health industry is highly competitive, and many competitors may have access to greater financial, marketing, technical, and other resources or have significant market share in particular areas. As a result, they may be able to devote more resources to developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling their products, which could lead to a decrease in our revenue and profitability. Our results of operations are dependent upon the success of our top-selling products, and any issues with these products could have a more significant impact on our results. Macroeconomic, business, political, and financial disruptions, including public health crises or pandemics, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. Economic downturns could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products. Furthermore, economic concerns and geopolitical instability may cause shortages in veterinary healthcare workers or reduce pet owners' willingness to treat health conditions. Adverse weather events and natural disasters may also interfere with operations at our manufacturing sites and negatively impact our livestock customers. Climate change could disrupt our and our customers' businesses, with potential physical risks including altered rainfall distribution, prolonged droughts, and increased frequency of natural disasters. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain and hire executive officers or other key personnel, as our ability to recruit and retain talent is influenced by various factors, including compensation and work environment. We may also experience difficulties or delays in the development and commercialization of new products, which subjects us to inherent risks and uncertainties. Our research and development efforts enable us to deliver innovative products to address unmet needs and evolve our product lines, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. The diversity of our product portfolio and global operations provides stability to our overall business, as impacts on revenue from disease outbreaks or weather conditions in a particular market are often offset by increased sales in other regions. We believe that our investments in one of the industry's largest sales organizations and our high-quality manufacturing contribute to enduring and valued relationships with our customers. Our strategic initiatives aim to improve our ability to predict and manage resources effectively, ensuring operational flexibility and responsiveness to emerging themes or priorities. We actively review and manage our resources and continuously improve key operational processes to enhance our organizational resilience. The unpredictability of a product's regulatory or commercial success or failure, along with shifting customer demand, increases the potential for capacity imbalances, which could adversely affect our operating results. The ability to maintain operational continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions is critical for our organizational health and success.

Truist anticipates further integration of systems, operations, and personnel of BB&T and SunTrust over the next couple of years, with the successful integration depending substantially on the company's ability to consolidate operations, management teams, corporate cultures, systems, and procedures. Integration activities have and will continue to divert resources from regular operations, and general market and economic conditions may inhibit the company's successful integration of these entities. The company has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, but there can be no assurance that such plans will be effective. Truist's framework for managing risks may not be effective, and the company is at risk of increased losses from fraud and operational or security systems failures, which could disrupt business and adversely impact results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. The company relies on the expertise of key personnel, and if these individuals leave or change roles without effective replacements, operations may suffer. Truist's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss, but it may not fully identify and mitigate risk exposure in all market environments. The company has established policies and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity, credit, market, operational, technology, reputational, legal, model, and compliance risk. Truist's ability to access short-term funding could be materially impaired by general market disruptions or operational problems affecting third parties. The company's liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access short-term funding or unforeseen cash outflows, and the loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase funding costs. Truist's liquidity management includes maintaining a liquid asset buffer of cash and highly liquid unencumbered securities. The ability to raise funding at competitive prices is affected by the rating agencies' views of the company's credit quality, liquidity, capital, and earnings. The company has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. Truist's risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite, and the company is committed to fostering a culture that supports the identification and escalation of risks across the organization. Management's capital deployment plan prioritizes organic growth, dividends, and strategic opportunities, and the company intends to maintain capital at levels that will result in classification as "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes. Truist's operational flexibility is essential for adapting to changing market conditions and ensuring business continuity, especially in the face of external pressures such as economic downturns and the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company actively manages credit exposures impacted by the pandemic and is committed to supporting clients through various assistance programs. The integration of systems and operations, along with effective risk management and resource allocation, will be critical for Truist's organizational resilience and long-term success.

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and our business could be harmed if any of these risks materialize. The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have an adverse impact on our near-term revenues, principally due to lower auction inventories and reduced accident volume as miles driven dramatically declined in response to shelter-in-place orders. We cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop or the extent to which it may have longer-term unanticipated impacts on our markets, including the risk of long-term reductions in miles driven. Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if the pandemic results in declines in the number of vehicles we process. Although we have been deemed an "essential business" and largely continued operations, we have made adjustments in our business processes that may reduce efficiency or increase operating expenses. We expect the pandemic to adversely affect our quarterly revenues in future quarters, with the magnitude and timing of these effects dependent upon the extent and duration of suspended economic activity across our markets. Our expansion into international markets exposes us to risks arising from operating in those regions, and any failure to successfully integrate businesses acquired or operational capabilities established outside the U.S. could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. We have incurred substantial expenses establishing new yards and operations, and we cannot predict whether the deployment of our proprietary auction technologies will be successful or result in increases in revenues or operating efficiencies. Our operations are subject to various risks associated with managing and staffing foreign offices, increased travel and legal compliance costs, and adapting to different business cultures. Our success will depend on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated adjustments in our operations to ensure business continuity, and we have mobilized resources to respond to adverse conditions, such as natural disasters. Our ability to manage growth depends on our capacity to hire, train, and manage additional qualified personnel and establish new relationships with vehicle sellers. We face significant competition for the supply of salvage vehicles and buyers, and our ability to compete successfully may be affected by the competitive landscape. We have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations, but our operations may still be exposed to political, regulatory, and reputational risks. The integration of acquired businesses and the establishment of new relationships with buyers and sellers are critical for our operational flexibility and overall performance. Our business is also influenced by macroeconomic factors, including fluctuations in commodity prices and vehicle-related technological advancements, which can impact our revenues and growth rates. We continuously evaluate our capacity in all markets and seek to increase capacity through acquisitions, but zoning restrictions may limit our ability to expand. Our operational and financial performance may fluctuate due to various factors, including changes in accident rates, market demand, and the overall economic environment. We have developed a new proprietary enterprise operating system to address our international expansion needs, but the ongoing design and implementation carry risks that could disrupt our operations. Our success depends on maintaining the integrity of our systems and infrastructure, and any failure to do so may result in loss of customers and adverse effects on our financial position.

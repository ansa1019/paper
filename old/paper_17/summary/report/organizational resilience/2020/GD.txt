An investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability, and quality of commodities and subsystems. Our revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government, which involves specific risks, including the potential for decreases in U.S. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation that could impact our financial performance. U.S. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay, which can affect our ability to perform on our contracts. The annual budget process may be delayed or disrupted, potentially impacting funding for our programs and the timing of new awards. Our contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings. We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audits by the U.S. government, which can result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed. The business environment is influenced by changing customer demand and economic conditions, which can complicate our ability to adapt and respond effectively to disruptions. Our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet customer needs. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to our operations, affecting our ability to perform on contracts and resulting in increased costs that may not be fully recoverable. We have implemented measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, modified work locations and schedules, and coordinated closely with suppliers and customers to mitigate disruptions. Our business continuity programs have been instituted to manage the impact of the pandemic, and we continue to assess the benefits and limitations of actions taken by the U.S. government to support economic activity. We believe that our cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity are sufficient to support our short- and long-term liquidity needs. The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by military funding priorities and our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment. We expect our investment in the development of new aircraft products and technologies to support long-term growth. Our total backlog increased, reflecting significant contract awards, and we have taken actions to strengthen our liquidity and financial condition in response to the pandemic. We continue to assess potential consequences to our employees, business, supply chain, and customers, and take actions to mitigate adverse outcomes. The evolving nature of cybersecurity threats poses additional risks to our operations, and we maintain information security staff and procedures to manage these risks. Our ability to perform our obligations may be adversely affected if suppliers are unable to provide materials or services in a timely manner. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain, and we will continue to adapt our strategies to ensure operational continuity and resilience in the face of these challenges.

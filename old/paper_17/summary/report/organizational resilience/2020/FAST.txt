Our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The material risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or negatively affect our operating results and profitability include potential material liability linked to the use of our products by customers, particularly in challenging industries where there is a material risk of catastrophic events. We maintain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of this risk, but could experience significant losses if adequate insurance is not in place or if our insurers are unable to satisfy their obligations. Interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations, cause unanticipated increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues, and result in less efficient operations. Our information systems are critical to many aspects of our business, and we could be adversely affected if we experience a disruption or data loss and are unable to recover in a timely manner. We have taken significant steps to protect customer and confidential information, but the possibility of cybersecurity incidents cannot be eliminated entirely. Regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies handle personal data, and new privacy security laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs. Our sales growth is dependent on our ability to attract new customers and increase activity with existing customers, and we have increased resources devoted to growth drivers. However, the COVID-19 pandemic created an environment not conducive to the level of signings we would have expected under normal conditions, impacting our growth drivers and overall sales. We have experienced strong demand for personal protection equipment (PPE) and sanitation products during the pandemic, which has generated significant sales. The pandemic has also produced shifts in our business mix, affecting our gross profit margins. Our ability to adapt to these changes and maintain operational continuity is essential for our organizational resilience. We have taken steps to safeguard the health of our employees and ensure our operations function effectively, including closing facilities to outside personnel and adjusting work schedules. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for effective crisis management and has required us to monitor the situation actively, potentially altering our business operations as required. Our competitive advantage in industrial vending and bin stock tools could be impacted by the loss of key suppliers or if customers shift focus to short-term disruptions rather than long-term strategic planning. We believe our ability to grow is amplified if we can serve our customers at the closest economic point of contact. Our focus centers on understanding our customers' needs and obstacles, which is critical for maintaining organizational effectiveness and adapting to market changes. The industrial, construction, and maintenance supply industry is consolidating, which could increase competition and impact our market share and operating income. Disruptions in our distribution system due to inclement weather or other factors could adversely affect our ability to maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to customers on time. The ability to identify new products and integrate them into our selling locations is vital for sustaining our competitive edge and responding to customer needs effectively.

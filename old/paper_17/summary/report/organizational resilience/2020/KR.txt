The operating environment for the food retailing industry continues to be characterized by intense price competition, expansion, and increasing fragmentation of retail and online formats, which necessitates a strong capacity for adaptation to evolving customer preferences. If we do not appropriately or accurately anticipate customer preferences or fail to quickly adapt to these changing preferences, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Our ecosystem monetizes the traffic and data insights generated by our enhanced customer experience, which reflects our commitment to operational flexibility and innovation. We must anticipate and meet these evolving customer preferences and continue to implement technology, software, and processes to fulfill customer orders conveniently and cost-effectively. The nature and extent to which our competitors respond to the evolving competitive landscape could adversely affect our profitability, highlighting the need for strategic initiatives that enhance our resilience. Providing flexible fulfillment options and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet customer preferences, indicating the importance of organizational capabilities in navigating these challenges. Our digital business accelerated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating our ability to pivot quickly and effectively to meet customer demand for safe, low-touch shopping modalities. The pandemic has underscored the importance of safeguarding our associates and customers, leading to significant investments to ensure operational continuity and resilience. We have implemented numerous safety and cleanliness processes in our stores and facilities, which are critical for maintaining customer trust and operational integrity. The increase in digital revenue during the pandemic reflects our successful adaptation strategies and the proactive measures taken to enhance our competitive position. Our financial model is underpinned by our leading position in food, and we continue to invest in areas that matter most to our customers, which is essential for driving sales growth and sustaining our business. The ongoing contributions of our associates, including members of senior management, are vital for navigating the complexities of our evolving business environment. We must recruit, hire, develop, and retain qualified associates to meet the demands of our increasingly complex operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened various risks, including supply chain disruptions and changes in consumer behavior, which necessitate a robust crisis management framework. Our ability to maintain financial flexibility during such disruptions is crucial for long-term sustainability and success. We are committed to maintaining our net debt to adjusted EBITDA range to ensure we can respond effectively to competitive conditions and external pressures. Our strategic planning includes evaluating potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans, which could impact our financial condition and necessitate proactive measures to stabilize future associate benefits. The resilience demonstrated through our response to the pandemic and our ongoing investments in technology and customer engagement strategies positions us favorably for future growth and adaptation to market changes.

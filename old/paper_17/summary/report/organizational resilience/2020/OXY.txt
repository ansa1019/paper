The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected Occidental's business and the ultimate effect on its operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. The pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, business closures, and other restrictions on movement, leading to a significant reduction in demand for and prices of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas. If the reduced demand persists, Occidental's operations, financial condition, cash flows, and the quantity of estimated proved reserves may be materially and adversely affected. The extent to which the pandemic adversely affects business operations will depend on the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities. Occidental has implemented workplace restrictions for health and safety reasons and continues to monitor government directives. The company has taken significant measures to increase its liquidity and address near-term debt maturities in response to the dramatic drop in oil prices and the current macroeconomic environment. Actions include reducing the capital budget, cutting operating costs, and divesting non-core assets. Occidental's business plan includes strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and maintaining a robust liquidity position. The company has also hedged a portion of its expected production to enhance cash flow stability, which reflects a proactive approach to risk management and resource allocation. The long-term effects of economic conditions and commodity pricing volatility could adversely affect Occidental's financial condition and operational capabilities. The company is focused on maximizing shareholder returns through capital efficiency and prioritizing projects that decrease its carbon footprint. Occidental's strategies are subject to business, economic, and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control. The company's ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical for maintaining operational continuity and achieving major objectives. The organizationâ€™s resilience is reflected in its commitment to sustainability, health, safety, and environmental responsibility, as well as in its efforts to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions. Occidental's operational management emphasizes the importance of strategic foresight and the ability to navigate complex situations, ensuring that the company remains competitive in a turbulent market. The organization recognizes the need for inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement to enhance its resilience strategies and mechanisms. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is essential for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. As Occidental continues to evaluate the impact of new regulations and market dynamics, its focus remains on leveraging its strengths and capabilities to sustain performance and drive future growth.

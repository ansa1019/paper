The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The pandemic has contributed to widespread changes to, and significant reductions in, household and business activity and consumer and business spending, as well as economic concerns and a rise in unemployment. These conditions have increased strain on our risk management policies, including the effectiveness and accuracy of our models, given the lack of data inputs and comparable precedent. Difficult conditions in the business and economic environment have had and are expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have focused on supporting our colleagues and customers, protecting our brand, and structuring the company for growth in the future while remaining financially strong. Our colleague base has successfully operated in a mostly remote working environment, ensuring that they have the flexibility and resources needed to stay safe, healthy, and productive. We have offered financial and other assistance to our customers and merchants, reflecting our commitment to service excellence. The resilience of our differentiated business model, which includes a loyal and diverse customer base, a valued brand, and our global merchant network, provides us with a solid foundation as we move forward. Throughout 2020, we have made substantial progress on our priorities to manage through this period of uncertainty. We have experienced lower voluntary attrition rates on our proprietary products compared to the prior year, and our card members have recognized our commitment to service excellence. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of operational flexibility and adaptability in response to unexpected situations. Our business continuity efforts have included increased spending on technology and service centers, as well as readiness efforts for returning to our offices. The increased risk of significantly higher card member reimbursements for goods or services purchased from merchants that cease operations has also been a concern. We have seen steady improvement in our overall billed business, with different recovery trends in travel and entertainment (T&E) and non-T&E spending. The resilience strategies we have implemented, including enhancing our value propositions and supporting small merchants, have been critical in navigating the challenges posed by the pandemic. Our risk management framework seeks to identify and mitigate risk while appropriately balancing risk and return. The management of our risks depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models, and we have developed systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incidents. Our operational risk management process is designed to measure and manage risks associated with inadequate or failed processes, people, or information systems. We have also focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position to meet our financial obligations and business requirements, ensuring that we can adapt to changing market conditions. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes has been essential for our organizational resilience, allowing us to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

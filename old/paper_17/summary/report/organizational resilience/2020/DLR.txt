Our business and operations, and our customers, suppliers, and business partners may be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks. Such events could materially and adversely impact our operations and the rental revenue we generate from our agreements with our customers or could result in defaults by our customers. We have instituted policies requiring employees to work remotely in certain cases, which may impact their productivity. We may continue to experience delays in construction activity due to increased safety protocols implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business depends upon the demand for data centers, and a reduction in this demand would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We face significant competition, which may adversely affect the occupancy and rental rates of our data centers. Any failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions. We may be vulnerable to breaches or unauthorized access to our physical and information security infrastructure and systems, which could result in interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Our international activities subject us to risks different than those we face in the United States, and we may not be able to effectively manage our international business. The global impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our ability to adapt to changing technologies and customer requirements is critical, as our data center infrastructure may become obsolete. We depend on significant customers, and many of our data centers are single-tenant properties, which increases our vulnerability to their financial health. Our ability to attract, grow, and retain a diverse and balanced customer base is essential for maximizing revenues. We may not be able to lease vacant or development space, renew leases, or re-lease space as leases expire, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Our portfolio is geographically concentrated, and downturns in local economic conditions could materially adversely affect our operations and revenue. We may experience supply chain or procurement disruptions, which could impact our ability to meet delivery timelines. The technology industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer requirements, and our inability to adapt to these changes could adversely impact our business. We are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure, and our growth depends on external sources of capital, which are outside of our control. Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed, and we may have difficulty managing our growth. We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities, including refinancing and interest rate risks. Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected by various factors, including our inability to manage our growth effectively and our reliance on third-party suppliers for power. Our ability to maintain operational continuity and respond to crises is essential for our organizational resilience.

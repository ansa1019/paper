The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted our business, leading to operational disruptions and necessitating measures to protect the health and safety of our employees while maintaining business operations. We have taken additional measures and incurred expenses to comply with government requirements and safety guidance, which may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employee base. A significant number of employees continue to work remotely, which presents increased risks of adverse effects on our business due to potential cybersecurity risks and disruptions to our technology infrastructure. Our business operations could be significantly disrupted if key facilities experience closures or worker shortages due to COVID-19. Cost management actions implemented in response to the pandemic could hinder the execution of our business strategy, including deferring planned capital expenditures. We rely on a global workforce and must effectively manage our employees to ensure operational continuity amidst these challenges. Our ability to attract, retain, and develop high-caliber talent is critical for driving business growth and profitability, and difficulties in securing the supply of raw materials or fluctuations in their costs could materially affect our operations. Severe public health outbreaks, including COVID-19, could adversely impact our business by causing significant downturns in key industries we serve. We continue to execute key business initiatives, including restructurings and investments in business systems, to improve efficiency and returns. The Accelerate 2020 plan aims to simplify and automate processes, reduce complexity, and focus on long-term growth areas. Our growth depends on our ability to compete successfully with respect to value, innovation, and customer support, and we must continue to identify and commercialize innovative products. The uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to predict future developments and their impact on our business. We have taken steps to drive revenue growth through new products and programs while implementing cost-saving initiatives. Our overall success as a global business depends on our ability to navigate differing economic, social, legal, and political conditions, and we may not continue to succeed in developing effective policies and strategies in each location where we operate. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of organizational resilience, as we adapt to changing circumstances and seek to maintain operational flexibility and performance under pressure. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure we can respond effectively to future challenges.

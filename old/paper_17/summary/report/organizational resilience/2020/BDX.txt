An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with public health threats such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable. We experienced significant reductions in the demand for certain of our products due to reductions in elective and non-essential procedures, lower utilization of routine testing, and decreased research activity due to laboratory closures. While we undertook certain financing activities as a precautionary measure during this economic slowdown, no assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets in the future without incurring significant costs and expenses. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows is dependent on future developments, which are uncertain at this time. In response to the pandemic, we developed and launched multiple products for the detection and identification of COVID-19, demonstrating our ability to adapt and innovate under challenging conditions. We have enacted business continuity plans to ensure operational continuity and have not experienced significant disruptions to our operations and supply chain to date. Our financial position has remained strong, and we continue to generate operating cash flows sufficient to meet our short-term liquidity needs. We believe that given our debt ratings and capital allocation strategy, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. Our ability to sustain long-term growth will depend on various factors, including our ability to expand our core business, develop innovative new products, and improve operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. We are focused on creating more resilient operations based on an enterprise-wide renewable energy strategy and enhancing our quality and risk management systems. The medical technology industry is very competitive, and our ability to compete is impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements, including increased demand for environmentally-friendly products and products incorporating digital capabilities. We are also subject to rapid technological change and discovery, which necessitates continuous adaptation and innovation to maintain competitive advantage. Our international operations are governed by complex laws and regulations, and we must remain compliant to mitigate risks associated with legal and regulatory challenges. We are committed to fostering a purpose-driven culture with a focus on positive impact to all stakeholders, improving our ability to serve customers, and enhancing customer experiences through digitalization. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of external pressures and disruptions. We have implemented cost containment measures to mitigate the unfavorable impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, reflecting our commitment to organizational resilience and effective crisis management.

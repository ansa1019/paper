As of December 31, 2020, the company continues to experience some disruptions, which may extend for the full year and beyond. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the business will depend on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, government regulations, and the overall impact on the global economy. The company has transitioned a significant subset of its employee population to a remote work environment to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, which may exacerbate certain risks, including increased demand for information technology resources and cybersecurity threats. The company has established policies and procedures designed to assist in complying with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing violations that could disrupt operations and cause reputational harm.

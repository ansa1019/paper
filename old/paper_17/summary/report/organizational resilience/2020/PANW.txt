Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the recent global covid-19 outbreak, which could harm our business and results of operations. The impact of covid-19 has caused significant disruptions, leading us to implement measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus and minimize risks to our employees and stakeholders. These measures include transitioning our employee population to work remotely, which may affect our customer success efforts and operational capabilities. The uncertain and rapidly evolving situation has made it difficult to forecast our operating results, as we may experience extended sales cycles and disruptions in our supply chain. Our ability to manage future growth effectively is contingent upon improving our systems, processes, and controls, as well as our operational flexibility and resource allocation. The growth and expansion of our business place significant strain on our management and operational resources, requiring effective coordination throughout the organization. We must continue to adapt and reconfigure our strategies in response to external pressures and market conditions. The ongoing economic downturn may lead to reduced technology spending and adversely affect demand for our offerings. Our ability to attract and retain end-customers is critical, and any failure to do so could result in increased costs and harm our business performance. We are also subject to risks associated with the credit and liquidity of our channel partners and end-customers, particularly in weakened markets. The reliance on our channel partners for sales and distribution exposes us to risks if they fail to perform or if their operations are negatively impacted by external factors. Our corporate culture, which fosters innovation and collaboration, is essential for maintaining organizational resilience as we navigate these challenges. We have experienced growth in our installed end-customer base, and our future success depends on our ability to expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings while ensuring customer satisfaction. The complexity of our operations necessitates a systemic perspective to manage risks effectively and to sustain our organizational health. As we continue to invest in innovation and adapt our strategies, we must also focus on enhancing our operational management and strategic initiatives to maintain a competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment. The evolving nature of our business requires us to remain agile and responsive to changes in customer needs and market dynamics, ensuring that we can confront and recover from unexpected situations. Our commitment to continuous improvement and learning will be vital in fostering resilience and ensuring long-term organizational success.

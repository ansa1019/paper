Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. The company is continually implementing business continuity plans in the face of the pandemic. Due to the critical nature of its products and services, Abbott was generally exempt from governmental orders issued during the first quarter of 2020 in the U.S. and other countries requiring businesses to cease operations. Abbott has taken aggressive steps to limit exposure and enhance the safety of facilities for its employees. The unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic necessitates ongoing adaptation and resilience strategies to ensure operational continuity. Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline. The company must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success due to various challenges, including efficacy or safety concerns and the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Abbott's diagnostics business experienced significant changes in sales due to the pandemic, as it mobilized teams across multiple fronts to develop and launch new diagnostic tests for COVID-19. The companyâ€™s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. Abbott's operational flexibility has been tested by the pandemic, impacting the number of cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedures performed globally. The recovery in procedures and routine testing volumes depends on the progression of COVID-19 cases in various regions. Abbott's diversified healthcare businesses have faced both challenges and opportunities during the pandemic, with some segments performing at required levels to meet new demands. The company has also experienced pressures related to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income. Abbott's ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including regulatory changes and competitive pressures, is essential for maintaining organizational health and performance. The company is subject to numerous governmental regulations, which can be costly to comply with and may disrupt its business operations. Abbott's focus on strategic initiatives, including the expansion of its product portfolio and the introduction of new technologies, reflects its commitment to resilience and adaptability in a turbulent market environment. The ongoing evaluation of risks and the implementation of proactive measures are integral to Abbott's strategy for sustaining growth and ensuring operational effectiveness in the face of adversity.

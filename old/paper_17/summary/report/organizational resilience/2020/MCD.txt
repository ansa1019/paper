Organizational resilience is defined as the organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity. Resilience can be characterized as the system’s ability to maintain its integrity and performance while under internal or external variations and disturbances, whether nominal, extreme, or exceptional. The concept emphasizes the importance of maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions, reflecting businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish. The company has developed a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. The organization’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, which includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company. The management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting indicates that the company believes its internal control is effective. The company is subject to various external pressures, including tax assessments from federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, which may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The company regularly evaluates its business relationships with franchisees and joint venture partners to identify potential variable interest entities, ensuring that it can adapt to changing conditions. The company’s operational flexibility is further supported by its ability to manage its lease portfolio, which includes both operating and finance leases, and to reconfigure lease terms based on market conditions. The organization’s strategic initiatives include investments in technology platforms and marketing contributions aimed at accelerating recovery and driving growth in response to market volatility. The company’s approach to risk management includes the use of foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The company has also established a framework for assessing the effectiveness of its internal controls, which is critical for maintaining organizational health and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The company’s ability to adapt to environmental disruptions is further enhanced by its focus on strategic resilience, which encompasses the deployment of resources and the implementation of mechanisms for recovery during exceptional conditions. Overall, the organization’s resilience strategies are multifaceted, reflecting its commitment to maintaining operational continuity and achieving long-term objectives in a complex and dynamic business environment.

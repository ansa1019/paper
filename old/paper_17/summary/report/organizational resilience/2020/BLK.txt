As a global investment management firm, BlackRock recognizes that risk is an inherent part of its business, with global markets being prone to uncertainty and subject to various risks. The company devotes significant resources to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, reputational, fiduciary, and investment risks. BlackRock's business, financial condition, operating results, and non-operating results could be materially adversely affected by these risks and uncertainties, including changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, and foreign exchange markets. The investment management industry is highly competitive, and BlackRock competes based on investment performance, technology, portfolio construction offerings, and the ability to develop new investment strategies to meet changing investor needs. The company is also impacted by prolonged periods of historically low interest rates and the volatility introduced by changes in interest or foreign exchange rates. BlackRock's ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant harm to the global economy, adversely affecting BlackRock's business, operations, and financial condition, which may lead to reduced assets under management (AUM) and lower revenue. The pandemic has resulted in governmental measures that restrict global economic activity, disrupt supply chains, and cause significant volatility in financial markets. BlackRock's infrastructure, including technological capacity and business continuity plans, is vital to its competitiveness. A failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock's business could materially impact operations and impede growth. The company has implemented business continuity plans to mitigate risks associated with operational disruptions. However, if these plans are not kept up-to-date or are improperly implemented during a disruption, the company's ability to operate could be adversely impacted. BlackRock's operational systems are also susceptible to cyber-attacks, which could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses. The company must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust technological framework, to maximize the benefits of its Aladdin platform, which supports investment advisory services. BlackRock's ability to innovate effectively and manage operational risks is essential for developing new products and services that address client preferences. The company continuously monitors its liquidity and capital resources, ensuring that it can meet anticipated cash needs while navigating the complexities of regulatory requirements and market conditions. BlackRock's diversified platform enables it to generate stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning the firm to invest for the long term by balancing investments for future growth with prudent discretionary expense management. The company's commitment to sustainability and the integration of sustainability-related factors into risk management and product design reflects its focus on building resilient portfolios.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those created by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in significant and pervasive societal, economic, and market disruption globally. We actively monitor the potential direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on our segments, recognizing that our ability to manage risks is subject to inherent limitations in obtaining timely, reliable analysis in an ever-changing situation. The pandemic has affected our business segments, leading to volatility and uncertainty in volumes, client activity, and financial conditions. We have implemented comprehensive strategies to navigate the operating environment spurred by the pandemic, including a work-from-home protocol for our employee population and a phased reopening of our office locations while complying with applicable health guidelines. This flexible and scalable strategy acknowledges the pandemic's widespread nature and its varying impacts on different communities. 

We believe our risk management strategy is designed to provide proactive protection during stress events, and we have maintained substantial liquidity, which is critical for operational continuity. The liquidity available to the parent company is supported by cash, cash equivalents, and unencumbered liquid securities, alongside a line of credit and an unsecured revolving committed credit facility. Our financial strength ratings are crucial for maintaining public confidence in our products and competitive position, and any future downgrade could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

The competitive landscape in which we operate is characterized by intense competition, which could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase market share and profitability. Our businesses operate in a rapidly changing environment, and we face pressures from market fluctuations, regulatory actions, and economic conditions that could adversely affect our strategic objectives. The ability to adapt to these changes is essential for organizational resilience, as we must effectively respond to external pressures and maintain operational flexibility. 

We are committed to developing new products and services that anticipate or respond to changes in the industry and evolving client demands. Our operational management practices include policies and procedures designed to identify, monitor, and manage risks, although these may not be fully effective in all market environments. The introduction of innovative products requires substantial resources and ongoing support, and we continuously assess our exposure to various risks, including employee and financial advisor misconduct. 

In summary, our organizational resilience is reflected in our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity, as we navigate complex situations and maintain a focus on strategic initiatives that support our long-term objectives. The ongoing evaluation of our operational practices and risk management strategies is vital to ensure we can effectively confront unexpected situations and sustain our performance under pressure.

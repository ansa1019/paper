The covid-19 crisis has adversely affected our global business, financial condition, and results of operations, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We are continually assessing the impact and, due to the evolving and disruptive nature of the covid-19 crisis, cannot estimate its ultimate impact on our business. The ongoing economic and societal disruption caused by the crisis has heightened certain risks to our global business. Adverse changes affecting the global economy, including economic downturns and increased volatility in financial markets, have had and may continue to have negative effects on our overall investment portfolio. The short-term economic impacts of covid-19 have been largely offset by intervention taken by governments and monetary authorities, but uncertainty remains regarding the long-term financial impacts on our investment portfolio. The crisis has resulted in increased claim volume under our life and retirement insurance products, particularly in the U.S., where we have experienced an increase in mortality claims. We have made changes to underwriting guidelines or product design in response to the crisis, and we may incur higher expenses in our insurance businesses due to coverage disputes. Our business operations may be significantly disrupted if our critical workforce, key vendors, or third-party providers are unable to work effectively. The extended remote work environment has put stress on our business continuity plans, which may prove less effective than expected. We have implemented work-from-home business continuity plans for non-essential staff globally, and the effectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective, leaving us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk. The separation of our life and retirement business could exacerbate the effects of other risks to which we are exposed, and failure to effectively execute on strategic initiatives could result in costs greater than expected and disruption to our businesses. Our restructuring initiatives may not yield expected reductions in expenses and improvements in operational efficiency. The ongoing assessment of our exposure to loss through reinsurance is critical, and we seek to optimize our reinsurance program to manage volatility and protect the balance sheet from tail events. The impact of low interest rates on our general insurance segment is primarily on our long-tail casualty line of business. Sustained low interest rates may result in higher pension expense due to the impact on discounting projected benefit cash flows. We actively manage our exposure to the interest rate environment through portfolio selection and asset-liability management. The regulatory approach to the crisis and its impact on the insurance industry is still developing, and its ultimate impact remains uncertain. We are committed to maintaining pricing discipline and risk selection to improve profitability. Our businesses are exposed to various catastrophic events that could adversely affect our operating results, and we have implemented a comprehensive risk management framework to monitor and manage these risks. The effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in unexpected losses. We are subject to various operational risks, including those arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems. Our enterprise risk management department supervises and integrates risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of major risk positions.

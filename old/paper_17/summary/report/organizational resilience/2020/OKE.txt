The COVID-19 pandemic has affected adversely, and could further affect adversely, our results of operations, leading to operational challenges and impacting our ability to access capital markets. Uncertainty remains regarding the duration of global impacts due to COVID-19, which could further affect our results of operations by reducing demand for the services we provide and impacting our supply chains. Our ability to maintain or expand our businesses depends largely on the level of drilling and production by third parties in the regions in which we operate. The degree to which the pandemic further impacts our business will depend on future developments beyond our control, including the success of actions to contain the virus and the pace of economic recovery. We expect to maintain sufficient liquidity and financial stability due to cash on hand from our equity issuance, cash flows from operations, and access to our undrawn credit agreement. We continue to look for ways to reduce our environmental impact and utilize more efficient technologies, preparing for the future energy transition. Our growth projects provide us the capacity to benefit from future supply growth without significant capital investment, and we have completed significant capital-growth projects that include natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure. However, we suspended certain announced plans due to the decline in commodity prices and economic demand disruption caused by COVID-19, with the ability to restart these projects quickly when producer activity warrants additional infrastructure. Our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions, which could affect adversely our business. The mechanical integrity of facilities and pipelines operated is critical, and we face risks associated with adequate supply to our gathering, processing, fractionation, and pipeline facilities. The impact of unforeseen changes in interest rates, debt and equity markets, and economic recession could affect our operational continuity and financial performance. We assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually and recorded significant noncash impairment charges due to historic events impacting supply, demand, and commodity prices. Our business is subject to regulatory oversight, and compliance with environmental regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. We utilize derivatives to reduce our market-risk exposure to commodity price and interest-rate fluctuations, aiming to achieve more predictable cash flows. The timely receipt of approval by applicable governmental entities for construction and operation of our pipeline and other projects is necessary for maintaining operational flexibility. We rely on others to provide administrative, operating, and management services for certain of our joint-venture assets, which could affect adversely our business. The ability to control operating costs and make cost-saving changes is essential for resilience in a challenging market environment. Our financial results could be affected adversely if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, which are necessary for reliable financial reporting and operational success. The risk of incurring substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in our business, and we face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. The impact of climate change and changes in investor sentiment towards climate change may affect the demand for our securities and our ability to access capital markets.

Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be impacted by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, which could affect our ability to maintain operational continuity under challenging circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased global economic and demand uncertainty, disrupting supply chains and operations, and has necessitated adaptations in our business practices to ensure resilience. We are continuing to face operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, workplace disruptions, and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. The pandemic has resulted in decreased demand for our products and services, particularly in the aerospace sector, leading to operational flexibility challenges and necessitating strategic responses to mitigate risks. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical, as evidenced by the need to adjust production schedules and mitigate costs in response to reduced customer demand. We have implemented various cost reduction measures, including workforce reductions and restructuring actions, to align our operations with current market conditions. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and its impact on the economy requires us to continuously assess our organizational capabilities and adapt our strategies accordingly. We are also subject to risks associated with our U.S. government contracts, which may be affected by changes in government priorities and budget decisions, potentially impacting our operational effectiveness and financial performance. The integration of legacy businesses following the Raytheon merger presents additional challenges as we seek to realize anticipated benefits without disrupting existing operations. Our defense operations are particularly sensitive to changes in U.S. Department of Defense budget levels and geopolitical events, which can influence our competitive advantage and strategic initiatives. The complexity of our operations necessitates a systemic perspective to manage risks effectively and ensure resilience in the face of external pressures. Our commitment to maintaining organizational health is reflected in our focus on employee engagement and retention, particularly in light of the competitive landscape for skilled personnel. We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and knowledge management in fostering innovation and adaptability. The evolving nature of market conditions and external disturbances requires us to remain vigilant and proactive in our approach to risk management and strategic foresight, ensuring that we can respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain our operational integrity. Our long-term success depends on our ability to navigate these complexities and leverage our organizational strengths to thrive in a turbulent business environment.

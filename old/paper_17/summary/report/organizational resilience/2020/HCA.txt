The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting our operations, business, and financial condition, which could materially impact our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to unexpected situations. Our management is focused on mitigating the impact of the pandemic, requiring substantial investment of time and resources across our enterprise, which may affect our ability to prioritize and execute on other strategic initiatives. We have been working with federal, state, and local health authorities to respond to COVID-19 cases in the markets we serve and continue to take measures to limit the spread of the virus and mitigate the burden on the healthcare system. We are subject to COVID-19 data reporting requirements, and some states mandate hospitals to maintain a reserve of personal protective equipment (PPE) and conduct COVID-19 screening for new patients and staff. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to protecting the health and well-being of our patients and employees, including pandemic pay programs and additional operational changes in response to this pandemic. Staffing, equipment, and supply shortages may impact our ability to schedule, admit, and treat patients, and the pandemic has resulted in increased early retirements in our workforce and fewer graduate nurses entering the workforce. The combined impact of these factors could lead to reduced employee morale and increased exposure to labor unrest. Restrictions on elective procedures and other measures have reduced the volume of procedures performed at our facilities, significantly affecting our operating revenues. We may continue to cancel elective procedures and close or reduce operating hours at our facilities in response to fluctuating COVID-19 cases. The pandemic has also led to a decline in patient volumes and increased uncertainty regarding future demand for our services. We believe that certain declines in patient volume reflect a deferral of healthcare services rather than a permanent reduction in demand. Additionally, the expanded use of telehealth services from other providers may adversely affect our patient volumes. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We have disaster plans in place and operate under infectious disease protocols, but the potential emergence of a pandemic or public health crisis is difficult to predict. Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, exposing us to risks that could impact our operational flexibility and overall organizational resilience. The competitive landscape is intensifying, with increasing consolidation among healthcare providers and third-party payers, which may limit our ability to negotiate favorable contracts and maintain our market position. Our operations are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, making us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, and public health conditions in those states. The ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and other external pressures necessitate a focus on strategic resilience, resource allocation, and adaptability to ensure our long-term success and organizational health.

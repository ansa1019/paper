The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect will continue to have, certain impacts on our business and operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities, and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. We have experienced decreases in sales in many of our markets, and the resurgence of the pandemic has slowed or reversed the reopening process in some jurisdictions. Deteriorating economic conditions and continued financial uncertainties could affect consumer purchasing power and reduce demand for our products. The closures of, and continued restrictions on, on-premise retailers and other establishments that sell our products have adversely impacted our sales. Our advertising, marketing, promotional, sponsorship, and endorsement activities have been disrupted by reduced opportunities due to the pandemic, which may negatively affect our sales, market share, volume growth, and overall financial results. Our innovation activities, including the introduction of new products, have been delayed and adversely impacted by the pandemic. Some of our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, and co-packers may experience plant closures, production slowdowns, and disruptions in operations as a result of the pandemic, which could disrupt our operations. We may experience delays in receiving certain raw materials due to shipping delays and reduced availability of commercial transportation. Our reliance on relationships with third parties for cloud data storage and other information technology services exposes us to risks related to the pandemic, which may interfere with their ability to fulfill their commitments. We have implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies to prioritize the health and safety of our employees. We are continually addressing the increase in our aluminum can requirements given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. Overall, we are not experiencing significant raw material or finished product shortages, and our supply chain remains intact. However, depending on the duration of any COVID-19 pandemic-related issues, we may experience material disruptions in our supply chain. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including economic and political instability in our international markets, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions. We believe that our ability to adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the shift towards e-commerce, will be critical for maintaining our competitive advantage. The impact of climate change and natural disasters may also affect our business, as changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity and increased costs for key ingredients. Our organizational resilience will depend on our ability to manage these challenges effectively while continuing to innovate and meet evolving consumer preferences.

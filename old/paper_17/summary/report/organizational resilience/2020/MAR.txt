We are subject to various risks that make an investment in our securities risky, and the events and consequences discussed could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. COVID-19 has had a material detrimental impact on our business and financial results, and such impact could continue and may worsen for an unknown period of time. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of COVID-19 and its impact on global and regional economies. The significant decline in demand for hotel rooms has led us to take steps to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency, including furloughing a substantial number of associates and implementing reduced work weeks. Such steps may negatively impact guest loyalty, owner preference, or our ability to attract and retain associates, which could limit our ability to maintain or expand our business and reduce our profits. The operational flexibility we have implemented in response to COVID-19 includes business contingency plans that have been adjusted in response to the global situation, and we have taken substantial measures to mitigate the negative financial and operational impacts for our hotel owners and our own business. We have worked with owners and franchisees to lower their cash outlays, including deferring renovations and certain hotel initiatives, and waiving required funding through 2021. Our ability to recover loans and guarantee advances from hotel operations may also affect our ability to recycle and raise new capital. The impact of COVID-19 on our business remains fluid, and we expect to continue to assess and may implement additional measures to adapt our operations and plans as we evaluate the implications of COVID-19 on our business. The challenges posed by COVID-19 have highlighted the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms in maintaining operational continuity and adapting to unexpected situations. We have recognized the need for resource allocation and strategic initiatives to navigate the adverse conditions imposed by the pandemic. Our organizational capabilities have been tested, and the ability to absorb strain while preserving functioning is critical for our survival and growth. The risks related to our industry, including economic downturns and other global conditions, could further impact our financial results and growth. The competitive landscape has changed, and our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and efficiency of our lodging products and services. We have seen a decline in travel and reduced demand for lodging due to various disruptive events, including natural disasters and the spread of contagious diseases. The operational and financial impact of these events is highly dependent on the breadth and duration of their effects, including the availability and distribution of effective vaccines or treatments. We continue to monitor the status of the capital markets and evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. Our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these challenges is essential for maintaining our organizational resilience and ensuring our long-term success.

Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the outbreak and spread of the novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19, which has significantly impacted our operations, financial performance, and liquidity. The pandemic has resulted in substantial curtailment of business activities, weakened economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, and significant economic uncertainty. The ongoing severity, magnitude, and duration of the pandemic and its economic consequences remain uncertain, impacting our ability to effectively respond to evolving factors. We conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories, facing cyclicality affecting national and international economies, which may hinder our ability to adjust our business model to mitigate impacts. Changes in general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, may adversely affect us, as we are significantly impacted by levels of industrial production, consumer spending, and retail activity. The competitive landscape is rapidly evolving, with significant competition from various transportation and e-commerce companies, necessitating timely and appropriate responses to competitive pressures. Our strategic initiatives, including transformation, aim to enhance capabilities valued by customers, focusing on speed and ease of access to services. The pandemic has accelerated a market shift towards e-commerce, increasing demand for residential deliveries while also driving higher operating costs. We have invested in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management, and disaster recovery plans to mitigate risks associated with data breaches and system disruptions. Severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters could materially adversely affect us, disrupting business and resulting in decreased revenues. Our ability to attract, engage, develop, and retain a large and diverse global workforce is critical, as failure to do so could lead to increased employment costs, reduced sales, and diminished brand value. We are also exposed to various claims and litigation that could result in significant expenditures. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our inability to effectively integrate acquired operations or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic alliances. We regularly evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure, including through debt issuances to refinance existing debt and fund operations. We have significant capital and other investments in our business, which are tied to projected volume levels and economic conditions. The impact of changes in fuel and energy prices, exchange rates, and interest rates may also have a material adverse effect on us. Our participation in multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans is subject to collective bargaining agreements, and future contributions may be determined through negotiations. We are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations that could materially increase our operating costs. The evolving regulatory landscape, particularly regarding climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, may impose substantial costs and affect our competitive position. Our ability to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation is essential, as service quality issues could adversely affect customer demand. Our strategic response to these challenges includes enhancing operational flexibility, adapting to external pressures, and maintaining organizational resilience through effective risk management and resource allocation.

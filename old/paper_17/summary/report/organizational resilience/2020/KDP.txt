The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created widespread health developments and economic uncertainty that could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations.

These measures include adjusting current policies as regulations evolve and ensuring the health and safety of employees, which is crucial for maintaining operational continuity. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of adaptability and resilience in responding to changing consumer behaviors and market conditions.

The global economic climate and additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic amplify many risks, which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. Public health crises or epidemic diseases have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our operations, supply chains, and distribution systems, leading to significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products as healthcare customers divert medical resources. We experienced significant business disruptions, including restrictions on travel and access to customers, temporary closures of facilities, and reduced access due to diverted resources. Our reliance on sole and single-source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within budget. Disruptions at government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain, or deploy key personnel, which may adversely affect our business. The ability of hospitals and other surgery facilities to meet regulatory standards may impact their utilization of our products. We are subject to significant, uninsured liabilities, and negative publicity concerning our products could reduce market acceptance and result in decreased product demand. Our success depends on the quality and reliability of our products, and defects could incur unforeseen costs, harm our reputation, and lead to product recalls. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, and the loss of key personnel could harm our ability to compete. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased credit risks and may result in collection delinquencies and defaults, which could materially impact our financial condition. Our business model includes alternative capital acquisition approaches, exposing us to credit risk from customers. The economic recession caused by the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our long-term business as hospitals curtail spending. We are focused on the health and safety of all those we serve and are ensuring continuity of supply by working with suppliers and distributors. We continue to invest in priority development programs while eliminating avoidable spending. Our response to the pandemic includes providing financial relief to customers through service fee credits and deferring lease payments. The uncertainty of the recovery from COVID-19 presents risks to our performance, financial condition, and cash flows. We expect that the depth and extent of the pandemic's impact will vary based on the availability of testing capabilities, personal protective equipment, and medical staff. Our priorities include supporting our customers according to their clinical, operational, and economic needs. We have built a valuable team and believe they will be important in the recovery that follows the pandemic. The success of new product introductions depends on timely and successful research and development, regulatory clearances, and market acceptance. We are committed to expanding our operations and adapting to the evolving healthcare environment while managing the risks associated with our business practices.

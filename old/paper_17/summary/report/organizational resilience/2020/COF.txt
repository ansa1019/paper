This section highlights significant factors, events, and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business and financial results, with the extent of its impact depending on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known or considered significant risks. We face risks related to our operational, technological, and organizational infrastructure, including the theft, loss, or misuse of information due to cyber-attacks, which may result in increased costs, reductions in revenue, reputational damage, and business disruptions. Our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk. We recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality and strive to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns through sound underwriting practices. The chief risk officer is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and monitoring credit exposure and performance. We continuously monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk, with trends in delinquency rates serving as a key credit quality indicator. Our ability to manage credit risk is affected by legal or regulatory changes, competitors' actions, and consumer behavior. We also face risks from unpredictable catastrophic events, and despite the business contingency plans in place, such plans do not fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks. Our liquidity management philosophy is designed to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover our funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand potential impacts from deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in funding markets. We have established practices to manage liquidity risk, including maintaining access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources and a sizable liquidity reserve comprised of cash and cash equivalents. The COVID-19 pandemic has led us to modify our business practices, including offering a range of forbearance options to customers, which could impact our credit metrics and financial condition. We have implemented work-from-home policies for a majority of our employees and continue to monitor local conditions to ensure the safety of our associates and customers while providing critical banking services. Our risk management framework sets consistent expectations for risk management across the company, with accountability for overseeing an effective framework residing with our board of directors. The framework includes governance and accountability, strategy and risk alignment, risk identification, assessment, measurement and response, monitoring and testing, aggregation, reporting and escalation, capital and liquidity management, risk data and enabling technology, and culture and talent management. We recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions, and we manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues to strengthen our reputation. The heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture, values, and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change.

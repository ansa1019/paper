The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including those arising from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions in the worldwide economy and reduced demand for oil and natural gas. This situation has adversely affected our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have experienced significant volatility in commodity prices, leading to a reduction in our capital expenditure budgets and production guidance, and we have curtailed near-term production in response to these challenges. The integration of QEP into our business may not be as successful as anticipated, and we may not achieve the intended benefits or do so within the intended timeframe. Potential difficulties in the integration process include the inability to successfully integrate QEP in a manner that allows us to achieve the full revenue and cost savings anticipated, complexities associated with managing a larger, more complex business, and the loss of key employees. We are also subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business and impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel. The pending merger involves numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax, and other risks, and uncertainties related to the design, operation, and integration of QEP's internal control over financial reporting. Our ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to many factors independent of the pending merger, some of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings, or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis and a swift and unprecedented reduction in economic activity, which has adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas and caused significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets. Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water, and restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future. The uncertainty and risks described may impede our ability to economically find, develop, and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. Our success depends on finding, developing, or acquiring additional reserves, and our future success depends upon our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. We may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration, development, production, or other replacement activities. Our drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, and environmental hazards. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses. We have maintained insurance against some, but not all, of our business risks, and the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the pandemic will have on our results due to numerous factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, public health measures, general economic disruption, and the impact on macroeconomic conditions. Our revenues and those of our operators are dependent on occupancy, which has declined significantly due to the pandemic, affecting net operating income and the ability of operators to make payments. Increased operational costs have resulted from public health measures, which may continue to elevate expenses beyond the pandemic. The financial impact on our operators and tenants may necessitate concessions such as rent deferrals or abatements, and there is a heightened risk of tenant, operator, or borrower bankruptcy due to decreased occupancy and increased operational pressures. Our ability to transition leased properties to new tenants may be limited under current conditions, exposing us to potential liabilities. The pandemic has introduced operational challenges, including increased costs related to health and safety measures, and may impact employee morale and productivity. We have undertaken extensive efforts to ensure the safety of our properties and employees, but the pandemic's effects could lead to additional operational costs and reputational risks. Our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be limited due to uncertainty regarding the pandemic's length and severity. Disruptions to acquisition, disposition, and development activities may negatively impact our long-term competitive position. The ability to maintain our REIT status is contingent upon meeting specific requirements, and any failure to do so could have serious tax consequences. The impacts of the pandemic on our results could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, and we may face liquidity constraints if access to capital is restricted. Our operations are also exposed to risks from severe weather conditions, natural disasters, and the physical effects of climate change, which could result in increased costs and decreased revenues. We are subject to various operational risks, including compliance with health care regulations and the financial condition of our operators and tenants. The inability to manage these risks effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We rely on key personnel for our operations, and competition for qualified talent is intense, which could impact our ability to execute our business strategy. Our capital structure involves exposure to risks, including leverage and the availability of cash for distributions to stockholders. Changes in interest rates and credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of capital and liquidity. The uncertainty of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services may also impact our operations. Our ability to adapt to these challenges and maintain operational flexibility is crucial for sustaining performance under pressure and achieving organizational resilience in the face of external disturbances.

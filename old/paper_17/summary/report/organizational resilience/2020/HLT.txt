The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The pandemic has strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions and stay-at-home directives, resulting in cancellations and reduced travel, as well as complete and partial suspensions of certain hotel operations. The current and uncertain future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to negatively affect our results, operations, outlook, plans, growth, cash flows, and liquidity. We have implemented new hygiene and cleaning standards to support our recovery and maintain operational continuity. The steps taken to reduce operating costs, including workforce reductions and furloughs, may negatively affect our brand reputation and ability to attract and retain employees. Even after the pandemic subsides, we could experience long-term impacts on our operating costs due to enhanced health and hygiene requirements. The significant increase in unemployment and adverse changes in the perceived economic climate will also negatively affect travel demand. The steps we have taken to mitigate risks during this period include securing liquidity through various measures, such as drawing down on our revolving credit facility and suspending dividend payments. We have also launched initiatives to support our communities and provide financial assistance to organizations responding to pandemic-related needs. Our strategic objectives include continued expansion of our global footprint and fee-based business, although the current economic environment poses challenges to executing our strategy, including delays in openings and new development. The hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility, which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition. The ability to maintain relationships with third-party property owners and franchisees is critical for our business continuity and growth. We depend on our long-term management and franchise contracts with third-party hotel owners and hotel franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchise fee revenues. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant declines in revenue, particularly in management and franchise fees, due to reduced occupancy and average daily rates across our properties. The uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic complicates our ability to predict future demand and pricing. We are subject to various risks inherent to the hospitality industry, including competition, economic conditions, and governmental regulations. Our ability to adapt to these challenges and maintain operational flexibility is essential for organizational resilience. We recognize that the ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is crucial for survival and growth. The potential impacts of the pandemic on our partners, including third-party owners and service providers, further complicate our operational landscape. Our focus on maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions will guide our strategic initiatives and resilience strategies moving forward.

The company relies heavily on certain customers for much of its sales, with a material reduction in purchasing by larger customers potentially having a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. The company does not generally have guaranteed future sales and must anticipate future volumes based on historic purchasing patterns and discussions with customers, which may not materialize. The company intends to pursue acquisitions, which may be adversely affected if it cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or effectively integrate acquired operations. The successful integration of new businesses depends on the ability to manage these businesses and cut excess costs, which could decrease the time available to service customers and develop new products. The company has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could increase vulnerability to economic downturns and limit flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the business environment. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted operations, with potential supply chain disruptions, employee absenteeism, and short-term suspensions of manufacturing facilities anticipated. The company has taken immediate actions to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces and reduce costs, including workforce reductions to align operations with customer demand. The company has also explored new business opportunities arising from the pandemic, focusing on developing highly engineered solutions. The company’s operations are dependent on manufacturing facilities that are subject to various risks, including natural disasters and health-related crises. Disruptions could occur due to cyber-attacks, operator error, or process failures, and should insurance or risk transfer mechanisms be insufficient, the company could experience a material adverse effect on its business. The company’s sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical, and downturns in sales may adversely affect financial performance. The company is also subject to various risks inherent in international operations, including global health crises and currency fluctuations, which could materially affect results. The company’s ability to generate cash flow from operations is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors beyond its control. The company has taken steps to manage its cost structure and maintain cash flow, including implementing cost mitigation measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company believes its competitive strengths, including a diversified revenue base and a focus on obtaining profitable new business, will help maintain financial performance. The company’s strategy includes a selective acquisition approach, which has historically contributed to growth and improved financial performance. The company continues to analyze its cost structure and may implement additional cost reduction measures as necessary due to ongoing business challenges. The company’s future leverage will be impacted by the conditions of credit markets, and it expects to meet its short-term cash liquidity requirements through net cash from operating activities and available borrowing capacity.

In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, we face various risks related to pandemics, epidemics, or similar widespread public health concerns, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of maintaining operational continuity and the health, safety, and well-being of our employees, including key employees. We have implemented additional health and safety measures and social distancing protocols to ensure their safety. Our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and key office facilities is critical, as we are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing products on a global scale. We have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and contract manufacturers, which are essential for mitigating risks associated with supply chain disruptions. 

The impact of COVID-19 has resulted in significant changes in consumer demand and purchasing patterns, necessitating our ability to adapt quickly to these evolving conditions. We have experienced increased demand for certain products, requiring us to ramp up production capacity, which involves considerable costs and operational flexibility. Our strategy includes leveraging digital technology and data analytics to gain insights and develop relevant marketing to reach consumers effectively. 

We also face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and geopolitical events, which can disrupt trade and impact our ability to sell products competitively. The geographic diversity of our operations helps mitigate risks in any one country, but it also exposes us to various external pressures. 

Our commitment to innovation and the successful identification, development, and launch of new products is integral to our resilience strategy. We prioritize investments in high-growth segments and adapt our offerings to meet changing consumer preferences. The ability to foresee and respond effectively to environmental disruptions, including changes in consumer behavior and market dynamics, is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. 

Furthermore, we recognize the importance of strategic initiatives that enhance our organizational capabilities and foster inter-organizational collaboration. Our focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives is part of our broader strategy to build organizational strength and resilience. 

We continuously monitor key indicators of business health and performance, including net sales, organic sales growth, and market share data, to assess our position in the competitive landscape. Our operational management practices are designed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that we can navigate complex situations and maintain performance under pressure. 

In summary, our ability to adapt to unexpected situations, manage risks, and leverage our resources effectively is crucial for sustaining our organizational resilience and achieving long-term success in a rapidly changing business environment.

Our operations and business have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could significantly disrupt operations and may materially and adversely affect our business and financial conditions. The pandemic has created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and while efforts to mitigate its spread are ongoing, the efficacy and timing of such measures remain uncertain. The company carefully considers government restrictions and the needs of its employees and host communities, leading to the temporary placement of certain operations into care and maintenance. Although all such sites safely recommenced activities, further restrictions could result in an adverse impact on operations and productivity. The company incurred costs as a result of actions taken to protect against the impacts of the pandemic, including contributions to community support funds and additional health screenings. Senior management may decide to reduce operational activities based on evolving contagion rates, which could adversely impact business, financial condition, and results of operations. The full extent of the pandemic's impact will depend on future developments, including the rollout and effectiveness of vaccines. 

We operate in multiple jurisdictions, facing risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could significantly disrupt operations. The company has developed a robust system of environmental, social, and governance management that includes standards, guidance, and assurance to optimize economic development and employment opportunities associated with operations. Increased stakeholder expectations for transparency on environmental, social, and governance performance may result in operational disruptions, increased costs, and investment obligations. 

The company is dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems, which are subject to disruption from cyber threats, natural disasters, and other risks. The evolving nature of these threats makes it increasingly difficult to identify and quantify cybersecurity risks, which could have an adverse impact on business operations and reputation. 

We have established a disciplined cash allocation strategy to maintain financial flexibility and generate long-term value for shareholders. The company aims to self-fund development projects and make strategic partnerships focused on profitable growth while reducing debt and returning cash to stockholders. Our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to fund operations and corporate activities, and we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and cash generated from operations will satisfy working capital needs, fund future growth, and meet debt obligations. 

The company has developed a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. This model emphasizes the importance of adaptability and operational flexibility in maintaining organizational health and performance under challenging conditions. The ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes is critical for survival and growth. 

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have placed five mine sites temporarily into care and maintenance, with operations resuming as conditions permit. The company has adopted a risk-based approach to business travel and implemented health protocols to protect the workforce and local communities. The ongoing evaluation of operational practices and stakeholder engagement is essential for maintaining organizational resilience and ensuring business continuity in the face of external pressures and uncertainties.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations, creating significant disruptions and exacerbating existing risks. We have been negatively impacted by the pandemic, including the suspension of our global brands' operations and the resulting decline in revenues and cash inflows, which has required us to take cost and capital expenditure containment actions. Consequently, we have reduced and furloughed our workforce, which may challenge our ability to rebuild our workforce and further delay our return to service. The suspension of sailings and the expected reduction in demand for future cruising have led to a significant decline in our revenues, necessitating actions to monitor and mitigate changes in our supply chain and port destination availability, which may strain relationships with our vendors and port partners. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic has made it difficult to predict the impact of further disruptions and their magnitude, which may depend on how they coincide with our plans to resume sailing. We have taken significant actions to enhance our liquidity, preserve cash, and obtain additional financing, including reducing ship operating expenses and eliminating or significantly reducing marketing and selling expenses. We have also identified substantial capital expenditure reductions or deferrals in 2020 and 2021, which are critical to our operational flexibility and recovery strategies. Our ability to meet the requirements under the CDC's conditional order will determine the timing and implementation of our plans to return to service, which we expect to be gradual. The conditional order requires that we successfully employ measures that mitigate the risk of COVID-19, which poses additional challenges to our operational continuity. We have formed an expert panel to develop a comprehensive set of enhanced health and safety protocols, which are essential for our recovery and the maintenance of organizational health. The impact of COVID-19 has also resulted in significant impairment charges related to our goodwill and long-lived assets, reflecting the adverse effects on our financial condition. We continue to evaluate our liquidity needs and have taken actions to improve our liquidity position, including amending credit agreements to defer payments and covenant requirements. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our obligations. The complexities of the pandemic's impact on our operations have necessitated a reevaluation of our international business strategies and the implementation of proactive measures to ensure our organizational resilience. We are focused on our healthy return-to-service program, collaborating with health authorities and governments to ensure a safe return to cruising for guests, crew, and the communities we visit. The ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic require us to remain adaptable and responsive to changing conditions, which are critical for our survival and future success in the competitive landscape of the cruise industry.

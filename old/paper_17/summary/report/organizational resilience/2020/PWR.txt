Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have materially affected our and our customers' businesses, creating significant volatility and disruption. We have experienced disruptions to our business operations, particularly in major metropolitan markets, and have encountered permitting and regulatory delays attributable to the pandemic. The nature of our business exposes us to operational hazards that can result in significant liabilities, and we may not be insured against all potential liabilities. Our decentralized management infrastructure could negatively impact our business, as it contributes to the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting key business matters. The loss of key personnel could disrupt our business, and our ability to efficiently manage our workforce is limited by our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. A significant portion of our revenues is dependent on a few customers, and the loss of business from certain significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in estimates related to revenues and costs associated with our contracts with customers could result in a reduction or elimination of revenues, and we may fail to adequately recover on contract change orders or claims against customers. We are also subject to lawsuits, claims, and other legal proceedings that can lead to significant costs and reputational harm. Our business is labor-intensive, and we may incur significant costs if we are unable to efficiently manage our workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded broader challenges in the energy market, affecting our operations and financial performance. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet to navigate these challenges, and we have implemented proactive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees. Our ability to generate internal growth is affected by various factors, including our ability to attract new customers and expand our service offerings. We believe there are long-term growth opportunities across our industries, and we continue to evaluate potential acquisition and investment opportunities. The regulatory environment creates both challenges and opportunities for our business, and we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could result in significant liabilities. Our financial strategy and consistent performance have earned us an investment-grade credit rating, but our ability to access capital markets depends on various factors, including our financial performance and market conditions. We expect substantial capital expenditures and commitments under equipment lease and rental arrangements to meet anticipated demand for our services. Our results of operations can be influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in demand for our services, economic conditions, and project variability. We also face competitive pressures that could negatively impact our business, and technological advancements may alter our customers' existing operating models or the services they require. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations remains uncertain, and we expect continued operational challenges as we navigate this unprecedented environment.

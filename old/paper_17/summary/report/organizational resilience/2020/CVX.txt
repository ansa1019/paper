Chevron's operations and workforce are being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, causing certain operations to be curtailed to various degrees, which may affect business continuity. The ultimate effects of COVID-19 on construction projects remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. In-country conditions, including potential future waves of the COVID-19 virus, could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity. The significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the pandemic's impact makes it difficult to develop reliable estimates and assumptions that may materially affect the company's financial and operational performance. The evolving impact of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate other risk factors, further materially and adversely affecting business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and profitability. The company evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process, recognizing that extended periods of low prices can adversely impact results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Chevron's operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from severe weather, civil unrest, and epidemic diseases, which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the environment. The company's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. Failure to manage operational risks effectively could impair the ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents. Chevron has implemented a system of corporate policies and processes to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability, and efficiency risks, and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure, relying on existing liquidity and financial resources to meet short-term obligations arising from unforeseen events. The company is subject to liability risks from litigation or government action due to the hazardous nature of its operations, which could result in significant delays or liabilities. Political instability and changes in the regulatory environment could harm Chevron's business, particularly in exploration and production. The company is required to comply with U.S. sanctions and other trade laws, and changes in environmental regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could increase operational costs and reduce demand for its products. Increasing attention to climate change and societal expectations may result in increased costs, reduced demand, and negative impacts on stock price and access to capital markets. The ultimate impact of climate change-related agreements and regulations on financial performance is uncertain, as it depends on various factors, including the sectors covered and the extent of emission reductions required. The company integrates climate change considerations into its strategy, planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management processes. Changes in management's estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on financial statements and operational performance, as these estimates are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty.

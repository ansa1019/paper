The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts are having a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and cash flows. The pandemic's impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives successfully, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Our operations have faced increased challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, including site shutdowns and workplace disruptions. We expect that the longer the period of economic and global supply chain disruption continues, the more material the cumulative adverse impact will be on our business operations and financial performance. Our ability to manufacture our products is highly dependent on maintaining the safety and health of our employees, which may be significantly impacted by COVID-19. In response to the pandemic, we implemented cost reduction initiatives, including temporary work hour reductions and salary reductions for many employees, to preserve jobs and ensure we can quickly respond to increased customer demand when procedures resume. The prioritization of vaccine distribution could affect the availability of transportation for our supply chain needs. We have established business continuity plans and a global crisis management team focused on protecting our employees and customers, optimizing our operations, and securing our supply chain. We have successfully implemented measures to facilitate social distancing, limit sales visits, and accelerate capabilities to provide remote physician support. The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations and financial performance to risks, including reduced demand for certain products, customer requests for payment deferrals, and delays in deliveries. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic has made estimating future performance extremely challenging, and changes in underlying estimates could materially impact our results. The pandemic may also heighten many of the other risks described in our risk factors. We continue to focus on the health and safety of patients, healthcare providers, and employees while executing our mission of transforming lives through innovative medical solutions. Our long-term fundamentals remain strong, and we believe we will manage through these challenges with strategic focus and the commitment of our global team. We have implemented a careful and tiered approach for employees to return to our sites, adjusting for the recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases. Our gross profit margin has been negatively impacted by manufacturing costs associated with abnormally low production levels due to the pandemic. We have resumed manufacturing and returned to more normalized production levels. The severity, magnitude, and duration of the pandemic's economic consequences remain uncertain, and procedural delays may continue to negatively impact demand for our products and overall financial performance. We have evaluated the recoverability of our assets and will continue to monitor for indicators of impairment. Our strategic initiatives aim to enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency while preserving our ability to invest in research and development projects critical to our long-term success.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The outbreak has led to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets, impacting regional, national, and global economic activity. The measures taken to limit the spread of COVID-19, including restrictions on movement and business operations, have resulted in operational limitations, affecting our clients' ability to meet their obligations. We may experience difficulties in leasing, selling, or redeveloping vacant properties or renewing leases on acceptable terms. The financial impact of the pandemic could negatively affect our credit ratings and our ability to pay dividends, leading to potential defaults and impairments on our properties. The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. We have taken precautionary measures within our organization to reduce the risk of the virus to our employees and clients, including instituting a work-from-home policy and suspending non-essential travel. These actions may further negatively impact our business and financial condition. The pandemic has highlighted the need for effective risk management and adaptability in our operations, as we face pressures from clients seeking rent relief and potential bankruptcies. We have recorded reserves as a reduction of rental revenue and provisions for impairment on certain assets due to the adverse impacts of the pandemic. Our ability to collect rent may be further adversely impacted as the pandemic continues. The ongoing disruption has necessitated a reevaluation of our operational strategies and has underscored the importance of maintaining organizational resilience in the face of unexpected challenges. We continue to monitor the situation closely and assess the potential impacts on our business, including the need for strategic initiatives to enhance our operational flexibility and resource management. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic may lead to further declines in occupancy levels and rental rates, affecting our cash flow from operations and inhibiting growth. We recognize the importance of maintaining strong relationships with our clients and adapting our business strategies to navigate the complexities of the current environment. The challenges posed by the pandemic have reinforced the need for a proactive approach to crisis management and organizational change processes to ensure long-term sustainability and success.

The impact of COVID-19 continues to create considerable uncertainty for our business, exposing us to risks associated with the pandemic that may result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operating costs, or adverse impacts to our supply chain. We have developed and implemented health and safety protocols, business continuity plans, and crisis management protocols to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our employees and our business. Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences is critical, as consumer preferences continuously evolve due to various factors, including changes in demographics and consumption patterns. The retail landscape continues to evolve, including rapid growth in e-commerce channels, and we must maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers to compete effectively. Our business operations are subject to disruption by natural disasters or other events beyond our control, which could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively resolve these issues. We continue to monitor the economic, operating, and political environment in various markets closely and identify actions to mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Our operations are also impacted by political and social conditions, which can result in adverse effects on our business. We are focused on becoming faster, stronger, and better by improving profitability and capturing fair share of category growth, investing in digital initiatives, and driving holistic cost management throughout our organization. We believe these priorities will position our company for long-term sustainable growth. The ongoing economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets, which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. The companyâ€™s risk management framework involves identifying, assessing, prioritizing, addressing, managing, monitoring, and communicating risks across operations, with oversight from the board of directors. The Pepsico Risk Committee meets regularly to address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational, and other risks. We have also incurred increased employee and operating costs due to COVID-19, including costs related to expanded benefits and frontline incentives, which have negatively impacted our profitability. Our ability to attract, develop, and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce is critical, as any unplanned turnover can deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. We are committed to supporting practices and technologies that improve agricultural resiliency and using resources such as water more efficiently. The effects of climate change may also negatively affect our business and operations, as they could impair our production capabilities and disrupt our supply chain. Our strategic response includes investing in capabilities that enhance operational flexibility and resilience, allowing us to adapt to changing business needs and external pressures. We continue to evaluate our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs.

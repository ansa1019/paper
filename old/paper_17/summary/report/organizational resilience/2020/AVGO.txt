Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our ability to maintain operational continuity and resilience under challenging conditions. The ongoing pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy and disrupted normal business activity, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We have experienced disruptions to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain, with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation, which could limit our ability to fulfill orders and satisfy customer demand. In response to governmental directives and recommended safety measures, we modified our workplace practices globally, resulting in many employees working remotely for extended periods. This shift may reduce efficiency and productivity, potentially causing delays in product development and hampering new product innovation. Furthermore, if a significant number of our employees become ill, our business may be further adversely impacted. We have taken various actions to de-risk our business, such as largely building semiconductor products to order instead of based on customer forecasts, which reflects our adaptability to unexpected situations. Our dependence on a small number of customers increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and sensitivity to adverse developments experienced by these significant customers. We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, relying on contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity and produce products of acceptable quality. Any substantial disruption in our supply chain, whether due to natural disasters, political unrest, or other causes, could materially harm our business and customer relationships. We must maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity and product yields at our facilities to meet anticipated customer demand, and failure to do so could result in excess capacity or inability to meet customer needs. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change and price erosion, which necessitates our continuous adaptation and innovation to maintain competitive advantage. Our strategy includes pursuing acquisitions and investments to enhance our market coverage and technological capabilities, which involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations. We recognize that our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform our operations is crucial for emerging stronger from challenging situations. Our organizational resilience is reflected in our efforts to manage operational resources, including maintaining strong relationships with customers and suppliers, and adapting to market conditions. The complexity of our products and the need for timely development and production require us to effectively manage our internal knowledge and capabilities. Our financial health and ability to execute our business strategy may be adversely affected by our substantial indebtedness, which limits our operational flexibility and ability to react to changes in the market. We continue to monitor the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the broader economic environment, recognizing that our resilience strategies must evolve in response to ongoing challenges.

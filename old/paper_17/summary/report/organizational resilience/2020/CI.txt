As a large global health service company operating in a complex industry, we encounter a variety of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition, or the trading price of our securities. Future performance of our business will depend on our ability to execute our strategic and operational initiatives effectively, which includes differentiating our products and services, developing innovative solutions, and managing our medical, pharmacy, administrative, and other operating costs effectively. Our strategic initiatives require effective collaboration across operations, integration of acquired businesses, and a focus on individual customers and clients. If we fail to adapt to competitive, economic, and regulatory changes, our business may be unable to grow as planned. The health service industry continues to be dynamic and rapidly evolving, with significant shifts in industry structure potentially altering dynamics and adversely affecting our ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened potential adverse effects on our business, including unfavorable economic conditions on our clients and customers, changes in medical claims submission patterns, increased costs for COVID-19-related care, and significant disruptions in service among key suppliers. Our ability to effectively invest in, implement improvements to, and maintain the uninterrupted operation of our information technology and other business systems is critical to our organizational resilience. We must continue to enhance our technology systems to anticipate customer needs and protect against cybersecurity risks. Our business continuity plans are essential for mitigating risks associated with prescription drug supply and ensuring operational continuity during disruptions. Our success depends on maintaining effective relationships with third parties for various services, and any failure in these relationships could adversely affect our operations. We are also subject to substantial government regulation, which requires us to identify, assess, and respond to new trends in the legislative and regulatory environment. Our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health service providers is key to transitioning from volume-based fee-for-service arrangements to a value-based health care system. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business are uncertain, and we believe that our results may be affected by higher medical costs, lower customer volumes, and the potential for continued deferral of care. We actively monitor our liquidity and capital resources to ensure we can meet our obligations, and we have taken actions to enhance our liquidity. Our organizational efficiency plan aims to increase alignment and operational efficiency, which is expected to yield significant cost savings. We recognize that our ability to adapt to changes and manage risks effectively is crucial for maintaining organizational resilience and achieving our strategic objectives.

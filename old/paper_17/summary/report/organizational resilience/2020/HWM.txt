Howmet's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has subjected operations and financial performance to various risks. The company continues to monitor the evolving situation to determine whether significant modifications to business practices are necessary. Future shutdowns may be required to match production to reduced customer demand, and challenges may arise in restoring production levels as COVID-19 abates. The pandemic has resulted in disruptions affecting demand, which could continue to have a material adverse effect on business operations. The company has been focusing on liquidity and cash flows, implementing cost reductions, and streamlining organizational structures to enhance operational performance. Additionally, Howmet's management has emphasized capital efficiency to maintain a solid financial position. The company relies on a limited number of suppliers for essential raw materials, and supply chain disruptions could adversely affect operations and profitability. The ongoing pandemic may exacerbate risks related to global economic conditions, competition, and customer relationships. Howmet's operations are also subject to cyclical fluctuations influenced by various external factors, including geopolitical risks and changes in government policies. The company has experienced manufacturing difficulties and other issues impacting product performance, which could adversely affect reputation and financial results. The occurrence of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, or public health crises could disrupt operations and hinder the ability to meet customer demand. Howmet maintains property damage and business interruption insurance; however, any recovery may not fully offset lost profits or increased costs during disruptions. Cybersecurity threats pose additional risks, as failures in information technology systems could disrupt operations and result in reputational harm. The company has implemented measures to protect against cyber attacks, but there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient. Howmet's global operations expose it to risks that could adversely affect business performance, including economic and political instability in foreign countries. The company has adopted risk management and compliance programs to address these challenges, although such measures may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. Howmet's ability to attract and retain a skilled workforce is critical for operational success, and any failure to do so could adversely impact competitiveness. The company is also subject to various legal and regulatory compliance risks, including those related to product safety and environmental matters, which could result in substantial costs and liabilities. The impact of climate change and related regulatory responses may also affect operations and profitability. Howmet's future performance depends on its ability to adapt to changing market conditions, manage risks effectively, and maintain operational continuity under challenging circumstances.

Our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has disrupted our operations to varying degrees in many markets, leading to limited operations and full store closures in some areas. While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the pandemic, it has negatively impacted our business and is expected to continue to materially affect our financial results, condition, and outlook. The further spread of COVID-19 and the requirements to take action to mitigate its spread will impact our ability to carry out business as usual and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results, as our results are sensitive to changes in consumer discretionary spending. The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to reduced customer traffic and changes in consumer spending behaviors, which could put downward pressure on margins and negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations, particularly if they face capital constraints or other factors limiting their ability to expand and develop in certain markets. The growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations. We have experienced initial business recovery as our stores gradually reopened under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving customer behaviors and expectations. We continue to invest in technologies and innovations to elevate the customer and partner experience and to drive long-term growth. By reimagining our store formats, we are moving swiftly to adapt to new customer behaviors. Our strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations, and drive long-term shareholder value, including investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience and adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a reevaluation of our store portfolio, leading to the closure of approximately 100 stores in the U.S. and Canada, with expectations to close an additional 700 stores over the next 18 months. These restructuring efforts are part of our response to the challenges posed by the pandemic and are aimed at optimizing our operations in dense metropolitan markets. Throughout the second half of fiscal 2020, we experienced improvements in comparable store sales, reflecting the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand. We have also extended more flexible development and financial terms to support our international licensees in their recovery efforts. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. We believe we are well-positioned to regain the positive business momentum we had demonstrated prior to the pandemic, absent significant COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions. Our operational flexibility and strategic response to the pandemic will be critical in navigating the challenges ahead and ensuring our organizational resilience in the face of ongoing external pressures.

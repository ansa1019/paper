We operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our manufacturing and supply chain operations, research and development efforts, and commercial operations. We have implemented work-from-home policies for a significant portion of our employees, which may negatively impact productivity and disrupt our business. The pandemic may also result in the loss of key personnel and adversely impact our sales and marketing efforts, particularly due to restrictions on access to hospitals or clinics. Our ability to manufacture products may be impaired if any of our or our collaborators' manufacturing activities are found to infringe patents of others. We rely on limited internal and contracted manufacturing and supply chain capacity, which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and advance our clinical pipeline. Expanding our manufacturing capacity will be costly and may not be completed in a timely manner, potentially delaying the launch of our products. We face risks related to the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of our products, including the potential for significant competition and the need to maintain regulatory compliance. Our business is dependent on key personnel, and significant disruptions of information technology systems could adversely affect our operations. We may need additional funding in the future, which may not be available to us, forcing us to delay, reduce, or eliminate our product development programs. Our business activities have been challenged under federal or state healthcare laws, which may subject us to civil or criminal proceedings. We are also subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, and any failure to comply could result in significant liabilities. Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business, including changes in healthcare laws and regulations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of certain products, and if these collaborations are terminated, our ability to develop and commercialize products could be materially harmed. Our financial condition is influenced by our ability to generate profits from product sales, particularly from Eylea and Dupixent, and we expect to continue incurring substantial expenses related to research and development activities. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainties that may affect our clinical trials and the timing of regulatory reviews. We have established a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure trajectories toward the future. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical to our organizational resilience. We must navigate various pressures and constraints in our operational environment, including the need for strategic adaptation and resource allocation to maintain our competitive advantage. Our organizational practices must support operational flexibility and adaptability to ensure continued performance under pressure and in response to unexpected situations.

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and we face various risks and uncertainties that could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable due to factors outside our control, including our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and services to existing customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, disrupting global supply chains and creating significant volatility in financial markets. Our dependence on third-party channel partners for substantially all of our revenue poses risks, as a small number of distributors represent a large percentage of our revenue and gross accounts receivable. We are susceptible to supply shortages and disruptions, long lead times for components, and manufacturing delays, which could impair our ability to fulfill orders and negatively impact our operating results. Our industry is highly competitive, requiring us to accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to technological and market developments and changing end-customer needs. The effectiveness of our sales organization is critical, as we depend on our sales personnel to obtain new end-customers and sell additional products and services. We may experience turnover in our management-level personnel, and our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may enhance the severity and unpredictability of various risks, including disruptions in our channel or termination of relationships with important channel partners. Our ability to manage our inventory effectively is crucial, as insufficient inventory may lead to lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins. We have implemented readiness plans to maintain critical internet infrastructure, including providing free online information technology security training to help narrow the security skills gap. Our business model relies on selling security solutions to distributors and service providers, which requires us to manage relationships with these partners effectively. We are also subject to risks associated with international sales and operations, including economic or political instability in foreign markets and compliance with foreign laws and regulations. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to risks related to quality assurance, costs, supply, and timing. The complexity of our products and the rapid evolution of the network security market necessitate continuous innovation and adaptation to meet customer demands. We must ensure that our internal systems and processes can support our growth and operational needs, particularly in response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our ability to execute our strategy and maintain profitability may be impacted by various external pressures, including changes in market conditions, customer purchasing behavior, and regulatory requirements. We must also navigate the complexities of managing our supply chain, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations, and addressing potential disruptions caused by natural disasters or geopolitical events. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing of investments, and the overall economic environment.

Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty, which can adversely affect our organizational health and resilience. The global pandemic has adversely impacted nearly all aspects of our business and markets, including our workforce and operations, highlighting the need for effective crisis management and adaptability. We may experience material financial or operational impacts, including significant volatility or reductions in demand for our products, which necessitates a proactive approach to resource allocation and operational flexibility. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the actions taken to mitigate its effects. Our continued growth and success depend on our ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products in a timely manner, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and operational continuity. Failure to successfully innovate could render our products obsolete or less competitive, thereby impairing our performance under pressure. We actively manage a portfolio of research and development products and regularly explore potential acquisitions, which requires effective resource deployment and strategic initiatives to enhance our resilience. The success of many of our products depends upon key relationships with physicians who provide considerable knowledge and experience, emphasizing the importance of social capital and stakeholder engagement in our resilience strategies. Disruptions in manufacturing, logistics, or quality could materially adversely affect our business, necessitating robust emergency management and risk assessment practices. Our reliance on third parties for the design, manufacture, and sterilization of our products introduces additional risks, including supply interruptions that could strain our operational resources. The operation of our business depends on our information technology systems, which are vulnerable to cyber-based attacks and other disruptions, underscoring the need for effective risk management and system resilience. Our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel is critical to our organizational capabilities and overall success, as competition for talent is intense. The healthcare environment is highly competitive and continues to evolve, requiring us to demonstrate the full value of our differentiated products to healthcare providers and payors to maintain our market position. We are committed to developing innovative technologies and providing patient care while navigating the complexities of regulatory compliance and market dynamics. Our financial position is influenced by various external pressures, including economic conditions and healthcare legislation, which could impact our ability to achieve our major objectives. We strive to maintain operational flexibility and adaptability in response to these challenges, ensuring that we can confront adversity and sustain performance even under extreme conditions. As we continue to invest in our operations and strategic planning, we remain focused on enhancing our organizational resilience to thrive in a turbulent market landscape.

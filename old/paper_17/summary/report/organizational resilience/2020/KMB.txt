Our business faces various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate impact depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak and actions taken to contain its spread. We have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events; however, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Disruption in our supply chain or our manufacturing or distribution operations could adversely affect our business. Our ability to manufacture, distribute, and sell products is critical to our operations and is subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, epidemics, and governmental regulatory requirements, which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. This interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. Our strategy includes operations growth outside the U.S., especially in developing markets, which may enhance our resilience against external pressures. We believe that we will emerge from the COVID-19 situation well-positioned for long-term growth, though we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this global pandemic or its ultimate impact on the global economy and our business. Our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and improve operational flexibility are critical to maintaining performance under pressure. We anticipate that our growth strategy will be supported by our focus on accelerating and investing in our commercial capabilities through digital marketing, revenue growth management, consumer-inspired innovation, and strong in-market execution. Our strong legacy of financial discipline supports our growth strategy by driving ongoing supply chain productivity through our focused programs aimed at reducing costs everywhere. The ability to adapt to changing consumer demand and market conditions is essential for our organizational resilience, as is our capacity to manage foreign market risks effectively. The inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business and consolidated financial condition. We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all the countries in which we do business, and compliance is critical to maintaining our reputation and operational continuity. Our internal control policies and procedures are designed to protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents, but there can be no assurance that these measures will always be effective. We recognize that our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with consumers, customers, suppliers, and others, and any adverse publicity could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products. The resilience of our organization is reflected in our ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, which is essential for our survival and growth in a turbulent market environment.

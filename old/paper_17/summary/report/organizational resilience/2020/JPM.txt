JPMorgan Chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program intended to enable recovery of critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology, and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. The firm recognizes that its ability to respond effectively to a business interruption could be hampered if the workforce, physical assets, or systems needed to address the event are geographically dispersed or concentrated in a critical area. The firm’s operational systems depend on effective functioning, which includes the quality of information contained within those systems, and any disruption could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets. The effectiveness of operational systems is critical for providing services and liquidity to clients, and any failure could lead to significant operational costs, client dissatisfaction, and regulatory fines. The firm faces numerous operational risks, including those associated with the introduction of new products or changes to existing services, which could lead to increased operational expenses and reputational harm. Furthermore, the firm experiences numerous attempted cyber attacks, which could disrupt operations and result in significant harm to clients and customers. The firm also acknowledges that the effectiveness of its risk management framework may not be sufficient to identify and mitigate every risk, exposing it to unexpected losses. Heightened regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs are ongoing challenges, particularly as the firm adapts to evolving laws and regulations. The firm’s competitive standing could suffer if management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, which are critical for addressing changing market conditions and stakeholder expectations. The firm’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is essential for maintaining operational effectiveness, and unfavorable changes in immigration policies could adversely affect its workforce. Additionally, the firm’s operations could be materially affected by local economic, political, regulatory, and social factors in the countries where it conducts business, which could lead to significant disruptions. The firm recognizes the importance of maintaining trust with clients and stakeholders, as damage to its reputation could have significant adverse effects on its business prospects. The firm’s operational flexibility is also tested by environmental perturbations and other external pressures, which necessitate ongoing adaptation and resilience strategies. The firm’s participation in government programs designed to support individuals and businesses impacted by economic disruptions could expose it to increased scrutiny and operational costs. The firm’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is complex, and failures in this area could lead to regulatory investigations and reputational damage. Overall, JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to a multitude of risks that require effective management and strategic foresight to ensure resilience and continuity in the face of adversity.

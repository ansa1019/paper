The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could delay the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, impacting our ability to complete the merger and potentially leading to significant operational challenges. Our business continuity program has been effective to date, allowing us to continue operations during the pandemic; however, maintaining a remote work environment for an extended period may adversely affect productivity and our ability to meet client needs. We regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. A disaster on a significant scale could materially interrupt our business operations and result in financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability. We face increased vulnerability due to the extent of our reliance on a remote working environment, and while there has not been a material adverse effect from cyber threats to date, the risk remains significant. Our divisions are actively engaged in analyzing and providing views on the quickly evolving economic conditions, and we are taking actions consistent with our business procedures in response to these conditions. The integration of S&P Global and IHS Markit may present challenges, including managing a larger, more complex combined business, maintaining employee morale, and retaining key management and other employees. The success of the merger will depend on our ability to combine and integrate existing businesses without materially disrupting customer, supplier, and employee relations. We are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect our operations. Our ability to realize anticipated benefits from the merger is subject to risks, including whether we will perform as expected and the possibility of assuming unintended liabilities. The integration process may result in material challenges, including unforeseen expenses or delays, which could materially affect the combined company's business and financial condition. We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and the protection of confidential information, as our operations rely on secure processing, storage, and transmission of sensitive data. Any breaches could result in reputational harm, loss of customer confidence, and increased expenses related to addressing such incidents. We have made significant investments to maintain cybersecurity preparedness, but there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient. Our operations are also impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in financial markets, which can undermine business confidence and affect our results. The ongoing health crisis has introduced volatility and uncertainty into the global capital and commodities markets, and the extent to which the pandemic will continue to affect our business remains uncertain. We are committed to improving our risk culture by maturing risk management and compliance processes, and we continue to focus on enhancing our foundational capabilities while pursuing growth via strategic initiatives. The strategic response to environmental perturbations and unexpected situations is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring organizational resilience.

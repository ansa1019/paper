Our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2020 may contain forward-looking statements regarding anticipated future events, including our plans and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to severely and adversely affect our sales and operations, and we expect it to continue to have serious adverse effects on our business and financial performance. The situation is unprecedented and rapidly changing, with unknown duration and severity, requiring us to adapt and change our operational measures over time. We have implemented various measures in our stores and distribution centers to keep our associates and customers safe, which include enhanced cleaning, sanitation, and physical distancing practices. These measures are challenging to implement, and there is significant risk and uncertainty regarding their effectiveness and compliance. The pandemic has also impacted our ability to adequately staff our distribution centers and stores, potentially leading to further disruptions. The prolonged pandemic has adversely impacted global economies, which may reduce consumer demand for our products and affect our profitability, cash flows, and financial results. We anticipate that the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition in fiscal 2021 and potentially beyond. We have taken measures to preserve our financial liquidity, including borrowing from our revolving credit facility and completing a senior notes offering to enhance our financial flexibility due to uncertain market conditions. Our ability to adapt to changing consumer behaviors and preferences is critical, as unexpected changes could adversely affect our sales and margins. We face intense competitive pressures in the retail industry, which is highly fragmented, and our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand. We continually evaluate our operational strategies to maintain and improve profitability and financial returns over the long term. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic requires us to monitor market share trends and consumer behaviors closely. We must effectively manage our inventories and markdowns to address potential inventory imbalances and ensure operational continuity. Our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our off-price model in current markets and entering new geographic regions, which involves significant risks. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated changes in our operational management and strategic initiatives, including temporary furloughs for associates and adjustments to our store operations. We have also negotiated rent deferrals and abatements for our temporarily closed stores, reflecting our need to adapt to the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Our ability to recover from these challenges will depend on our organizational resilience, including our capacity to reconfigure our operations and respond effectively to external pressures. The impacts of the pandemic have highlighted the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and the need for ongoing assessment of our business strategies in response to evolving market conditions.

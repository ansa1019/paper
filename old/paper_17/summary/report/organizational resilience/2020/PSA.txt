We have significant exposure to real estate risk, which includes natural disasters or terrorist attacks that could cause damage to our facilities, resulting in increased costs and reduced revenues. The consequences of climate change, including severe weather events, could result in increased capital expenditures, increased expenses, and reduced revenues. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is crucial. We face significant competition for suitable acquisition properties from other real estate investors, which may adversely affect our growth and financial results. Failures or unexpected circumstances in integrating facilities that we acquire could jeopardize the realization of anticipated earnings from an acquisition. Our self-storage facilities generate most of our revenue and earnings, and significant competition from self-storage operators may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers. We are subject to risks from the COVID pandemic, including potential out-migration from high-cost markets, which could negatively impact occupancies and revenues. We have taken significant steps to ensure safety while keeping our services available to the public, including implementing a touchless rental platform and enforcing social distancing requirements. Our corporate offices migrated to a "work from home" environment during the pandemic, and we expect to adapt to ongoing changes in customer behavior and market conditions. Our marketing and pricing strategies may fail to be effective due to increased competition and regulatory constraints. The failure or disruption of our computer and communications systems could significantly harm our business, and we are heavily dependent on technology to manage operations. We are also subject to various legal and regulatory actions that may divert management's time and attention or restrict our operations. Our ability to raise capital to fund our activities may be adversely affected by challenging market conditions, and economic downturns could impact our financial results and access to capital. We believe our financial flexibility allows us to adapt to changing conditions and opportunities, and we have significant access to capital markets to fund growth initiatives. We are actively seeking to acquire additional self-storage facilities, and our development and expansion projects are expected to continue despite challenges such as obtaining building permits. Our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to external pressures is essential for our long-term success. We have a pipeline of development projects and expect to continue to seek additional projects to enhance our competitive position. Our organizational capabilities and strategic initiatives are designed to ensure resilience in the face of adversity, enabling us to confront challenges and sustain performance under pressure.

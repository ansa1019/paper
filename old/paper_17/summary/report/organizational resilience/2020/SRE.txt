When evaluating our company and its subsidiaries, it is important to consider the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Our ability to pay dividends and meet our debt obligations largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries, which are separate legal entities that may not be obligated to pay dividends or make distributions to us under certain circumstances. The inability to access capital from our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted communities, supply chains, and markets, leading to significant operational modifications, including employee travel and work location adjustments. If these measures continue, we could experience decreased efficiency and productivity, jeopardizing our ability to sustain operations and satisfy compliance requirements. Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, and other disruptive events could materially adversely affect our businesses and financial condition. Our facilities and infrastructure may be damaged by such events, which could result in severe business disruptions and significant additional costs. The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations, and any failure to reach agreements on labor contracts could result in strikes or other labor disruptions, adversely affecting our operations. We face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive information and the integrity of our energy infrastructure. Despite our efforts, we are not fully insulated from cyber-attacks or system disruptions, which could lead to energy delivery service failures and reputational loss. Our businesses are subject to governmental regulations that may undergo significant changes, impacting how we conduct our business and increasing operating costs. The ability to recover costs associated with regulatory compliance is uncertain and could adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations require numerous permits and approvals, and failure to obtain or maintain these could materially adversely affect our businesses. The risks associated with our investments in entities we do not control or manage could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted regulatory measures that could reduce payments received from customers and increase uncollectible accounts, which may become material. We are actively monitoring the effects of the pandemic and may take further actions to adapt our business operations. Our strategic initiatives and capital expenditures are subject to various risks, including obtaining necessary approvals and managing the impacts of environmental regulations. We expect to make significant capital investments, primarily in transmission and distribution improvements, and our ability to finance these investments will depend on maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. The potential for increased and more severe wildfires poses a significant risk to our operations, particularly in California, and could lead to increased liabilities and costs. Our ability to recover costs associated with wildfire mitigation efforts is uncertain, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our financial condition. The changing regulatory landscape and competitive environment necessitate ongoing adaptation and strategic foresight to ensure organizational resilience and operational continuity.

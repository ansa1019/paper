We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal, regulatory, and reputational risks. Our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate, and unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can negatively impact client activity, which adversely affects many of our businesses. Our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally. We seek to maintain strong capital ratios and liquidity while managing our operational resources effectively. Our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from market-making, investing, or lending positions with our exposure to potential losses. We employ a variety of risk measures to monitor market risk, including value-at-risk (var) and stress tests, to assess our exposure to adverse market movements. 

We have established a comprehensive risk management framework that includes governance, processes, and people to ensure effective management of risks. Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have sufficient funding to meet our obligations even during periods of market stress. We maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines our responses to liquidity crises, including pre-funding our estimated cash and collateral needs. Our global core liquid assets (gcla) are maintained to cover outflows during a stressed period, and we actively manage our asset-liability profile to ensure we can meet our obligations. 

Our operational risk management framework is designed to minimize losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems. We have established policies that require our revenue-producing units and independent control functions to report and escalate operational risk events. We also conduct regular stress tests to assess our credit exposures and potential concentrations that could arise from adverse market conditions. 

We continuously evaluate our operational practices to ensure they are resilient in the face of disruptions, including those arising from external events such as natural disasters or geopolitical instability. Our businesses are increasingly expanding throughout the world, including in emerging and growth markets, and we expect this trend to continue. We recognize the importance of maintaining a strong organizational culture that emphasizes risk management and operational flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions. 

Our approach to managing credit risk includes setting exposure limits, monitoring compliance, and using credit risk mitigants such as collateral and guarantees. We regularly assess our credit exposures and perform credit reviews to evaluate the capacity and willingness of our counterparties to meet their financial obligations. Our liquidity and funding strategies are designed to ensure we can maintain operational continuity and respond effectively to unexpected situations. 

We are subject to extensive regulation, and compliance with these regulations requires significant resources and can impact our profitability. Our ability to adapt to regulatory changes and maintain a strong capital position is critical to our organizational resilience. We continuously monitor our performance under pressure and adjust our strategies to ensure we can thrive in a competitive landscape.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the ability to manage future growth effectively and improve our systems, processes, and controls. The growth and expansion of our business place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. To manage future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. Failure to manage future growth effectively could result in increased costs, disrupt existing customer relationships, reduce demand for our platform, and harm our business performance. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Factors affecting our operating results include our ability to attract and retain new end-customers, changes in market needs, price competition, and our ability to expand our business domestically and internationally. The global macroeconomic environment has been inconsistent and challenging, which may cause our end-customers to modify spending priorities or delay purchasing decisions. Our future success depends on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing end-customers, which may require sophisticated sales efforts. We may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with third-party software. Our ability to fulfill end-customers' orders may be disrupted by supply chain delays or events impacting our manufacturers. Additionally, our reliance on channel partners for sales exposes us to risks if they fail to perform. We face intense competition in our market, and our competitors may have substantial advantages that could hinder our ability to compete effectively. Our corporate culture fosters innovation and teamwork, which are critical for maintaining organizational resilience. However, as we grow, we may find it challenging to preserve these aspects of our culture, which could limit our ability to innovate and retain personnel. We must also navigate the complexities of international operations, including political, economic, and social uncertainties that could impact our business. Our ability to manage our supply chain effectively is crucial, as disruptions could adversely affect our business and operating results. We are subject to various regulatory requirements, and noncompliance could result in significant penalties. Our business is also exposed to risks from catastrophic events, which could disrupt our operations and impact our financial condition. We must continue to adapt and respond to these challenges to maintain operational continuity and achieve our strategic objectives.

The company’s future performance is substantially dependent on the success of its relationship with TCCC, which has become our preferred distribution partner globally. The transition of distribution rights to TCCC's network may reduce distributor diversification, increasing reliance on TCCC's domestic and international distribution platforms. The company may fail to recognize the expected benefits of the new distribution arrangements, which could adversely affect operating results and the value of the company’s common shares. Competitive pressures in the energy drink category could impact revenues, cause price erosion, and lower market share, adversely affecting business and results of operations. The company has acquired additional brands in the energy drink category, which may encounter difficulties managing different and potentially competing brands in shared markets. The company faces risks associated with government regulation, including proposed legislation that could restrict the sale of energy drinks and limit caffeine content, which may reduce demand for its products. The company is subject to risks of investigations and enforcement actions by government agencies, which could lead to fines or product recalls, adversely affecting business and financial condition. The company’s ability to compete successfully depends on its ability to innovate and provide new products, which is influenced by changing consumer preferences and health concerns. The beverage industry is highly competitive, and the company must continue to develop and introduce innovative beverages to retain and expand market share. The company recognizes the risks associated with economic uncertainty and the potential impact on consumer purchasing power, which could reduce demand for its products. The company’s growth strategy includes expanding its international business, which exposes it to risks inherent in conducting operations in foreign markets, including economic and political instability. The company relies on bottlers and distributors to manufacture and distribute products, and any disruptions in these relationships could adversely affect business. The company must maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, as failures in these areas could materially harm business and stock value. The company’s success is also dependent on the retention of senior management, and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect operations. Climate change poses risks to the company’s business, as changing weather patterns could impact agricultural productivity and increase costs of key ingredients. The company must manage its information technology systems effectively to avoid disruptions that could negatively impact operations and customer relationships. The company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans and general operating activities is critical, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect operating results. The company’s organizational practices and strategic initiatives are designed to enhance resilience and adaptability in the face of external pressures and competitive challenges.

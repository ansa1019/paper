In deciding whether to invest in AIG, one should carefully consider the risk factors that could have a significant or material adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, potentially exacerbating the effects of others. Difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may materially and adversely affect AIG's businesses, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The organization is highly dependent on the economic environment, both in the U.S. and around the world, with extreme market events leading to a lack of liquidity, highly volatile markets, and erosion of investor confidence. The company faces pressures from external factors, including fiscal and monetary policies, oil prices, and economic growth in major regions, which could adversely affect liquidity and increase volatility. Under challenging conditions, AIG could experience reduced demand for products and elevated incidences of claims, increased policy cancellations, and lapses. The organization has a significant exposure to various industries and geographic regions, and events or developments negatively affecting specific sectors may adversely impact investments. AIG manages concentration risks by monitoring exposures and utilizing reinsurance, hedging, and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures exceeding desired thresholds. The management of these risks is critical to maintaining operational flexibility and organizational health. The company recognizes the importance of effective risk management strategies, including internal knowledge sharing and collaboration, to enhance resilience against disruptive events. The restructuring initiatives aim to improve operational and organizational efficiency, although there is a risk that anticipated expense reductions may not be fully realized. The organization is also subject to regulatory changes that may impact operations and profitability. AIG's liquidity risk management framework is designed to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet obligations, with regular assessments of liquidity sources and uses. The company actively monitors market conditions and adjusts strategies accordingly to maintain resilience. The financial strength ratings of AIG's subsidiaries are indicative of their ability to meet obligations, and any downgrades could adversely affect operations. The organization has established a risk governance structure to foster a culture of risk awareness and accountability, with oversight from the board of directors and senior management. AIG's enterprise risk management department supervises and integrates risk management functions, ensuring that risks are identified, assessed, and managed effectively. The company employs various risk measurement and monitoring techniques, including stress testing and scenario analysis, to evaluate potential impacts on liquidity and capital. The focus on maintaining a strong capital position and effective resource allocation supports AIG's resilience strategies, enabling the organization to adapt to changing market conditions and external pressures while striving for operational continuity and positive adjustment under adversity.

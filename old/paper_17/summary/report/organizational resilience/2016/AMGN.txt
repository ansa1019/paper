This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Our business is subject to risks that affect many other companies, including employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events, and international operations. We face pressures from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans, which may affect our profitability and limit our ability to set or increase the price of our products based on their value. Changes to U.S. federal reimbursement policy may arise from legislative actions, which could adversely impact our business. The consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers exerting greater pressure in pricing negotiations, significantly increasing discounts and rebates and limiting patient access to our products. We also face risks related to the reporting of pricing data that affects reimbursement for our products, and incorrect submissions may lead to substantial fines and penalties. Our products face substantial competition, and we operate in a highly competitive environment, which may make it difficult to successfully discover, develop, and market new products. Legislative or regulatory changes that decrease coverage or reimbursement available for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal authorities, and failure to comply may result in administrative sanctions or reputational harm. Our ability to manufacture and supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, which may be impacted by natural disasters, compliance with regulatory requirements, and other operational challenges. We are also increasingly dependent on information technology systems, which face risks from cyber-attacks that could adversely affect our business operations and data security. Global economic conditions may negatively affect our operations and performance, as financial pressures may lead third-party payers to seek cost containment measures. The concentration of purchasing power among certain distributors may negatively impact our business due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products. We continue to invest in transformation and process improvement initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and reallocate resources to support innovative pipeline opportunities. Our transformation efforts are aimed at establishing a foundation for long-term growth and improving our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. We believe that our existing funds, cash generated from operations, and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital and strategic initiatives. However, we must remain vigilant in managing risks associated with regulatory changes, competitive pressures, and operational disruptions to ensure organizational resilience and maintain our performance under challenging conditions.

An investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties, including market-wide and unique risks specific to our business. Our revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government, and this relationship involves specific risks, including the potential for changes in government defense spending, which could impact our financial performance. The annual budget process for U.S. government contracts may be delayed or disrupted, affecting funding for our programs. U.S. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and funding is subject to disruption or delay. Changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. Our contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings. The highly regulated environment in which government contractors operate includes audits that can result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed. Our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand, and our future performance depends on our ability to develop innovative products and technologies to meet evolving customer needs. We manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues, as reliance on a limited number of suppliers could adversely affect our ability to meet commitments. Our non-U.S. business may be sensitive to changes in foreign government budgets and national priorities, which could arise suddenly. We face various cyber security threats that could disrupt our operations and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive systems. We maintain information security staff and policies to manage risk to our information systems. Our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce. We continue to focus on improving operating earnings and expanding margins while anticipating trends and reacting to changing circumstances in our business environment. We emphasize effective program execution and seek opportunities to drive cost-reduction activities across our business. The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to military funding priorities and our ability to evolve products to address a fast-changing threat environment. Our financial performance is impacted by U.S. government spending levels, particularly defense spending, which has been mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011. We continue to pursue international opportunities presented by demand for military equipment and information technologies. Our backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $59.8 billion at the end of 2016, reflecting stability for future operations. We recognize the importance of adapting to environmental changes and maintaining operational flexibility to ensure resilience in our business strategy. Our ability to perform on contracts relies on effective resource allocation and management of subcontractor performance. We are committed to enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience strategies to navigate complex situations and external pressures effectively.

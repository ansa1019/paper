JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology, and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the firm or its customers and clients. Any failures or disruptions of the firm's systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the firm's business and results of operations by subjecting the firm to losses or liability, or require the firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties, or losses not covered by insurance. The firm's businesses are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals, and ensuring compliance with these regulations can increase the firm's operating costs and impact the development of new products or services. The firm relies on the effectiveness and integrity of its processes, operational systems, and employees, and certain failures of such processes or systems, or errors or misconduct by such employees, could materially and adversely affect the firm's operations. The firm's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss, but there are inherent limitations to the firm's risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. The firm's operational flexibility is critical to its ability to adapt to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. The firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, and these processes are critical to the firm's financial results and condition. The firm's ability to manage its resources effectively is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring operational continuity. The firm expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense, and ongoing or increased competition may require the firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses. The firm is also subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. The firm's operations are subject to risks of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary, and political developments, and any significant failure by the firm's management to anticipate and respond quickly to changes in the operating environment could adversely affect its competitive standing and future results of operations. The firm's strategic initiatives and resource allocation decisions are critical for navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational effectiveness. The firm must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs, and a violation could subject it to regulatory enforcement actions and significant penalties. The firm's employees are its most important resource, and competition for qualified personnel is intense; the firm's ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success. The firm must also manage potential conflicts of interest and ensure that its employees comply with the firm's code of conduct to maintain trust and reputation in the financial services industry.

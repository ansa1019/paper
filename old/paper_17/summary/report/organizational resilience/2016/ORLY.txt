Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including adverse changes in economic conditions that may impact demand for our products and the financial health of our customers. The economic health of our customers is influenced by factors such as general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, and consumer confidence, which are largely outside of our control. Restrictions on access to telematics and diagnostic tools may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers for maintenance and repairs, potentially impacting our business continuity. Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, which could adversely affect our sales, particularly during extreme weather events that discourage customer visits to our stores. We believe our ability to open additional profitable stores will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives, which depend on external factors such as weather conditions and general business conditions. Our success is largely dependent on retaining and motivating key personnel, as the unexpected loss of key employees could materially affect our operational flexibility and efficiency. Our relationships with suppliers and their ability to provide quality products at favorable prices are critical to our financial health, and disruptions in these relationships could negatively impact our operations. We expect to continue making acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, but these acquisitions involve risks that could affect our profitability and operational integration. Business interruptions in our distribution centers or facilities may affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores, resulting in lost sales and potential loss of customer loyalty. Our reliance on computer systems for inventory management and transaction processing exposes us to risks from interruptions or failures, which could negatively impact our performance. We have built a strong brand reputation, and maintaining high levels of product and service quality is essential to preserving this value. Our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities for cost reduction is critical to our success, especially in light of external pressures such as employment legislation and healthcare reform. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at adapting our product offerings to changing customer preferences and enhancing our service capabilities. Our liquidity and capital resources are influenced by our ability to generate cash flows from operations, which may be affected by changes in customer buying patterns. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity needs, but there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Our financial performance is subject to fluctuations based on market conditions and our ability to meet analysts' expectations. The occurrence of risks related to litigation, regulatory inquiries, and environmental legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We are committed to evaluating and mitigating potential impacts from these risks to ensure our organizational resilience and adaptability in a challenging business environment.

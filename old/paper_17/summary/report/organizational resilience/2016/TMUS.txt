Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by various risks, including competition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services. We expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry's customer growth rate to be moderate, leading to ongoing competition for customers. Our ability to compete will depend on continued improvement in network quality and customer services, effective marketing, and cost management, all of which will involve significant expenses. We are actively seeking to make additional investments in spectrum to support customer growth and maintain quality of service. The continued interest in and acquisition of spectrum by existing carriers may reduce our ability to acquire necessary spectrum, impacting our competitive position and ability to grow. Our business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates and consumer confidence, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We rely on both our systems and networks and those of other providers to deliver services, and failures in these systems could disrupt our operations. We face risks from unauthorized access to confidential information, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business or damage our reputation. The telecommunications industry is subject to significant regulatory oversight, and changes in regulations could impose new costs or require changes in operations. We depend heavily on suppliers and third parties for the operation of our business, and disruptions in their performance could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Our ability to generate cash in the future will depend on our operational performance, which is subject to various risks. We must maintain effective internal controls to prevent inaccuracies in financial reporting, and any failure in this area could result in a loss of investor confidence. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, as our future success depends on our ability to recruit and develop talented employees. We may pursue acquisitions or mergers, which could present financial, managerial, and operational challenges. Our financial performance will be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing or subscriptions. We are implementing a new billing system that may cause operational disruptions if not executed effectively. Our liquidity requirements are driven by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and network infrastructure, and we expect to incur significant costs related to these investments. We regularly review and update our projections for liquidity needs based on anticipated financial and operating performance. Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our operating environment. We have entered into arrangements to sell certain accounts receivable as a source of liquidity, and we may seek additional sources of liquidity to meet our operational needs. We are committed to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to changes in the business environment to ensure organizational resilience.

This section highlights specific risks that could affect our business, including general economic and market risks, changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment, and geopolitical matters that may impact financial markets and the economy. Adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, including changes in payment patterns, increases in delinquencies and default rates, and limitations on our ability to recover debt previously charged-off. The process and models used to estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses may become less reliable if actual losses diverge from projections due to changes in customer behavior or volatile economic conditions. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or engage in funding transactions could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets, which could limit our access to funding. Compliance with new and existing laws and regulations may increase costs, reduce revenue, and limit business opportunities, while establishing systems to achieve compliance may further increase costs. We face risks related to our operational, technological, and organizational infrastructure, which are critical to retaining and attracting customers. Our ability to build or acquire necessary infrastructure or adapt to technological advances is challenged by the fast pace of digital transformation. Operational risk can manifest in various ways, including errors related to inadequate processes, fraud, and exposure to external events. We depend on the strength and availability of technology systems to manage internal financial systems and interface with customers. Disruptions to these systems could materially affect our business and reputation. We recognize that compliance requirements are increasingly complex, and we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment to adjust our compliance risk program. Our credit risk management involves sound underwriting practices, continuous monitoring of our portfolio, and taking steps to collect or work out distressed loans. The chief risk officer is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, and we employ a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors to manage credit risk. We monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess credit risk exposure, focusing on delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's estimate of incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolios, and we regularly review and assess our methodologies for determining this allowance. Our liquidity management practices ensure we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand potential impacts from deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in funding markets. We maintain adequate liquidity reserves and access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile markets. Our market risk management policies include using derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk, with a focus on maintaining a balance between near-term earnings volatility and market value volatility. We employ value-at-risk as a primary method to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities, and we regularly evaluate and enhance our assumptions and models used in measuring interest rate risk sensitivity. The sensitivity analysis of interest rate movements on projected net interest income and economic value of equity demonstrates our asset sensitivity in certain rate scenarios, while highlighting the limitations of market risk measures based on historical data and management judgment.

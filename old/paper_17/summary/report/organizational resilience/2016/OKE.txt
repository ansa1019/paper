Our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of Oneok Partners, which is our primary cash-generating source. A significant decline in Oneok Partners' earnings and/or cash distributions could have a corresponding negative impact on us. Our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations, making it more difficult to withstand a downturn in our business or the economy. We are subject to provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the merger transaction and could discourage a potential acquirer from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal. The merger transaction is subject to conditions and may not be consummated, which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results. We may not realize the benefits we expect from the merger transaction, and our assessments and expectations regarding the anticipated benefits may prove to be incorrect. Our ability to make strategic acquisitions and investments will depend on various factors, including access to capital and the extent to which acquisition opportunities become available. If we or Oneok Partners are unable to make strategic investments and acquisitions, our future growth may be limited, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our established risk-management policies and procedures may not be effective, and employees may violate our risk-management policies, exposing us to greater risk than intended. We have developed and implemented a comprehensive set of policies and procedures to assist us in managing risks associated with our business segments. However, as conditions change and become more complex, current risk measures may fail to adequately assess the relevant risk due to changes in the market and the presence of previously unknown risks. Our operations are subject to market and credit risks, and we are exposed to commodity price fluctuations, which could result in our inability to fulfill contractual obligations. The capital and global credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption, which may have an adverse effect on us or Oneok Partners. If we or Oneok Partners are unable to access capital at competitive rates, our ability to enhance the earnings potential of our existing assets may be adversely affected. Our businesses are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions, including adverse weather conditions, accidents, and catastrophic events, which could materially adversely affect our business. We are also subject to strict regulations regarding employee safety, and failure to comply with these regulations could affect our financial position and results of operations. The demand for our services is influenced by various external factors, including economic conditions and competition from other energy suppliers. Our ability to recover operating costs and amounts equivalent to income taxes is dependent on regulatory actions, and changes in regulations could have an adverse impact on our business. We are also subject to environmental regulations that may impose significant costs and liabilities, and our operations are subject to risks associated with the handling of hazardous materials. Our ability to maintain effective internal controls is crucial for reliable financial reporting, and any failure to maintain these controls could harm our operating results. The impact of new accounting standards and changes in market conditions may also affect our financial performance.

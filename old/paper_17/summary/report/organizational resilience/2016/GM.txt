We face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. The automotive industry is expected to experience significant and continued change, requiring us to be responsive to new technologies, products, and business models introduced by both traditional and non-traditional participants. Our long-term profitability depends upon successfully creating and funding technological innovations in design, engineering, and manufacturing, which requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent. Our profitability is dependent upon the success of full-size pick-up trucks and SUVs, and any shift in consumer preferences could weaken demand for these higher-margin vehicles. We operate in a highly competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. Our business is highly sensitive to sales volume, which can be volatile and influenced by various economic and market conditions. Maintaining a strong position in competitive markets, such as China, is a key component of our global growth strategy, and we are subject to aggressive competition that may result in price reductions and reduced margins. Our international operations expose us to various domestic and foreign political, economic, and regulatory risks, including changes in laws or regulations that could impact our business model. We are also subject to extensive laws and regulations regarding fuel economy and emissions controls, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business. Our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and disruptions to our information technology networks is critical to maintaining operational continuity. We rely on our suppliers to deliver the necessary components for production, and any disruption in their operations could impact our production schedules. Our operational flexibility is constrained by a high proportion of fixed costs, which may exacerbate risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles. We continue to implement operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs, which are essential for our future competitiveness. Our strategic plan includes initiatives aimed at achieving operational efficiencies and responding to the pressures of a competitive landscape. We are continuing to assess our performance and may require additional restructuring actions in response to challenging market conditions. Our liquidity plans are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and we continue to monitor opportunities to strengthen our competitive position while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is vital for our survival and growth in turbulent markets. We are committed to fostering inter-organizational collaboration and strategic initiatives that enhance our resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity.

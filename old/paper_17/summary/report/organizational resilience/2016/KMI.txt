Our businesses are dependent on the supply of and demand for the commodities that we handle, which impacts our ability to adapt and respond to external pressures. The successful integration of acquired companies or assets involves managing operations and eliminating redundant costs, which is crucial for maintaining operational flexibility and achieving strategic objectives. We regularly undertake major construction projects to expand our existing assets, and various factors outside of our control can cause delays or increased costs, affecting our overall performance and resilience. Our ability to begin and complete construction on expansion projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining permits and rights-of-way, public opposition, and other delays, which can impact our operational continuity. Financial distress experienced by our customers or other counterparties could adversely affect us if they are unable to fulfill their obligations, highlighting the importance of risk assessment and mitigation strategies. The volatility of commodity prices can have a material adverse effect on our operations, necessitating effective crisis management and response strategies. Our business strategy includes focusing on stable, fee-based energy transportation and storage assets that are central to the energy infrastructure of growing markets, which supports our resilience in turbulent markets. We leverage economies of scale from incremental acquisitions and expansions of assets that fit within our strategy and are accretive to cash flow, thus enhancing our competitive advantage. Our operational resources and financial health are influenced by our substantial debt, which makes us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions. We must obtain and maintain rights to construct and operate pipelines on other owners' land, and if we are unable to secure these rights, our operations could be disrupted, impacting our organizational health. Our business model is built to support long-term value creation for shareholders while ensuring we can confront and adapt to unexpected situations. We engage in hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure. The integration of new properties and businesses is part of our growth strategy, and successful adaptation to changing market conditions is critical for our organizational success. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline integrity, which require us to develop and maintain management programs to ensure safety and reliability. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is a key aspect of our resilience strategy. We regularly evaluate our performance and prospects, considering various factors that could affect our ability to achieve our major objectives and maintain operational effectiveness. Our commitment to sustainability and proactive measures in crisis response are integral to our organizational resilience, enabling us to navigate complex situations and maintain our competitive position in the market.

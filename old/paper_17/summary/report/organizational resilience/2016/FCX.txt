This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of United States federal securities laws. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include financial risks, declines in market prices, and operational adjustments in response to market conditions. Beginning in 2015, significant declines in copper prices prompted adjustments to operating plans, including reducing operating and capital costs and adjusting production. If market prices decline or persist at low levels, further revisions to operating plans may be necessary, potentially curtailing production and leading to additional losses. Our financial results will vary with fluctuations in commodity prices, which are influenced by complex factors beyond our control. The level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could limit financial and operational flexibility, increasing vulnerability to adverse economic conditions and limiting the ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures. Compliance with environmental regulations imposes substantial costs and may constrain operations or expansion opportunities. Our operations are subject to extensive regulations that could delay or suspend operations, and failure to comply with these regulations may result in significant penalties. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and could disrupt operations, leading to financial losses. Our mining operations are subject to operational risks, including natural disasters and equipment failures, which could materially affect business and cash flow. Labor unrest and civil strife could disrupt operations and adversely affect financial condition and results. The safety of our workforce is critical, and we continue to work with the government to address security issues. Our operations depend on the availability of secure water supplies, and competition for water resources may impact production. Environmental obligations are significant, and changes in regulatory requirements could increase costs. We are required to provide financial assurance for closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties, and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect. Our international operations face political, social, and geographic risks, including changes in laws and regulations that could impose onerous requirements on foreign operations. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings that could result in adverse judgments or settlements. The outcome of litigation is uncertain, and adverse developments could result in significant monetary damages or regulatory interpretations that increase operating costs. We are also subject to environmental remediation obligations from past operations, which could require substantial expenditures. Our ability to replenish mineral reserves is essential for long-term success, and exploration activities may not result in profitable discoveries. Our capital expenditures are expected to be significant, and changes in costs or timing could adversely affect project economics. The economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including commodity prices and estimated costs. We must continually assess the carrying values of our long-lived assets, and changes in market conditions could lead to impairment charges. Our operations are subject to extensive regulations, and compliance with these laws is integral and costly. The potential physical impacts of climate change on operations are uncertain, and increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may raise costs. Our ability to respond to environmental and operational challenges is critical for maintaining performance and achieving strategic objectives.

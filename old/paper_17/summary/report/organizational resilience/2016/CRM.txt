The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial information and other personally identifiable information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and possible liability. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, our customers' data, or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords, or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data, our data, or our IT systems. Because we do not control our customers or third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties. The internet's infrastructure is comprised of many different networks and services that are highly fragmented and distributed by design. This infrastructure is run by a series of independent third-party organizations that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting services of the internet. The internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure, denial-of-service attacks, or related cyber incidents, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage or result in fragmentation of the internet, resulting in multiple separate internets. These scenarios are not under our control and could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internet-based services. We have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services, and such interruptions may occur in the future. Interruptions in our services may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. As part of our current disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, our production environment and all of our customers' data are currently replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that additional investments in our internal infrastructure, data center capacity, research, customer support and development, and real estate spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas, and to scale with our overall growth. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we will be unable to execute our business plan.

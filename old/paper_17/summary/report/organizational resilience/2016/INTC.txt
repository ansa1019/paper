The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Changes in product demand can adversely affect our financial results, and demand for our products is variable and hard to predict. Important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes in business conditions, consumer confidence, competitive and pricing pressures, customer product needs, and the technology supply chain. We face significant competition, and if we do not anticipate and respond to technological and market developments, our competitive position may weaken. Our business focus has expanded to include the design and production of platforms and other products for various market segments, which requires cultivating new industry relationships and continually improving our products. Despite ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services. Our R&D efforts are critical to our success and aimed at solving complex problems, but we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully. Our operations are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions, including economic conditions, geopolitical issues, natural disasters, and government restrictions. We maintain business recovery plans intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business; however, some of our systems are not fully redundant, and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations could be disrupted by various factors, including natural disasters, industrial accidents, cybersecurity incidents, or interruptions of service from utilities. While we maintain a program of insurance coverage for various risks, losses not covered by insurance may be large, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks due to variability in demand and the complexity of our manufacturing operations, which may hinder our ability to respond to fluctuations in demand. Our manufacturing operations may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, and we rely on third-party providers for manufacturing and assembly, which could lead to supply delays or disruptions. We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties, and any material change in our relationship with these distributors could reduce our revenue. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. We are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks, as third parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network and products. We are also subject to risks associated with transactions, including investments in companies for strategic reasons that may not yield expected returns. Our acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives and disrupt our ongoing business. We must manage risks related to our use of distributors and other third parties, as failure to do so may reduce sales and weaken our competitive position.

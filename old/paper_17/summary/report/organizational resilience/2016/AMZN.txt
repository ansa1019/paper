We face intense competition as our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, which may limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Our expansion places a significant strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources, increasing the complexity of our business and potentially damaging our reputation. We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate, as our revenue growth may not be sustainable and is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. Our international operations expose us to numerous risks, including local economic and political conditions, government regulation, and restrictive governmental actions, which could adversely impact our business continuity and operational flexibility. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and limit our growth. Our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers is critical, as is our ability to offer products on favorable terms and manage inventory. We seek to optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers to mitigate risks associated with customer demand and operational management. Our reliance on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory and completed orders could negatively impact our operating results if we are unable to negotiate acceptable terms or if they experience performance problems. We face significant inventory risk due to seasonality, new product launches, and rapid changes in consumer demand, which may adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could expose us to claims and legal proceedings that may result in significant financial and managerial resource expenditures. Our digital content offerings depend on effective digital rights management technology, and any compromise could lead to claims and impact our operational integrity. We experience occasional system interruptions that may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services, and our systems are not fully redundant, which poses risks to our operational continuity. We seek to invest efficiently in technology and content to enhance the customer experience and improve process efficiencies, recognizing that our technology infrastructure must adapt to support increased usage. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows, driven by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty, and we continually evaluate opportunities to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical to our organizational resilience.

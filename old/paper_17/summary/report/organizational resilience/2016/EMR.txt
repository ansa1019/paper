Investing in our securities involves risks, including the potential for unforeseen developments that could delay strategic portfolio transactions or cause them to occur on less favorable terms. Our operating results depend in part on continued successful research, development, and marketing of new and/or improved products and services, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully introduce new products and services. Our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, resulting in unpredictable product transitions and increased importance of being first to market. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production, and/or marketing of new products and services, which may negatively impact our operating results. We engage in acquisitions and divestitures, which require favorable environments to execute these transactions, and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired and to cooperate with our strategic partners. Our operations depend on production facilities worldwide, which could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events. Our substantial sales abroad subject us to economic risk as our results may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations and changes in local government regulations and policies. Access to funding through the capital markets is essential to executing our business plan, and if we are unable to maintain such access, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our business success depends on the ability to attract, develop, and retain key personnel, and the failure to do so could adversely affect our operations and performance. Security breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business, as these systems are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access and cyberattacks. We are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our operating results. The company has made various strategic actions to streamline its portfolio, drive growth, and accelerate value creation for shareholders, which includes the planned separation of certain business segments. The company generated substantial cash from operations and has the resources available to reinvest for growth in existing businesses, pursue strategic acquisitions, and manage its capital structure. The company continues to monitor market prices of commodities and attempts to reduce price exposure through hedging activities. The overall economic environment remains challenging, particularly for the automation businesses, and the company expects net and underlying sales to decline. The company's financial structure provides the flexibility necessary to achieve its strategic objectives, and it has been successful in efficiently deploying cash to fund operations and sustain long-term growth. The company routinely repatriates a portion of its non-U.S. cash from earnings each year, providing for U.S. income taxes as appropriate. The company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet its needs in the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, and debt capacity.

The healthcare industry in the United States has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes, which could impact our business operations. Changes in the healthcare industry's pricing, selling, inventory, distribution, or supply policies could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. Our distribution business agreements are structured to ensure appropriate compensation for services provided; however, failure to renew these contracts favorably could adversely affect our results. The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation could impose increased costs, negatively impact profit margins, and expose the company to litigation. We are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, which could require changes in operations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties. We have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and their potential impact on operations, but there can be no assurance that these plans will eliminate negative impacts. Our business relies on secure electronic transmission and storage of sensitive information, and a failure or compromise of our systems could result in significant operational and financial consequences. We continuously monitor outstanding receivables and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt, which reflects our adaptability to changing customer financial conditions. The integration of acquisitions involves significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention and difficulties in assimilating operations, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated benefits. Our restructuring plan aims to lower operating costs, but it could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of management and reduced employee productivity. We are subject to various claims and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and the uncertainty associated with these matters could harm our business and reputation. The ongoing volatility in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access credit and the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers. We expect our available cash generated from operations and existing sources of liquidity to be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and working capital needs. However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We are also subject to risks associated with our retail expansion, which may result in increased competitive, merchandising, and distribution challenges. Our ability to expand successfully will depend on customer acceptance of our retail store experience and our ability to manage operational continuity. The proposed withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union could disrupt trade and impact our operations, and we are subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position.

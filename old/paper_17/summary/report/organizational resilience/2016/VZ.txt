The following discussion of risks is designed to highlight important factors that may adversely affect our business and expectations, including adverse economic conditions that could impact our results of operations. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending, which could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for our products and services. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our network quality, capacity, and coverage, as well as how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and changes in consumer preferences. If we are unable to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services and reduced profits. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, and other events beyond our control, which could cause significant damage to our infrastructure and result in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities could exceed the coverage we maintain. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could also have an adverse effect on our business, potentially causing equipment failures and loss of information, which may damage our reputation and adversely impact customer and investor confidence. The inability to operate our networks and systems as a result of cyber attacks may result in significant expenses and a loss of market share to other communications providers. We depend on key suppliers and vendors for equipment and services necessary to operate our business. If these suppliers fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as requested by our customers. Changes in the regulatory framework could adversely affect our business prospects, as we are subject to various regulations that may restrict our ability to operate effectively. The costs associated with maintaining our benefit plans could reduce our profitability, and our significant debt may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry. Adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and affect our access to financing. Our workforce, which includes a significant portion represented by labor unions, may incur additional costs or experience work stoppages due to labor contract renegotiations. We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements, further impacting our operational capabilities. The multifaceted nature of these risks underscores the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in the face of external pressures and disruptions, ensuring that we can respond effectively to challenges and sustain our performance under pressure.

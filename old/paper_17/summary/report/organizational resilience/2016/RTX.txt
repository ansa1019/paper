Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by various factors, including global economic, capital market and political conditions, which may adversely affect our organizational resilience. Changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks could affect our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. The tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing, potentially leading to decreased orders for our products and services. Our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries, which are influenced by external factors such as fluctuations in construction activity, regulatory changes, and global credit market conditions. A slowdown in business and consumer spending could negatively impact our operational flexibility and overall performance. Additionally, our international operations expose us to economic risks, including changes in foreign currency fluctuations and local government regulations, which could affect product demand and our competitive position. We face risks associated with supplier reliance, where disruptions in deliveries or production could adversely impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. Our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and divestitures, may encounter difficulties that could affect our organizational capabilities and anticipated benefits. The success of these transactions depends on various factors, including the ability to secure regulatory approvals and manage integration challenges. Our debt levels and related obligations could limit our flexibility in responding to changes in market conditions, impacting our resilience. Cyber-based risks and attacks on our information technology infrastructure could disrupt operations and threaten our ability to provide products and services, highlighting the need for effective crisis management and preparedness strategies. We also face litigation and compliance risks that could adversely affect our competitive position and financial condition. Our restructuring efforts aimed at cost reduction may not yield the expected efficiencies, and unforeseen delays or additional costs could impair our operational capabilities. Furthermore, changes in environmental regulations and compliance requirements could lead to increased costs and operational adjustments. Our reliance on intellectual property and the potential for infringement or failure to protect these assets could impact our future growth and success. Overall, the multifaceted nature of our operations and the various external pressures we face necessitate a strong focus on organizational resilience to navigate the complexities of the business environment and maintain performance under pressure.

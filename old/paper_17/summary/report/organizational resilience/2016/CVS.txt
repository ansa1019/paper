Our business is subject to various industry, economic, regulatory, and other risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. Competitive pressures in the pharmacy benefit management (PBM) industry have resulted in our clients sharing in a larger portion of rebates and discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers, which could adversely affect our margins. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, PBMs, and government entities to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates may impact our profitability. We face significant challenges in competing for new PBM business and retaining or renewing existing PBM business, which could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our operations depend heavily on our information systems, which are subject to damage or interruption from various threats, including cyber attacks and human error. A compromise of our information security controls could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and clients. The integration of acquired companies may be complex and time-consuming, and if not fully successful, could impede our ability to realize anticipated benefits and growth opportunities. Our ability to adapt to changing market dynamics and respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical for maintaining operational continuity and competitive advantage. The health of the economy and consumer confidence can affect our business, as unfavorable economic conditions may lead to a decline in demand for pharmacy benefit management services. We are also subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations, and changes in these laws may require extensive system and operating changes that could be difficult to implement. The possibility of client losses and the failure to win new business could adversely affect our financial results. Our business is affected by the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals as well as lower-priced generic alternatives, which are critical for maintaining profitability. Any disruption in our business operations could occur due to various factors, including supply shortages and regulatory changes. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is essential for survival and growth. We anticipate that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems, which could impact our operational practices. The competitive success of our pharmacy services business relies on establishing and maintaining contractual relationships with network pharmacies, and changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks could adversely affect our claims volume and competitiveness. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by existing and new government legislative, regulatory actions, and enforcement activity. We must continuously adapt our operational strategies to mitigate risks and enhance resilience in a highly competitive and evolving health care environment.

Our business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which may impair our business operations. A slowdown in the economic recovery or worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic developments and making it more difficult to pay or refinance our debts. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and if we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we may have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include reducing or delaying capital expenditures and limiting our growth. We have pursued a strategy of optimizing our field operations to improve sales force effectiveness and focus our efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and large customers. We have also implemented lean management techniques to achieve efficiencies and goals. Our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect, as their success depends on several factors, some beyond our control. We depend on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies on acceptable terms, and any disruption in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and we may not sell equipment at the prices or in the quantities we expect. We are exposed to various claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully cover them, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters, and any non-compliance could increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business. Our collective bargaining agreements and relationships with union-represented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers and lead to higher labor costs. We have experienced fluctuations in our revenues and operating results due to various factors, including seasonal rental patterns, changes in demand for our equipment, and economic conditions. Disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations. We have also faced challenges in integrating acquired businesses, which could affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and harm our business. Our ability to comply with covenants in our debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing. We have a holding company structure and depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness, which could limit our financial flexibility. Our ability to manage credit risk issues is crucial, as a large number of customers experiencing financial difficulties could lead to increased credit losses. Our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets. We have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions, and our failure to address the risks associated with these acquisitions could harm our business.

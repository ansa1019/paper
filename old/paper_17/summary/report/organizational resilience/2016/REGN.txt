We operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. The risks include our substantial dependence on the success of Eylea, which represents a significant portion of our revenues. If we experience difficulty with the commercialization of Eylea, our ability to sustain profitability would be materially harmed. The continued commercial success of Eylea will depend on various factors, including the effectiveness of our commercial strategy, our ability to meet demand, and maintaining sales in the face of competitive products. We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, and failure to maintain regulatory compliance could result in withdrawal of marketing approval, materially harming our business. We rely on collaboration with Bayer for the commercialization of Eylea outside the United States, and if this collaboration is terminated, our ability to develop and commercialize Eylea would be significantly adversely affected. Our sales and potential profits depend on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our business. The commercial success of our products may be adversely affected by guidelines or recommendations that result in decreased use of our products. We face significant competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and our competitors may have greater resources, which could impact our ability to maintain a competitive advantage. Our financial results may fluctuate based on various factors, including the net sales of our marketed products and the continuation of our collaborations. We expect continued increases in our expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities. The amount of funding required for our clinical programs will depend on the results of our research and preclinical programs, regulatory requirements, and the success of our collaborations. We have limited commercial capabilities outside the United States and would need to develop or outsource these capabilities, which could delay product launches. Our operations are subject to various risks, including those related to compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business. We are dependent on our key personnel, and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial organizations, our business will be harmed. Our business is increasingly dependent on critical information technology systems, and significant disruptions or breaches of data security could adversely affect our operations. We may require additional funding in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, potentially limiting our ability to continue operations. The potential for product liability claims exists, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation. Changes in laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could also adversely impact our business, and we are subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, including unfamiliar laws and regulatory requirements.

The homebuilding industry is cyclical and affected by changes in economic, real estate, and other conditions that could adversely affect business or financial results. Adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy would cause a negative impact on business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and write-offs. Weather conditions and natural disasters can harm the homebuilding business, delaying development work, home construction, and home closings, adversely affecting the cost or availability of materials or labor. Deployments of U.S. military personnel to foreign regions, terrorist attacks, and other acts of violence may cause an economic slowdown in the markets where operations are conducted, adversely affecting the homebuilding business. Public health issues such as a major epidemic or pandemic could adversely affect business, as outbreaks of contagious diseases may reduce customer traffic or demand for new homes. The company regularly assesses projected capital requirements to fund future growth, repay future debt obligations, and support operational needs, evaluating opportunities to raise additional capital. The operating strategy focuses on leveraging financial and competitive positions to increase returns on inventory investments while generating strong profitability and cash flows. This includes maintaining a strong cash balance, actively managing inventory investments, modifying product offerings, and controlling costs. The company believes its existing cash resources and credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to fund near-term working capital needs and debt obligations. Adverse changes in economic, homebuilding, or capital market conditions could negatively affect business, liquidity, and financial results. The mortgage lending industry has experienced significant change, including volatility in the secondary market and new government regulations, which could impact the availability of financing and sales of new homes. The company is subject to extensive regulations that affect land development and home construction, which can limit, delay, or increase the costs of development or home construction. The ability to obtain surety bonds is critical for securing performance under construction contracts, and any inability to obtain these bonds could adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. The company’s financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which may result in more stringent compliance standards that could adversely affect operational results. The company relies on key personnel to effectively operate and manage its businesses, and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect operations. Information technology failures and data security breaches could disrupt business operations, damage reputation, and cause financial loss. The company’s ability to maintain its debt service and other obligations will depend on future financial performance, which is subject to various risks and uncertainties. The cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry and changes in economic conditions could impact the company’s ability to adapt and respond to market demands, affecting overall performance and resilience in the face of external pressures.

Our business and operations are subject to many risks, including the volatility of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices, which can materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The substantial and extended decline in commodity prices has had a material adverse effect on us, impacting our ability to maintain our current level of dividends and potentially requiring us to incur impairment charges. Drilling operations involve numerous risks, including unexpected conditions and compliance with environmental regulations, which can lead to operational delays and increased costs. Our ability to sell and deliver production depends on the availability and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, and transportation facilities, which may not be available due to market conditions or regulatory reasons. We face intense competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, which may limit our ability to respond effectively to changes in demand and supply dynamics. The accuracy of our reserve estimates, which are critical for financial reporting and operational planning, is subject to significant uncertainties and may require adjustments based on evolving production history and economic conditions. Weather and climate conditions can significantly impact our operations, affecting both demand for our products and the operational integrity of our facilities. Our hedging activities are designed to mitigate risks associated with price fluctuations, but they may also expose us to counterparty risks and limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements. The performance of our management team is crucial for our strategic initiatives and overall organizational resilience, as their effectiveness directly influences our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. We continuously monitor and assess regulatory changes, particularly those related to environmental protection and safety, which could lead to increased compliance costs and operational constraints. Our international operations expose us to various political and economic risks, including changes in laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business. The realization of these risks could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operational flexibility, and overall resilience in the face of external pressures. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and implementing strategies that enhance our operational efficiency and adaptability to ensure long-term sustainability and success in a volatile market environment.

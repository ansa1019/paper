We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. Global economic and political conditions may impact our business, financial results, and financial condition. Adverse changes in global economic conditions could lead to customers delaying or reducing technology purchases, resulting in reductions in sales of our products and services. Our financial performance may be negatively impacted by a lack of credit available to key channel partners, counterparty failures, and decreased borrowing and spending by our end users. The transition from personal computer to cloud-based products and more flexible product licenses requires considerable investment of technical, financial, legal, and sales resources. Our ability to achieve financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties, including customer demand and our ability to develop and scale infrastructure. We are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects. The software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving customer requirements, necessitating constant evaluation of our business model and strategy. We are making investments through the development and enhancement of existing products and services, as well as through acquisitions. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which may entail cost and integration challenges. The restructuring plan aims to reduce expenses and streamline the organization to align with evolving business needs. Our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure. The failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to catastrophic events could adversely impact our business. We have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce potential impacts. Our dependency on international revenue exposes us to significant regulatory, economic, and political risks, which could adversely affect our financial results. We also rely on third-party technologies, and disruptions in these relationships could negatively impact our business. The transition to a subscription model has resulted in changes in revenue recognition, impacting financial performance. Our ability to maintain good relationships with distribution channels is critical for generating revenue. The loss of key distributors could harm our business. We anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue, and we are subject to various risks inherent in these operations. Our restructuring efforts may incur additional costs, and if we fail to realize expected outcomes, our business and operating results may be harmed. We must act quickly and continuously to adapt to changing customer expectations and technology advancements. If we fail to execute our strategy or adapt as market conditions evolve, we may not meet customer expectations or compete effectively. Our entry into new markets presents additional risks, and we may face challenges in integrating acquired businesses. Our financial results fluctuate, making it difficult to predict future performance. We are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, and changes in tax laws could significantly impact our financial condition.

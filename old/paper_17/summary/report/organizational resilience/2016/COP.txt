Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We have taken actions early in the year to mitigate the impacts of possible prolonged weak prices, which included reducing our quarterly dividend, issuing long-term debt, obtaining a term loan, and reducing capital expenditures and production and operating expenses. We believe we have taken prudent actions to position the company for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility. Our capital allocation focuses on maintaining flat production volumes and paying our existing dividend, which reflects our commitment to operational flexibility and resilience. We have established clear priorities for allocating future cash flows, which include investing capital to maintain production and grow our existing dividend while reducing debt to maintain a strong investment-grade rating through price cycles. 

The energy landscape remains challenged, and we are regularly evaluated by major rating agencies based on our financial strength and conditions affecting the oil and gas industry. Our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults under our contracts with, third parties. The operation of our business requires us to engage in transactions with numerous counterparties, and any default may adversely affect our business or results of operations. Our ability to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital is crucial for our growth and resilience. 

We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and controlling costs, which is essential for sustaining our competitive position in a low commodity price environment. Our operational priorities include maintaining capital discipline and optimizing our portfolio by focusing on low-cost supply assets that strategically fit our development plans. We strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment, systematically managing risk to drive sustainable business growth. 

Our sustainability efforts focus on updating action plans for climate change and enhancing operational performance. We are dedicated to building a learning organization that employs human performance principles to improve health, safety, and environmental performance. Our exploration and production activities are subject to numerous laws and regulations, and we are committed to compliance while managing the associated risks. 

Our financial priorities include returning capital to shareholders and focusing on financial returns through disciplined capital allocation. We have shifted our capital allocation to value-preserving, shorter cycle time, and low-cost supply unconventional programs. We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor easily determinable, but we anticipate that they will continue to have an increasing impact on our operations. 

In summary, our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our resilience against external pressures while ensuring operational continuity and adaptability in a volatile business environment.

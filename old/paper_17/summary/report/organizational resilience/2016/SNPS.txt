The growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries, and our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical for maintaining operational continuity. The increasing complexity of designs and customers' concerns about managing costs could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity, impacting our organizational health and resilience. Demand for our products and services could decrease if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate may negatively impact our operating results and could lead to increased customer bargaining power or reduced spending on software and services. The continued uncertainty in the global economy may also negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, as customers may postpone decision-making and decrease spending. Our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and resilience in a rapidly evolving market characterized by technological advancements and changing customer requirements. We must successfully balance conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs to ensure our organizational effectiveness. Our growth strategy includes expanding our product portfolio and addressing customer needs, which requires operational flexibility and adaptability to changing market conditions. We also face risks related to acquisitions, including the integration of new technologies and the potential for operational disruptions. Our financial results are subject to fluctuations due to various factors, including changes in demand for our products and the timing of contract renewals. The global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. Cybersecurity threats pose additional risks, as breaches could compromise sensitive information and harm our reputation. We proactively manage our cash equivalents and short-term investments to ensure ample liquidity, which is crucial for navigating uncertainties and maintaining organizational resilience. Our success depends on protecting our proprietary technology and effectively managing legal and regulatory risks. We also rely on a global network of infrastructure applications and technology systems, and disruptions due to catastrophic events could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations. Our ability to attract and retain key employees is essential for driving future success, and competition for qualified personnel is intense. We must continue to adapt our strategies and practices to enhance our organizational resilience and ensure long-term sustainability in a turbulent market environment.

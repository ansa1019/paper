Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable. Our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and services is influenced by various factors, including the effectiveness of our sales organization and the level of demand for our products and services. We face risks associated with natural disasters, health emergencies, and geopolitical instability, which could disrupt our supply chain and impact our operational continuity. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and the economic health of our customers, and adverse economic conditions may lead to longer sales cycles and reduced unit sales. We rely significantly on revenue from our security subscription and technical support services, which may fluctuate due to changes in customer satisfaction and spending levels. Our inventory management is complex, and insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities, while excess inventory could harm our gross margins. We are also subject to risks related to international sales and operations, including economic or political instability in foreign markets and compliance with foreign laws and regulations. Our dependence on a limited number of key channel partners means that our billings, revenue, and operating results may be harmed by their inability to successfully sell our products or by their financial difficulties. We must continue to improve our systems, processes, and controls to manage future growth effectively, as any failure to do so could result in increased costs and harm our reputation and results of operations. The impact of the coronavirus outbreak on our business remains uncertain, and if it continues to spread, it could materially negatively impact our financial results. We must also manage our relationships with third-party manufacturers and logistics providers, as any disruptions could impair our ability to fulfill orders. Our future performance depends on the continued services of our senior management and our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, as competition for such talent is intense. We may face challenges in integrating acquired businesses and technologies, which could divert management's attention and resources. Our products must interoperate with those from other vendors, and any errors or defects could harm our reputation and market acceptance. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply could result in reputational damage and increased costs. The network security market is rapidly evolving, and we must accurately predict and respond to technological developments and changing customer needs to maintain our competitive position. Our ability to manage operational resources effectively, including financial resources and personnel, is critical to our success. We must also navigate the complexities of compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our business, as non-compliance could lead to significant penalties and operational disruptions.

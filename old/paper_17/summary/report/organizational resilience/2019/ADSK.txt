We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. Our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions. The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused additional uncertainty in the global economy, impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance and costs related to product defects. Rapid technological changes and changes in customer requirements characterize the software industry, requiring us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy. We are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to unexpected situations. Our executive management team must act quickly and continuously to meet rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements. We are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to support our customers and ensure operational continuity. However, should our investments not succeed, or if delays disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed. We rely on our network and data center infrastructure for our operational activities, and any catastrophic event could adversely impact our business and financial results. We have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potential impact of such events. Our dependency on international revenue exposes us to significant regulatory, economic, and political risks, which could adversely impact our financial results. The geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism may increase the volatility of global financial markets and impact our ability to conduct business effectively. We regularly acquire or invest in businesses and technologies that are complementary to our business, but these acquisitions entail risks, including the difficulty of assimilating solutions and operations. We are also exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results. Our ability to adapt our business model to meet customer requirements is critical, as failure to do so may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. We are committed to maintaining strong relationships with our distribution channels, as their financial stability is essential for generating revenue. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding our offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which are vital for enhancing our competitive advantage. We continuously monitor the health of our business through key performance metrics, including annualized recurring revenue and net revenue retention rate, to ensure we are well-positioned to respond to market demands and maintain organizational resilience. Our focus on innovation and customer needs is essential for thriving in a competitive landscape characterized by rapid change and uncertainty.

In deciding whether to invest in AIG, it is essential to consider various risk factors that could have a significant or material adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. These factors are interrelated and could emerge under similar business and economic conditions, potentially exacerbating their effects. The company’s businesses are highly dependent on global economic and market conditions, which can lead to poor operating environments, erosion of consumer and investor confidence, and declines in asset valuations. Adverse economic conditions may arise from geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and uncertainties surrounding trade disputes, which could materially affect AIG's operations and financial condition. The company regularly reviews the adequacy of established loss reserves, which may develop adversely and impact results. Estimation of ultimate net losses is complex, particularly for long-tail liability lines, and unexpected claims may increase the size or number of claims beyond underwriting intent. The company utilizes various analytical reserve development techniques to project future loss development, which is significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors. The potential inadequacy of liabilities established for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the general insurance companies, and there is significant uncertainty in factors that may drive the ultimate development of losses compared to estimates. The company actively monitors and manages its exposure to catastrophic events, which could adversely affect operational results. The management of catastrophe exposure includes setting risk limits based on aggregate probable maximum loss modeling, monitoring overall exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance. The company recognizes climate change implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk, adapting underwriting practices and product offerings accordingly. The company’s operational and organizational efficiency is enhanced through strategic initiatives, including ongoing investments in technology and process improvements. The management of operational risk is integral to maintaining organizational resilience, with a focus on identifying and mitigating risks associated with inadequate or failed internal processes. The company’s risk management framework incorporates a three lines of defense model, with business leaders accountable for risks and controls in their operating units. The enterprise risk management department supervises and integrates risk management functions, providing senior management with a consolidated view of major risk positions. AIG's investment strategies are tailored to business needs, targeting an asset allocation mix that provides diversification while generating investment income and preserving capital. The company actively manages liquidity risk to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet obligations, employing a comprehensive liquidity risk management framework that includes stress testing and monitoring of liquidity sources and uses. The company’s insurance operations are subject to various risks, including credit risk, market risk, and operational risk, which are managed through established governance structures and risk management frameworks.

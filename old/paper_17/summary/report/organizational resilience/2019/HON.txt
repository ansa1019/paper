Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to principal risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near- and long-term. We are committed to a strategy to become one of the world's leading software industrial companies, focusing on driving profitable growth through delivering innovative products and enhancing our footprint in high growth regions. We believe our ability to drive continuous earnings growth results from consistently identifying and investing in productivity initiatives. Our operational flexibility is critical to manage risks associated with macroeconomic and industry conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services. We have developed plans to mitigate potential impacts from global geopolitical instability and uncertainties arising from the evolving political, regulatory, and economic landscape. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers' inability to scale production during times of volatile demand, which could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts. The company is also subject to unique risks related to government contracts, including the right of the U.S. government to terminate contracts for convenience and conduct audits of our operations. Our operations are exposed to various risks, including environmental liabilities and cybersecurity incidents, which could disrupt business operations and adversely impact our reputation and results. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate cybersecurity threats, including continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems. A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets. We monitor disruptive technologies and business models to maintain our competitive advantage. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements and effectively manage our workforce. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect from our repositioning actions, and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. We are committed to maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of environmental disruptions and other external pressures. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational capabilities and fostering a learning organization. We recognize the importance of stakeholder engagement and collaboration networks in navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational success. The implications of these uncertainties could affect our business, financial position and results of operations, necessitating a proactive approach to risk management and strategic foresight.

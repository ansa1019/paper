Allstate manages these risks through an enterprise risk and return management framework on an integrated basis following our risk and return principles. The ability to maintain catastrophe reinsurance programs and limits is crucial for operational continuity, particularly in light of changing customer preferences and external pressures. The transformative growth plan is intended to accelerate profitable growth by expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing marketing and technology investments, and reducing operating expenses. Adjustments to our business structure, size, and underwriting practices in markets with significant severe weather and catastrophe risk exposure could adversely impact premium growth rates and retention. We continually refine our best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of the circumstances, which is essential for maintaining organizational health under challenging conditions. The enterprise risk appetite is cascaded into individual risk limits which set boundaries on the amount of risk we are willing to accept from one specific risk category before escalating for further management discussion and action. Our risk management strategies adapt to changes in business and market environments, ensuring operational flexibility and resilience strategies are in place to confront unexpected situations. The actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates are influenced by claims frequency and severity, which are critical for maintaining performance under pressure. The establishment of appropriate reserves requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate. We monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against the auto maintenance, repair, parts, and equipment price indices, which is vital for risk mitigation. The impact of strategic initiatives on enterprise risk is evaluated through the economic capital framework, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. Our catastrophe management strategy is designed to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business while providing protection to our customers. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted, and the estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophe losses comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and incurred but not reported claims. We utilize various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of environmental perturbations on our operations. The unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business due to the loss of their skills and knowledge. We depend heavily on computer systems and data to perform necessary business functions, and any failure in these systems could impair our ability to conduct business effectively. Our ability to adapt to technological advancements and innovations is critical for maintaining operational continuity and organizational resilience. The ongoing evaluation of investment management strategies is essential for ensuring financial resources are effectively deployed to support business continuity and strategic initiatives. The comprehensive review and interpretation of actuarial reports and trends are necessary for establishing reserves that reflect the current expectations of future claims.

The growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries, which have become increasingly complex ecosystems. Our customers frequently incorporate third-party intellectual property into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. We work closely with major foundries to ensure that our solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. If we fail to optimize our solutions, our products may become less desirable to our customers, adversely affecting our business and financial condition. The global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States, and our international operations subject us to various risks, including uncertain economic and political conditions, government trade restrictions, and inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions. Our business volume increases in the Asia Pacific region, which presents inherent risks that could result in trade disruptions. A significant trade disruption could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products, negatively impacting our future revenue and profits. We are also exposed to cybersecurity threats that could compromise sensitive information and harm our business and reputation. Our reliance on a global network of infrastructure applications and technology systems means that a disruption could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. We recognize that catastrophic events, including natural disasters and cybersecurity attacks, could disrupt our business and harm our operating results. Our financial results are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may impact our revenues and expenses. We face intense competition in our industries, and our ability to innovate and introduce new products is crucial for maintaining our competitive position. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, as competition for qualified personnel is intense. We have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees will not violate such laws. Our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets, and we may suffer losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value. We must manage our liquidity requirements carefully, as fluctuations in cash flows can impact our financial condition. Our operations are subject to evolving corporate governance regulations that increase compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance. We pursue new product and technology initiatives, and our ability to execute these initiatives successfully is critical to our business. We have made substantial investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements, but there is no guarantee that these investments will result in additional revenue. Our ability to manage risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments is essential for our growth strategy. The timing and value of contract renewals can lead to revenue fluctuations, and we must navigate the complexities of our customer relationships to maintain our market position.

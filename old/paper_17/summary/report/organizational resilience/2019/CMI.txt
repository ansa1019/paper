The markets we serve tend to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions, and economic downturns generally result in reduced sales of our products, which can impact our operational flexibility and competitive advantage. Our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards is essential for maintaining our competitive position in the engine markets we serve. We are conducting a formal internal review of our emissions certification process and compliance with emission standards, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to risks such as delays in product development and unanticipated technical difficulties. Our manufacturing and supply chain abilities may be adversely impacted by extended shutdowns, as experienced during the coronavirus outbreak, which highlights the need for effective crisis management and operational continuity strategies. We face significant competition in the markets we serve, and the increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing relationships and limit our ability to benefit from their growth. Our business is also exposed to potential product liability claims, which can divert management's attention and impact our reputation. The ongoing restructuring actions, including workforce reductions, are intended to respond to the deterioration in global markets and expected reductions in orders, which may not realize anticipated savings or benefits. We are investing in new technologies, including electrified powertrains and hydrogen generation, to adapt to changing market demands and regulatory environments. The development of these technologies is critical for our future resilience and ability to meet customer needs in a rapidly evolving business landscape. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, which require us to maintain compliance and adapt our practices to mitigate risks associated with potential noncompliance. Additionally, our reliance on a global supply chain exposes us to risks from political, economic, and regulatory matters, which necessitate a robust risk management framework to ensure business continuity. We recognize that the successful navigation of these challenges is integral to our organizational resilience, enabling us to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. The anticipated savings from restructuring actions are expected to enhance our operational effectiveness, but we must also remain vigilant in assessing the impact of external pressures and market volatility on our performance. Our strategic initiatives, including potential acquisitions and divestitures, aim to reposition our portfolio and improve shareholder value, although these actions carry inherent risks and uncertainties. The need for effective resource allocation and management is paramount in maintaining our organizational health and ensuring our ability to adapt to unforeseen circumstances.

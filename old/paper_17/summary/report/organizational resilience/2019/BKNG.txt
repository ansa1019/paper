The risks and uncertainties described in this annual report should be carefully considered, as they may impair our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Our financial results and prospects are almost entirely dependent upon the sale of travel services, which tend to decline during economic downturns or periods of political or economic uncertainty. Economic or political disruptions could negatively affect travel demand and our results of operations. Events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, health concerns, and geopolitical tensions, may disrupt travel and limit the willingness of travelers to visit certain locations, adversely affecting our business. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which can impact consumer travel behavior and complicate our ability to forecast industry trends. The uncertainty of macro-economic factors makes it difficult to manage our business effectively. We face risks related to the growth rate and global expansion of our business, which may slow due to various factors, including economic conditions and competitive pressures. Our strategy involves continued expansion worldwide, but compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions poses challenges. The complexity of our operations increases as we expand, which may strain our management and resources. We rely on performance and brand marketing channels to generate traffic to our platforms, and maintaining brand awareness is critical to attracting and retaining customers. We have invested significantly in marketing and technology to enhance our services and adapt to changing consumer demands. Our ability to innovate and improve our offerings is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. The markets for our services are intensely competitive and subject to rapid change, requiring us to adapt quickly to technological advancements and evolving consumer preferences. Our future success depends on our ability to manage these complexities and uncertainties while continuing to grow our business. We are also subject to various competition, anti-trust, consumer protection, and online commerce laws, which may increase compliance costs and affect our operations. The impact of seasonality on our business can lead to fluctuations in profitability, and we must navigate the challenges posed by changing market conditions and regulatory environments. Our reliance on third-party service providers and payment processors introduces additional risks, including potential disruptions to our operations. We have experienced significant growth in our accommodation reservation services, driven by our investments in marketing and technology, but we must remain vigilant in managing the associated risks and uncertainties. The ongoing evolution of the travel industry necessitates a proactive approach to risk management and strategic adaptation to ensure our long-term resilience and success.

Our business and operations are subject to many risks, including the volatility of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices, which can materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats, which could disrupt our operations and impact our organizational resilience. We rely extensively on information technology systems to process and analyze all stages of our business operations, and while we have implemented controls and protections to mitigate risks, these measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats. Our business continuity plans are designed to address significant disruptions, but there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding adverse impacts. The occurrence of security breaches could lead to operational disruptions, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential environmental hazards, all of which could materially affect our business. We maintain insurance against many risks, but the occurrence of uninsured events could reduce the funds available for our operations. The availability, proximity, and capacity of gathering, processing, compression, storage, and transportation facilities are critical to our operational flexibility and resilience. Our ability to maintain production levels and manage costs is contingent upon successfully acquiring or discovering additional reserves and effectively integrating acquired properties into our operations. The regulatory environment is subject to change, which could increase our compliance costs and affect our operational capabilities. We continuously monitor and assess proposed policies and regulations to determine their impact on our operations. Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the inability of customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations, which could limit our ability to sell production. The competitive landscape in the oil and gas industry is intense, and we may face challenges in accessing necessary services and resources, which could hinder our ability to adapt to market changes. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing our capital expenditures effectively to support our strategic initiatives and resilience strategies. Our management team plays a crucial role in executing our business strategy and addressing challenges, and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our organizational capabilities. We are also subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations, including political and economic instability, which could impact our ability to operate effectively in those regions. Overall, our ability to navigate these complexities and maintain operational continuity is essential for our long-term success and organizational resilience.

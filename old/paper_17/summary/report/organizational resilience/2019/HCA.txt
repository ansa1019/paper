Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, exposing us to interest rate risk and limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, which may force us to take actions that may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and factors beyond our control. We face significant risks during periods of economic weakness, including potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements and increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective procedures. Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our management and medical support personnel, and failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We depend on the quality and dedication of health care providers and other team members, and our ability to recruit and retain physicians is critical to our success. We routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and resilience. Our business strategy includes pursuing a disciplined development strategy and leveraging our scale to grow the company, which involves investing in initiatives that improve coordination of care and patient retention. We have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, but the potential emergence of a pandemic or public health crisis is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations. The health care industry is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals for patients has intensified, which may put pressure on our pricing and ability to contract with third-party payers. We are subject to numerous investigations by various government agencies, and the outcome of these inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our facilities are insured for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, and we maintain reserves for professional liability risks, which are essential for managing operational risks. We are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure. Our ability to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to meet our debt service obligations is critical, and adverse changes in the percentage of patients having adequate health care coverage could affect our cash flows and results of operations. We continue to face challenges related to the collection of patient due accounts, and adverse changes in economic conditions may increase budgetary pressures on states, potentially resulting in decreased spending for health care programs. Our overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness, and we anticipate that the federal deficit and the aging population will continue to place pressure on government health care programs. We are committed to providing high-quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business and creating long-term value for our stockholders, which requires a focus on resilience strategies and mechanisms to adapt to changing conditions.

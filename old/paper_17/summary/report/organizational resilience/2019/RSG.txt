This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed. General economic and market conditions, including inflation and changes in costs, can adversely affect our operational flexibility and ability to manage growth. Severe weather conditions, including those brought about by climate change, could impair our financial results by causing increased costs, loss of revenue, reduced operational efficiency, or disruptions to our operations. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical for maintaining our organizational health and operational continuity. We face competition that may limit our ability to secure solid waste volume for our landfills, and fluctuations in prices for recycled commodities can adversely affect our financial condition. Our capital-intensive nature may require us to obtain additional funding, impacting our resource allocation and operational management. We are also exposed to environmental liabilities that could result in substantial expenses, which necessitates effective risk management strategies. Our dependence on key personnel and large, long-term contracts poses challenges to our organizational resilience. The solid waste industry is characterized by significant competition, and our ability to adapt to changes in regulations and market demands is essential for sustaining our competitive advantage. Our operations are increasingly dependent on technology, and any failures in these systems could disrupt our operations. We must also comply with environmental regulations that may impose additional costs and liabilities, affecting our ability to conduct or grow our business. The introduction of new accounting rules and changes in laws could adversely impact our results of operations. Our growth strategy places significant demands on our financial, operational, and management resources, and we may be unable to effectively manage this growth. The loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our performance under pressure. We are subject to various legal proceedings that could result in material adverse consequences. Our financial strategy depends on maintaining investment-grade ratings on our debt, which is contingent upon several factors beyond our control. We are also involved in environmental remediation obligations that require significant financial resources and may change over time. Our organizational practices must be robust enough to foresee and confront unexpected situations, ensuring our resilience in the face of adversity. The ability to manage our growth effectively and execute our acquisition strategy is crucial for our long-term success. We must continuously assess our operational resources and capabilities to adapt to the evolving business environment and maintain our organizational effectiveness.

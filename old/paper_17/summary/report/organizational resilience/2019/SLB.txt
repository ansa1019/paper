The following discussion of risk factors contains important information for understanding our business, particularly in relation to the demand for our products and services, which is substantially dependent on customer expenditures. The recent downturn in the oil and gas industry has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Demand for our products is sensitive to customer views of future economic growth and oil prices, and declines in these areas can lead to project modifications, delays, and general business disruptions. Our operations in over 120 countries expose us to various risks, including political and economic uncertainty, which can affect our ability to maintain operational continuity and resilience. We are subject to complex laws and regulations that could adversely affect our financial condition and operational effectiveness. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities may reduce our earnings and cash available for operations, necessitating effective risk management and resource allocation strategies. We rely on contractual indemnities and insurance to mitigate potential liabilities, but our coverage may not be sufficient to protect against all risks, particularly in the event of catastrophic incidents. The competitive nature of the oilfield service industry requires us to maintain technology leadership to defend our competitive advantage. Our ability to adapt to market conditions and technological advancements is critical for sustaining performance under pressure and ensuring organizational resilience. As we navigate severe weather events and cyber threats, our reliance on information systems underscores the need for robust crisis management and event impact assessment strategies. The implementation of strategic initiatives, including the formation of joint ventures and divestitures, reflects our commitment to reconfiguring our operational framework to enhance resilience and adaptability. Our focus on high-grading our portfolio aims to promote margin expansion and improve returns, which is essential for organizational survival in a volatile market. The anticipated growth in international revenue, driven by increased activity and investment, highlights our strategic response to external pressures and the need for operational flexibility. Our ability to foresee and confront challenges, including environmental regulations and market fluctuations, is integral to our organizational health and long-term sustainability. The ongoing evaluation of our operational resources and financial strategies will be crucial in maintaining our competitive position and ensuring future success in a complex and dynamic business environment.

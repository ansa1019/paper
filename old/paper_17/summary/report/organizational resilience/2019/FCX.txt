This report contains forward-looking statements regarding our expectations related to productivity and innovation initiatives, which are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to external pressures. We caution that fluctuations in market prices of commodities we produce may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and affect our ability to repay debt, thereby impacting our organizational health. Extended declines in market prices could necessitate revisions to our operating plans, including curtailing production and reducing operating costs, which would affect our performance under pressure. Our financial results will vary with fluctuations in commodity prices, and geopolitical uncertainties could inhibit international trade and negatively impact business confidence, creating risks of constraints on our ability to trade in certain markets. 

We are engaged in numerous legal proceedings that may arise in the ordinary course of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain, and adverse developments can result in significant monetary damages or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. Our international operations are subject to political, economic, and social risks, which may adversely affect our business. We must maintain a good working relationship with governments in countries where we operate, as disruptions could impact our reputation and operations. 

Our mining operations are subject to operational risks, including natural disasters and equipment failures, which could materially and adversely affect our business. We face significant environmental, safety, and engineering challenges in managing waste rock and tailings, which are critical for maintaining our operational integrity. Our tailings management program is designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and we apply substantial resources to ensure structural stability and avoid catastrophic failures. 

We continue to advance initiatives to enhance productivity and reduce capital intensity through the utilization of new technology applications. These initiatives are expected to drive improved overall performance and are critical for our strategic response to market conditions. Our ability to adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain operational continuity is essential for achieving our major objectives. 

Our operations depend on the availability of secure water supplies, and competition for these resources is significant. We are actively participating in legal proceedings to secure our water rights, which are vital for our mining operations. The management of our resources, including financial and operational resources, is crucial for sustaining our business in the face of uncertainties and market volatility. 

The development of our underground mines and operations involves inherent risks, including geological conditions and potential delays, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition. Our ability to replenish mineral reserves is essential for long-term success, and exploration activities are highly speculative, requiring substantial capital expenditures. 

In summary, we are focused on maintaining resilience through strategic initiatives, operational flexibility, and effective risk management to navigate the complexities of the mining industry and external pressures.

We continue to expand the pursuit of our decision management strategy, which is designed to enable us to increase our business by selling multiple products to clients and developing custom client solutions, potentially leading to new proprietary products. Our strategy is increasingly focused on the delivery of our products through cloud-based deployments, which may enhance our operational flexibility and adaptability in response to market conditions. If we are unable to access new markets or develop new distribution channels, our growth prospects could suffer. Our growth and the success of our strategy depend upon our ability to develop and sell new products or suites of products, including cloud-based offerings. Significant undetected errors or delays in new products may affect market acceptance and harm our business. We have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products due to difficulties in acquiring data and adapting to client systems, which highlights the need for effective risk management and operational continuity. The businesses of our largest customers depend on favorable macroeconomic conditions, and if these customers are negatively impacted, our revenues could decline. The potential for economic disruption presents considerable risks to our business, including potential bankruptcies or credit deterioration of financial institutions with which we have substantial relationships. Our reliance on relationships with third parties for marketing and distribution could adversely affect our future revenues if we experience difficulties in these relationships. Our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business and involve increased expenses, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals contemplated at the time of a transaction. We have implemented a reengineering initiative designed to grow revenues through strategic resource allocation and improve profitability through cost reductions, although its long-term success is uncertain. The occurrence of negative events may cause fluctuations in our stock price, and we believe that period-to-period comparisons of financial results may not be indicative of future performance. Our ability to increase revenues will depend on introducing new products and services, and if the marketplace does not accept these offerings, our revenues may decline. We must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and satisfy customer requirements. Our future success will depend on our ability to innovate, anticipate and effectively respond to changing customer needs, and manage operational resources efficiently. We are also subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, and claims that may require significant judgment in assessing potential liabilities. Our success depends on our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect these could harm our competitive position. Cybersecurity breaches could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation, emphasizing the importance of robust crisis management and resilience strategies. Our business requires the storage, transmission, and utilization of sensitive consumer information, making protection from system interruptions critical. We continue to pursue opportunities outside the U.S., which presents additional risks that could negatively affect our operating results. Overall, our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and manage external pressures will be crucial for maintaining organizational resilience and achieving our strategic objectives.

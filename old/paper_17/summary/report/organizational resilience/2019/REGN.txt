We operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. We are substantially dependent on the success of Eylea, which represents a substantial portion of our revenues. The effectiveness of our commercial strategy, including pricing strategy and the ability to maintain sales in the face of competitive products, is critical for our operational flexibility. Our ability to meet the demand for commercial supplies of our marketed products and maintain regulatory compliance is essential for sustaining profitability. We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, and failure to maintain compliance could materially harm our business. The commercial success of our products is subject to significant competition, and we rely on collaborations with Bayer and Sanofi for commercialization efforts, which introduces additional risks. If we are unable to establish commercial capabilities outside the United States or if our collaborators fail to perform adequately, our ability to commercialize products will be adversely affected. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities, which are critical for our adaptability and future orientation. Our financial results may fluctuate based on various factors, including the net sales of our marketed products and the continuation of our collaborations. We have limited commercial capabilities outside the United States and would need to develop or outsource these capabilities, which could delay product launches. Our reliance on third-party collaborators and service providers for manufacturing and commercialization activities introduces risks that could impact our operational continuity. We are also dependent on key personnel, and our ability to attract and retain qualified staff is crucial for our organizational health. The complexity of our manufacturing processes and the need for compliance with stringent regulatory requirements present challenges that could affect our resilience. We recognize that our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance and regulatory requirements that could adversely affect our operations. Our financial condition is influenced by various factors, including the potential need for additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms. We must also manage our resources effectively to ensure operational flexibility and maintain performance under pressure. Our ability to foresee and confront challenges, including changes in the competitive landscape and regulatory environment, is essential for our organizational resilience. We continuously assess our risk management strategies and the implications of external pressures on our business continuity. The ongoing development of our product candidates and the commercialization of our marketed products are critical to our success and require substantial investment in research and development. We must navigate the complexities of our collaborations and maintain effective communication and coordination with our partners to achieve our strategic objectives.

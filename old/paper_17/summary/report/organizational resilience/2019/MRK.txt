The company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to conduct critical operations. Disruption, degradation, or manipulation of these IT systems through intentional or accidental means could adversely affect key business processes. The company has implemented a variety of measures to enhance and modernize its systems to guard against cyber-attacks and is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to enhance the company's resiliency against future cyber-attacks, including incidents similar to the 2017 attack. The objective of these efforts is to protect against future cyber-attacks and improve the speed of the company's recovery from such attacks, enabling continued business operations during any recovery period. The company seeks to maintain operational continuity and resilience through various strategic initiatives, including substantial investments in new capital projects focused on expanding manufacturing capacity across its key businesses. The company is also committed to enhancing its portfolio and pipeline with external innovation, which reinforces its science-led strategy. The company’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products, and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs poses a significant risk to its ability to replace sales of successful products that have lost patent protection. The company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and indications to cover substantial research and development costs and replace lost sales. The company is subject to various risks, including competition from generic products and pricing pressures, which could adversely affect its business operations and financial condition. The company has taken actions and made contingency plans for scenarios in which the UK and the EU do not reach a satisfactory trade agreement, which could materially impact its business operations. The company’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of its key products. Events that adversely affect the markets for its leading products could have a significant adverse impact on results of operations and cash flows. The company is also exposed to market risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could negatively affect its business and financial condition. The company’s success is dependent on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, as competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry is intense. The company has experienced difficulties in manufacturing certain products, which can lead to product shortages and reputational harm. The company’s research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing resources on candidates capable of delivering maximum value. The company evaluates potential growth opportunities that meet its strategic criteria, including acquisitions and collaborations, to enhance its resilience and adaptability in a competitive landscape.

Our business, operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to customer concentration, which increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by our significant customers. Dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations. A prolonged disruption at one or more of our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations. We must maintain appropriate capacity at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand for our proprietary products, and failure to do so could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to generate cash in the future will depend on our ability to manage our operational resources effectively and respond to changes in market conditions, which may be influenced by external pressures such as economic downturns or trade tensions. Our growth strategy includes the acquisition of businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies, which involves risks and uncertainties, including the need to effectively identify and manage the performance of acquired personnel and the potential for disruptions to our business. We are often involved in legal proceedings that can divert management's attention and result in significant expenses, which could adversely affect our organizational health and operational flexibility. Our success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, particularly in engineering and technical roles, as well as our ability to adapt to changing market dynamics and customer needs. The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses, which may adversely affect market acceptance and our reputation. We are subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, potentially impacting our operational continuity. Our business is also affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We recognize that our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform our operations is critical for maintaining performance under pressure. Our operational management strategies must include effective risk assessment and mitigation measures to ensure resilience in the face of unexpected situations. The industries in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards, necessitating ongoing investments in research and development to maintain competitive advantage and organizational agility. We face significant challenges in managing our supply chain and ensuring timely delivery of products, which are essential for meeting customer demands and sustaining business performance. Our financial health may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and changes in tax regulations, which could impact our strategic planning and resource allocation.

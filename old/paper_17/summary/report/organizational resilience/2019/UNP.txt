The following discussion addresses significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky, including the need to manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity. We may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations, including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives, rail cars, and other equipment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Our operational flexibility is critical, as significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network may lead to network difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity, compromising the level of service we provide to our customers. Despite efforts to improve our transportation plan and add capacity, we cannot be certain that these measures will fully address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity. We face competition from other transportation providers, and any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We rely on technology in all aspects of our business, and if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage. Cybersecurity risks are also a concern, as breaches or circumventions of our systems may result in significant service interruptions, operational difficulties, and financial losses. We are subject to significant governmental regulation, and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Climate change and severe weather conditions may result in significant business interruptions and expenditures, adversely affecting our operational efficiency. Our capital plan is a critical component of our long-term strategic plan, which aims to enhance the long-term value of the company by providing sufficient resources to replace and improve existing track infrastructure, increase network efficiency, and make investments that meet customer demand. We expect to continue utilizing a multi-faceted approach to safety and risk assessment, which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. The implementation of unified plan 2020 is designed to increase reliability of our service product, reduce variability in network operations, and improve resource utilization. We must remain agile and responsive to our customers' needs, and our ongoing productivity initiatives are expected to drive margin improvement. Our access to liquidity through capital markets is dependent on our financial stability, and deterioration of our operating results could negatively impact our ability to access these markets. We have identified various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures, and we are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may affect our financial condition. The ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes is essential for our organizational resilience, which reflects our capacity to maintain performance under pressure and adapt to complex situations. We continue to take steps to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment and enhance our operational capabilities through strategic investments and technological advancements.

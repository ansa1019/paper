An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. The grounding of the 737 max fleet has created significant uncertainty and adversely impacted our operations. We are focused on safely returning the 737 max to service, which involves developing software updates and associated pilot training programs. The suspension of production and the gradual resumption of production at low production rates will result in abnormal production costs that will be expensed when incurred. We have made significant assumptions regarding the timing and conditions of return to service, which are highly uncertain and significantly affect our financial estimates. Any delays in regulatory approval, the resumption of deliveries, or disruptions to our production system could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Our ability to deliver aircraft on time and satisfy regulatory and customer requirements is subject to significant risks, and we must minimize disruption caused by production changes to maintain profitability. The commercial aircraft market is highly competitive, and we face pressures from international competitors, which necessitates operational flexibility and strategic adaptation. The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and certification schedules. We are also subject to unique risks associated with government contracts, including compliance costs and the potential for contract modifications or terminations. Our commercial airplanes business depends on maintaining a healthy production system and achieving planned production rate targets. The complexity of our commercial aircraft production system means that operational challenges can result in production delays and failure to meet customer demand, negatively impacting revenues and operating margins. We rely on an extensive network of suppliers and subcontractors, and any service disruption from these suppliers could materially affect our ability to meet commitments to customers. Our financial performance is also influenced by external factors such as market conditions, customer financing availability, and geopolitical developments. We are exposed to various risks, including environmental liabilities and cybersecurity threats, which could impact our operations and reputation. The ongoing uncertainty with respect to U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment requires us to adjust successfully to changing acquisition policies to maintain our market share. Our strategic initiatives focus on leveraging core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets. We are committed to improving efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders, and we continue to seek opportunities to reduce costs and optimize resource management. The long-term nature of many of our contracts makes the estimation of costs and revenues inherently risky, and changes in underlying assumptions could materially affect financial performance. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical to our organizational resilience, particularly in the face of external pressures and operational challenges.

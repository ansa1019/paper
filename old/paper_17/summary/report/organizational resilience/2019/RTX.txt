Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be impacted by global economic, capital market, and political conditions, which may affect our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to external pressures. Economic conditions such as tightening credit in financial markets could adversely affect our customers' and suppliers' ability to obtain financing, potentially leading to decreased orders and impacting our performance. The cyclical nature of the commercial aviation and defense industries ties our financial performance directly to economic conditions, which may vary significantly due to factors such as geopolitical risks, regulatory changes, and fluctuations in consumer confidence. Our reliance on suppliers exposes us to risks related to disruptions, capacity constraints, and price increases, which could hinder our operational flexibility and ability to meet commitments. The anticipated separation transactions into independent companies may present challenges that could affect our organizational health, including the diversion of management's attention and the need to retain key employees and operational relationships. Additionally, the complexity of these transactions may lead to unforeseen costs and operational disruptions that could impair our competitive position. We are also subject to risks associated with international operations, including changes in local government regulations and economic instability, which may impact our ability to respond effectively to market demands. Our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and divestitures, require careful management to realize expected benefits and mitigate risks associated with integration and operational alignment. Cybersecurity threats present evolving challenges that could disrupt our information technology infrastructure and business operations, necessitating robust risk management strategies to safeguard our systems and maintain resilience. Furthermore, our ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions is critical for sustaining competitive advantage, particularly in the face of technological advancements and shifting customer needs. The potential for adverse legal and compliance risks underscores the importance of maintaining organizational coherence and effective governance structures to navigate complex regulatory environments. Overall, our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning amidst adversity is contingent upon effective resource allocation, strategic foresight, and the ability to leverage internal knowledge and external collaborations to enhance resilience and ensure long-term sustainability.

The commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that customers' planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, and customers' profitability, which are affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions. The airline industry has historically been severely affected by downturns in the global economy, higher fuel prices, and increased security concerns, which could impact future profitability. During periods of reduced airline profitability, airlines may delay purchases of spare parts, impacting demand for certain products. A material reduction in purchasing by larger customers could adversely affect net sales, gross margin, and net income. The company relies heavily on certain customers, with a significant portion of sales coming from a limited number of customers, which increases vulnerability to changes in demand. The company does not generally have guaranteed future sales, and fixed-price contracts carry risks for cost overruns. The military and defense market is dependent on government budget trends, and a significant decline in U.S. military expenditures could reduce sales. The company intends to pursue acquisitions to create value, but integration of acquired operations poses risks, including unforeseen costs and management attention that could detract from servicing customers and developing new products. The successful integration of new businesses depends on the ability to manage these operations effectively. The company is subject to unique business risks in supplying equipment and services to the U.S. government, including potential contract termination and audits that could distract from effective management. The aerospace industry is highly regulated, and compliance with government regulations is essential to avoid penalties that could adversely affect business. The company’s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, which may require investigation and remediation of contamination, potentially impacting financial results. The company depends on a skilled workforce, and competition for personnel could adversely affect business operations. Any work stoppage could materially impact the ability to provide products to customers. The company is also exposed to litigation and regulatory proceedings that may adversely affect financial performance. The availability of components and raw materials from suppliers is critical, and disruptions could adversely impact operations. Manufacturing facilities are subject to physical risks that could disrupt production, including natural disasters and cyber-attacks. The company’s operations depend on the ability to generate cash flow to meet debt obligations, which is subject to various external factors. The company has a significant amount of indebtedness, and an increase in debt could increase vulnerability to economic downturns and limit flexibility in responding to changes in the business environment. The company’s ability to make payments on and refinance its indebtedness will depend on future cash generation, which is subject to general economic and competitive factors. The company’s debt leverage ratio has varied widely, and maintaining compliance with covenants is critical to avoid defaults that could adversely affect operations. The company’s strategy includes obtaining profitable new business, improving cost structures, and providing highly engineered products, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and resilience in the face of market challenges.

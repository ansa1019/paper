The organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical for maintaining operational continuity. Business disruptions could have a material adverse effect on operations, damage reputation, and impact client relationships. The ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by disruptions in infrastructure, which could be caused by human error, natural disasters, or acts of terrorism. Our disaster recovery procedures may not be effective, and insurance may not continue to be available at reasonable prices. The failure of an underwriting enterprise with which we place business could result in errors and omissions claims against us by clients. Economic conditions that result in financial difficulties for underwriting enterprises could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition. We have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from underwriting enterprises, and if those companies experience liquidity problems, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us. Our operations outside the U.S. expose us to risks that may disrupt operations, including geopolitical or economic conditions. Maintaining awareness of and complying with a variety of labor practices and foreign laws is essential for operational effectiveness. We depend on key third-party vendors to provide technology and other support for strategic initiatives, and if these third parties fail to perform, our ability to execute on strategic initiatives could be adversely affected. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit may continue to result in substantial volatility in foreign exchange markets, which could impact financial results. The organization must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat and opportunity presented by digital disruption and developments in technology. Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based on flat fees rather than variable commission rates. The competitive landscape is characterized by significant pressures, including the need to adapt to legislative or industry developments that could adversely affect operations. We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position are the quality of services rendered and our ability to help clients manage their overall insurance costs. Our acquisition program is an important part of historical growth, and failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions could result in slower growth. We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses, and consolidation among competitors could create additional competitive pressure. The ability to attract and retain experienced talent is crucial, and competition for talent in rapidly developing fields is particularly intense. Our reputation is one of our key assets, and negative perceptions regarding our level of service or business practices could damage our reputation. We maintain policies and procedures designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential information, but we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or malfeasance. The organization’s future success depends on its ability to adapt to changes in the legal and regulatory landscape, particularly in relation to employer-sponsored healthcare. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is essential for organizational resilience.

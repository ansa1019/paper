This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the classification, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and sale of our products, which can be costly and time-consuming. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions that could adversely affect our operational continuity and organizational effectiveness. Our global operations are subject to risks and potential costs, including changes in reimbursement, changes in regulatory requirements, and political and economic instability, which could impact our ability to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We may experience loss of market share, additional expense, and harm to our reputation due to interruptions in manufacturing operations, which could adversely affect our business. We rely on indirect distribution channels that may be at risk if they choose to sell competitive products or are subject to new regulations. Our ability to maintain close working relationships with healthcare professionals is critical for product development and market success; if we are unable to maintain these relationships, it could adversely affect our organizational resilience and strategic initiatives. Our reliance on certain suppliers exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated price increases, which could require significant capital expenditures and adversely impact our competitive position. We are in the process of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and any disruptions or deficiencies in this implementation could adversely affect our ability to operate effectively. We may be adversely affected by product liability claims and unfavorable court decisions, which could impact our financial position and operational capabilities. Our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. The ultimate cost to resolve legal matters, including product recalls, may be materially different than current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities based on the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, which reflects our organizational capability to manage complex regulatory environments. Our assessment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment and may be impacted by changes in market or macroeconomic conditions, which could affect our organizational strength and resilience. We are subject to various ongoing legal actions and claims that could result in significant liabilities, impacting our operational flexibility and overall performance.

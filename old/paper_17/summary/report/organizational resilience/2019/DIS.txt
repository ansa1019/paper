For an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. Changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. A decline in economic activity can adversely affect demand, thus reducing revenue and earnings. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create entertainment offerings that meet changing preferences and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices. We must often invest substantial amounts in film production and other content before knowing the extent to which these products will earn consumer acceptance. If our offerings do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue may decline or fail to grow as anticipated, adversely affecting profitability. Changes in technology and consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our products and the revenue we can generate. The media entertainment and internet businesses increasingly depend on our ability to adapt to shifting patterns of content consumption through the adoption of new technologies. We regularly consider and implement changes to our business models to respond to these developments. The success of our businesses is highly dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights, and unauthorized use of our intellectual property may increase costs or reduce revenues. A variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of providing them. Demand for our products, particularly theme parks, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, which can be adversely affected by various factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions and health concerns. An incident affecting our property could have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and may discourage consumers from attending our facilities. We obtain insurance against the risk of losses relating to some of these events, but we may experience material losses not covered by our insurance. Changes in our business strategy or restructuring may increase costs or affect profitability. Increased competitive pressures may reduce revenues or increase costs, and we face substantial competition in each of our businesses. Our ability to renew long-term contracts for programming and distribution may be affected by market conditions and competition. Changes in regulations applicable to our businesses may impair profitability, and our operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by local laws. Damage to our reputation or brands may negatively impact our business across segments and regions. We may not successfully execute our direct-to-consumer strategy, and various risks may impact the profitability of our businesses. Turmoil in financial markets could increase borrowing costs and impede access to financing. Labor disputes may disrupt operations, and seasonality could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations. Sustained increases in costs of employee benefits may reduce profitability. The alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our borrowing costs. The integration of TFCF may present challenges that could impact our ability to realize anticipated benefits. The pursuit of the TFCF acquisition has placed a significant burden on our management and internal resources, which may disrupt ongoing business. The risks of operating internationally have increased, and the integration may result in additional costs and expenses. Our financial flexibility may be constrained by increased indebtedness following the TFCF acquisition, which could reduce funds available for capital expenditures and create competitive disadvantages.

We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services, and enhance our existing products and services. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner, or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our offerings. We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services, including the launch of the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service, which offers automation based on machine learning. However, if these innovations fail to operate as anticipated, our business and reputation may be harmed. Our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames or if there is a delay in market acceptance of new, enhanced, or acquired product lines or services. Our Oracle Cloud strategy may adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues, or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. We experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements. We have also acquired a number of cloud computing companies, and the integration of these companies into our Oracle Cloud strategy may not be as efficient or scalable as anticipated. Errors in our cloud, license, and hardware offerings can impact their function, performance, and security, which may adversely affect market acceptance and expose us to product liability claims. Our security measures for our products and services are critical to maintaining customer trust and operational continuity. We are subject to various legal proceedings, and litigation can be lengthy, expensive, and disruptive to our operations. Our international operations expose us to additional risks, including compliance with international laws and regulations, which can increase our cost of doing business. We continually evaluate our compensation practices to attract and retain qualified employees, as changes in labor laws may impact our access to talent. Our selective and active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy, but we may face difficulties in managing acquired companies and integrating their technologies. We must also navigate the complexities of foreign currency fluctuations, which can adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Our restructuring efforts to improve our cost structure may lead to temporary disruptions and reduced productivity. Overall, our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is contingent upon our strategic initiatives, operational flexibility, and adaptability to external pressures and market demands.

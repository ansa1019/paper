The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, which have historically adversely affected our revenue, cash flows, profitability, and growth. These external pressures and market uncertainties necessitate a strategic response to maintain operational flexibility and ensure business continuity. Our revenues, operating results, and profitability depend significantly upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas, which are subject to fluctuations driven by various factors beyond our control. Concerns over global economic conditions and geopolitical issues may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The ability to adapt to these environmental perturbations is critical for maintaining organizational health and performance under pressure. 

We have implemented strategies to mitigate risks associated with operational management and to enhance our resilience against disruptive events. Our development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves. We are focused on low-cost operations and best-in-class execution, seeking to control well costs while navigating industry challenges. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves and potential environmental liabilities, which are inherently uncertain and complex. 

Our operational success depends on finding, developing, or acquiring additional reserves that are economically recoverable, and we continuously evaluate the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives. The concentration of our producing properties in the Permian Basin exposes us to risks associated with regional supply and demand factors, which could impact our results of operations. We rely on several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production, and the loss of one or more of these purchasers could limit our access to suitable markets. 

Our ability to manage growth effectively is essential to our financial condition and results of operations. We have experienced significant growth since our initial public offering, which has placed additional demands on our resources. The failure to upgrade our operational and financial control systems or to recruit and retain experienced personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan. Our operations are also subject to various governmental laws and regulations, which can impose additional costs and operational constraints. 

In response to potential fluctuations in service costs, we have sought to lock in pricing for dedicated activity levels. Our capital expenditures are planned to cover potential increases in service costs, and we remain focused on improving our cost structure while increasing environmental transparency. The successful execution of our drilling program is contingent upon our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and to maintain operational continuity amidst external disturbances.

In evaluating risks, it is essential to consider that our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new or enhance existing products, services, and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business, including customer service and support. Our operations could be disrupted by various factors, including natural disasters, cyber-attacks, and other catastrophic events, which could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue, and an increase in costs and expenses. The occurrence of business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The ultimate impact on our operations from being located near major earthquake faults and concentrated in certain geographic locations is unknown. Additionally, geopolitical changes or changes in government regulations may result in economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies and profitability. We depend on third parties for manufacturing, assembly, testing, and packaging, which reduces our control over product quality and delivery schedules. This reliance on third parties may expose us to risks that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our business operations. We also face risks related to competition in our target markets, which could prevent us from growing our revenue. If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets or identify new products and technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted. Furthermore, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security features to defend against security threats, which may result in increased expenses. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to executing our business strategy effectively. The market for highly skilled workers is extremely competitive, and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Our operations are also subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business. The global nature of our business subjects us to various risks, including international economic and political conditions, unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, and disruptions of capital and trading markets. Our ability to respond effectively to these challenges and adapt to changing market conditions is crucial for maintaining organizational resilience and ensuring long-term success.

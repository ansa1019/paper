An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect BD's business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. A downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect operations, and deterioration in the domestic or international economic environment may cause decreased demand for products and services, resulting in lower sales volume and prices. The medical technology industry is very competitive, with significant competition from a wide range of companies, including large medical device companies and non-traditional entrants such as technology companies. The ability to compete is impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements, including increased demand for environmentally-friendly products and products incorporating digital capabilities. Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector may also result in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs and improve clinical results. The development of new or improved products by other companies may render BD's products obsolete or less competitive. The medical technology industry has experienced significant consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than BD, which intensifies competition among suppliers. Foreign currency exchange risk is a factor, as a substantial amount of revenues are derived from international operations, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect reported revenues. Changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers or other cost containment measures could affect demand for products and prices. The company faces risks related to the interruption of manufacturing or sterilization operations, which could adversely affect business. Interruption due to weather, natural disasters, or regulatory requirements could impact the ability to manufacture products. The company is subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with applicable laws could result in delays or prevent production and marketing of products. Cyber-attacks pose a risk to information technology systems, which could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information and disrupt operations. The ability to attract and retain key employees is critical for competitiveness, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. The success of strategic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Bard, may be affected by the ability to integrate operations and realize anticipated benefits. The companyâ€™s growth strategy depends on the ability to expand core business, develop innovative products, and improve organizational effectiveness. Macroeconomic challenges in Europe and pricing pressure globally could adversely impact business. The company continues to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product market programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. The ability to sustain long-term growth will depend on various factors, including the ability to adapt to changing market demands and manage operational resources effectively. The company's financial position remains strong, with significant cash flows from operating activities, but it must navigate various external pressures and uncertainties that could impact performance and resilience.

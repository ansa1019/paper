Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace.

The retail business continues to rapidly evolve, and our strategy includes investments in ecommerce, technology, and customer initiatives to maintain or grow our overall market position. Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geopolitical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, the closure of stores, and disruptions in the supply of products, which could adversely affect our operations. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, and any disruptions in our supply chain could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our reliance on information systems to process transactions and manage our business means that disruptions could harm our ability to conduct operations. Cyber threats and security breaches pose risks to our information systems, and any compromise could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs, and we continuously review our operational strategies to adapt to changing market conditions.

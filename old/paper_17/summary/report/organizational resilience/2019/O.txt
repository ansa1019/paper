This "risk factors" section contains references to competitive pressures that may affect our ability to attract new tenants and maintain cash flow from operations. Negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants could inhibit growth and impact our ability to lease space on favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as lack of demand, inability to retain tenants, oversupply of space, and declines in tenants' creditworthiness. Tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and any defaults or failures to pay rent could result in material losses. Our ability to generate cash flow from operations and make distributions to stockholders is dependent on our ability to manage these risks effectively. We are subject to unknown environmental liabilities that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The presence of hazardous substances on a property may impede our ability to lease or sell that property and may incur substantial remediation costs. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may require significant capital expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations. We depend on key personnel, and the loss of executive officers could materially affect our operations. Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or other unexpected events may interrupt our business operations and negatively affect our financial condition. Climate change could trigger extreme weather and changes that may result in physical damage to our properties and may adversely affect our financial condition. We seek to promote effective energy efficiency and sustainability strategies, but failure to comply with laws related to climate change could damage our reputation and incur fines. We rely on information technology networks for various business processes, and any failure or security breach could harm our business. Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms, impacting our ability to make acquisitions or sell properties. Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition, as increases in operating expenses could exceed revenue increases. Our internal controls may not prevent financial misstatements or loss of assets, which could result in decreased investor confidence and impair our access to capital. We are subject to risks related to recent proposals for reform regarding LIBOR, which could adversely impact our financial condition. Our business could be negatively affected by actions of activist stockholders, which could disrupt operations and divert management's attention from executing our business plan. The expiration of governmental tax incentives may adversely affect the value of our investments, cash flow, and net income. We continually monitor commercial real estate and global credit markets and may adjust our business strategy accordingly to mitigate risks associated with these factors.

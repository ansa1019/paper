In an effort to keep our stockholders and the public informed about our business, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our operational and financial performance, including our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations. Our future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully, which requires effective management of our operational, financial, and human resources. We may face risks in pursuing our strategy, including the potential inability to hire or retain necessary personnel and the challenges of maintaining cost savings achieved through optimization efforts. The implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, and general economic conditions. Our ability to make strategic acquisitions depends on our capacity to identify desirable targets and negotiate advantageous transactions, which may not yield the expected benefits due to difficulties in operating in new markets or providing new service offerings. We continue to seek to divest underperforming and non-strategic assets if we cannot improve their profitability, which could result in asset impairments or the continued operation of low-margin businesses. We have made significant investments in technology to innovate our operations and improve customer experience, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a highly fragmented industry. Our operations are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, and compliance with existing regulations can restrict or change our operations, increase our costs, or require additional capital expenditures. The regulatory environment is influenced by changes in leadership and policies, which can significantly impact our operations and financial condition. Our business is directly affected by changes in economic factors, including consumer confidence and access to capital markets, which can lead to decreased consumer spending and reduced volumes of waste generated. We have established protocols to address climate change risks, including severe storm events and other environmental perturbations that could negatively impact our operating results. Our operations rely on digital technology, and any failures in our information technology systems could disrupt our business. We are also subject to cybersecurity risks, which could result in business disruption and financial loss. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection is rapidly evolving, and any inability to comply with applicable laws could subject us to regulatory enforcement and damage our reputation. Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand, which are powerful sales and marketing tools. Adverse publicity could tarnish our reputation and reduce demand for our services. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, liquidity, and capital resources to plan for present needs and fund unbudgeted business activities that may arise due to changing conditions. Our strategic focuses on investing in people, technology, and growth are expected to drive continued growth in the future.

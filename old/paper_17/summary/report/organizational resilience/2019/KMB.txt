Our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. These risks include increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, intense competition, and changes in consumer purchasing patterns. Our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. We operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets, and our competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, enabling them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. Our strategy includes operations growth outside the U.S., especially in developing markets, and we are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and political, social, and economic instability. Our international operations may be adversely affected by these risks, which could impact our financial results. Disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, as our ability to manufacture, distribute, and sell products is critical. These activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires, labor strikes, and pandemics, which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. We have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events; however, if they occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations. Our information technology systems serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business, and any interruptions, failures, or breaches could disrupt our operations and lead to financial and reputational damage. We maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively. Our ongoing efforts to reduce costs and improve our competitive position through restructuring programs may enhance our resilience, but any negative impact on our relationships with employees, suppliers, or customers could adversely affect our financial results. The 2018 global restructuring program aims to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization, which is expected to yield significant cost savings. We continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, payments for our restructuring program, capital spending, and other needs for the foreseeable future. We do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall business, liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.

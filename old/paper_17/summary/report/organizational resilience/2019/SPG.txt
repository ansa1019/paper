The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made in this annual report. Conditions that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect us. Our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we could be materially and adversely affected by conditions that materially and adversely affect the retail environment generally, including fluctuations in seasonal spending, consumer perceptions of the safety and attractiveness of our properties, and the creditworthiness of our retail tenants. The increasing use of the internet by retailers and consumers impacts our retail tenants and demand for retail space at our properties. We may experience difficulty and delay in re-tenanting space, as well as in leasing spaces adjacent to vacant stores, which could lead to decreased customer traffic and sales. Bankruptcy filings by retailers can occur regularly, and if a tenant files for bankruptcy, the tenant may reject and terminate leases, which could materially and adversely affect us. We continually seek to re-lease vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations, and future tenant bankruptcies may strain our resources and impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy. We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably, including competition from e-commerce and other retail formats. The increased popularity of digital technologies has accelerated the transition of market share from physical stores to web-based shopping. Our international activities may subject us to risks that are different from or greater than those associated with our domestic operations, including adverse effects of changes in exchange rates and challenges of complying with foreign laws. We may not be successful in pursuing acquisition, development, or redevelopment opportunities, and newly acquired or developed properties may not perform as expected. Our ability to sell properties in response to changes in economic conditions may be limited due to the illiquidity of real estate investments. We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations, and our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to meet required debt service. Disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our ability to access external financing for growth and ongoing debt service requirements. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and the loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business. We face risks associated with security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. Our properties are subject to risks associated with climate change, including changes in weather patterns and the potential for natural disasters, which could adversely impact operations and increase investment costs. We may also face liabilities for environmental contamination and regulatory action in connection with environmental laws. Our ability to maintain our status as a REIT depends on our compliance with various requirements, and failure to comply could result in adverse tax consequences. We expect to generate positive cash flow from operations and consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash, which are principally derived from rents paid by our tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows could cause us to seek additional sources of financing or curtail planned capital expenditures.

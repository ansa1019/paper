The company's strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to mitigate the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. The company posted record backlog, orders, sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating cash flow, which reflects its ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The company has completed 18 acquisitions since the beginning of 2015, and it plans to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance its global market position and broaden its product offerings, which are essential for operational flexibility and resilience. The process of integrating acquired businesses into existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. The company’s growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions, and its ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will depend on factors such as identifying acceptable acquisition candidates and successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological, and operational processes. The company's operational excellence initiatives are designed to make the company more efficient, which is necessary in highly competitive industries, and a failure to implement them properly may adversely affect its business and operations. The company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities, and access to long-term capital funds to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the company’s commitment to research, development, and engineering activities to design and develop new and improved products and solutions is crucial for maintaining its competitive advantage and adaptability in a rapidly changing market environment. The company’s operational management and strategic initiatives under its four key strategies—operational excellence, strategic acquisitions, global and market expansion, and new products—are expected to have a positive impact on future results. The company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is indicative of its organizational resilience. The company’s reliance on information technology systems to manage critical business processes and activities underscores the importance of maintaining system integrity and operational continuity. The company’s financial flexibility, including its revolving credit facility, provides additional support for its growth plans, including its acquisition strategy, which is vital for sustaining performance under pressure and ensuring organizational survival in turbulent markets. The company’s focus on maintaining strong relationships with suppliers and customers, alongside its emphasis on compliance with various regulations, demonstrates its commitment to organizational health and resilience.

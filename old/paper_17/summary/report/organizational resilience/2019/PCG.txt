The companies concluded that the design of the companies' incentive pay plans has, overall, a low-risk profile from the perspective of encouraging employees to take material risks that have potentially adverse consequences to the organization. The emphasis on safety metrics supports an organization-wide focus on safety in its compensation plans, which was further enhanced in the 2020 executive compensation redesign that is awaiting approval by the bankruptcy court. The committee believes that the redesigned short- and long-term performance-based compensation programs not only meet but exceed the mandates of AB 1054 by prioritizing public safety and customer welfare, without sacrificing financial stability. The 2020 executive compensation programs balance key safety, customer welfare, and financial issues facing the companies with the need to continue to recruit and retain qualified executives to guide the companies through a period of uncertainty, including the unpredictability of the stock price. The committee also generally considered other compensation policies, such as clawback and anti-hedging policies, and vesting provisions. The safety component was structured to provide a strong focus on the safety of employees, customers, and communities. The measures used for performance evaluation included indices tracking safety and reliability, which reflect the organizationâ€™s ability to maintain operational effectiveness under challenging conditions. The overall performance score is the sum of the weighted cumulative average scores for performance on each of the measures, indicating a multifaceted approach to performance assessment that aligns with organizational resilience. The committee retains complete discretion to determine and pay all stip awards to neos and other eligible employees, including discretion to reduce the final score on any and all measures downward to zero. The restructuring and transformation process has necessitated a strong focus on safety and operational continuity, which are critical to the companies' resilience strategies. The emphasis on safety and operational incentive measures reflects the companies' commitment to maintaining organizational health and effectiveness amidst external pressures and disruptive events. The companies' approach to performance-based compensation is designed to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders, particularly in navigating the complexities of the chapter 11 restructuring process. The performance measures for the stip include safety, customer satisfaction, and financial components, which are essential for ensuring the companies' adaptability and operational flexibility in response to environmental perturbations. The committee's conclusion regarding the low-risk profile of the incentive pay plans underscores the importance of strategic initiatives that foster resilience and recovery in the face of adversity. The overall compensation structure is aimed at enhancing organizational capabilities and ensuring that the companies can effectively confront and manage unexpected situations while maintaining performance under pressure.

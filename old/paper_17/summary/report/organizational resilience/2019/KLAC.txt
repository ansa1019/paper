Ongoing changes in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, expose our business to significant risks, including the uncertainty of future growth rates, pricing trends, and changes in capital spending patterns. If we fail to appropriately adjust our cost structure and operations to adapt to these trends or timely develop new technologies, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry requires us to respond effectively to industry cycles; failure to do so could seriously harm our business. Our ability to recognize revenue may be negatively impacted by customers' funding status, which could be weakened by adverse business conditions. We must be in a position to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions, and any failure to respond could result in significant operational challenges. Our management provides quarterly forecasts based on business and operational forecasts, which can vary due to unexpected changes in customer orders or product shipments. The impact of delays or cancellations of customer orders may lead to lower revenues and significant inventory write-offs. We are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base, which increases our volatility tied to individual customers. Changes in ownership or management of our customers may result in complexities in managing relationships and transactions. Our business model is also affected by the need to develop and introduce new products and technologies in response to changing market conditions. Our competitive advantage depends on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop solutions that address changing customer needs. We must continue to invest significantly in research and development to enhance our products and maintain competitiveness. Disruptions to our manufacturing facilities or operations due to natural disasters, health epidemics, or terrorism could result in cancellation of orders and delays in deliveries. We have consolidated several operating facilities, which may concentrate risks related to disruptive events. Our operations are also subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations, and any failure to comply may subject us to significant consequences. We depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively, and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success. We outsource several services, which decreases our control over performance and may introduce operational difficulties. Cybersecurity threats pose significant risks to our operations, as we collect and store sensitive data. Our reliance on critical information systems for daily operations means that any inability to access these systems could adversely impact our business. We are also exposed to risks related to acquisitions and strategic alliances, which may not yield the expected benefits and could adversely affect our financial results. The increasing complexity of our supply chain and reliance on third-party suppliers heightens our risk exposure. Our liquidity may be affected by various factors, including economic conditions and capital expenditures. We believe that cash generated from operations, along with our existing cash reserves and credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements.

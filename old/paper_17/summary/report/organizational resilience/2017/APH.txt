The company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business and competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service, and delivery time.

The company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions. The company may experience difficulties and unanticipated expenses in connection with purchasing and integrating newly acquired businesses, which could impact its operational flexibility and performance.

The company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, and funding of pension obligations. The company’s ability to adapt to changes in market conditions, maintain operational continuity, and respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical to its organizational resilience and long-term success.

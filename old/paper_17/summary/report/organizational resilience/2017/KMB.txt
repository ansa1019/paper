Our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control, which could adversely affect our financial results and operational continuity. Intense competition, changes in consumer purchasing patterns, and the inability to innovate or market effectively highlight the need for operational flexibility and resilience. We operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets, where the actions of competitors could adversely affect our financial results. Our ability to develop new products is contingent upon successfully anticipating consumer needs and preferences, which requires internal knowledge and innovation. The introduction of new consumer products necessitates substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition, and ongoing support is essential for maintaining market position. 

We are increasingly dependent on key retailers, which may exert significant bargaining power, potentially leading to reduced profitability. The consolidation of retail trade and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business, necessitating strategic initiatives to adapt to these changes. Our ongoing efforts to reduce costs through restructuring programs aim to improve our competitive position, although any negative impact on relationships with employees, suppliers, or customers could adversely affect our financial results. 

Our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and political instability, which could impair our ability to operate effectively. Disruptions in our supply chain or failures of third-party providers could also impact our operations, highlighting the importance of crisis management and preparedness. We maintain contingency plans to mitigate the impact of catastrophic events, power outages, and cyber threats, which are critical for maintaining organizational resilience. 

The 2018 global restructuring program aims to streamline our manufacturing supply chain and reduce costs, which is expected to enhance operational efficiency. This program will impact all business segments and geographies, necessitating workforce reductions and the divestiture of lower-margin businesses. The anticipated annual pre-tax savings from this restructuring are expected to contribute to our resilience strategies by improving our financial health and operational effectiveness. 

We continue to focus on generating cash flow and allocating capital to shareholders, with a commitment to disciplined capital management. Our ability to adapt to environmental disruptions and respond effectively to changing market conditions is essential for maintaining organizational strength and achieving major objectives. The implementation of strategic tools and mechanisms to enhance our resilience will be critical in navigating the complexities of the business environment. 

In summary, our strategic response to external pressures, including competitive dynamics and market volatility, underscores the importance of organizational resilience in ensuring sustained performance and adaptability in the face of adversity.

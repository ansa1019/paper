The statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operation. Factors that might cause such a difference include risks inherent with the G&K transaction, including the performance and costs of integration of acquisitions, which may involve unforeseen difficulties and require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and resources. Unexpected events, including natural disasters, unplanned outages, and supply disruptions, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. We have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested; however, our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to system conversions, power outages, and catastrophic events. Our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information and process transactions, and any disruption could adversely affect our sales and operational continuity. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, as these statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Negative global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance, and changes in federal and state tax and labor laws may alter the landscape in which we do business. The ability to open new operating facilities is necessary for our expansion efforts, and any inability to effectively identify and manage these items may adversely affect our financial performance. Our outstanding indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business, increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions. The integration of G&K may involve significant transaction and integration expenses, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. We believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture, which depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees. Competitive pressures may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain these employees, which could adversely affect our businesses. Our ability to find qualified suppliers is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located outside the United States. The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, and our ability to access products in a timely and efficient manner is critical to our operational effectiveness. We are subject to various litigation claims that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations. The operation of our businesses entails risks under environmental laws, and we could incur significant costs as a result of violations. We regularly engage in environmental due diligence in connection with acquisitions, but we cannot assure compliance with all applicable laws. We continue to evaluate our internal controls, including those related to the acquired G&K business, and we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure effective internal control over financial reporting in the future. Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity, and we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future. The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended to increase the capacity of the revolving credit facility, which supports our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives.

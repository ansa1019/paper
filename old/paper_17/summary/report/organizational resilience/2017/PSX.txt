Our operating results and future rate of growth are exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining, marketing, and petrochemical margins. The prices of feedstocks and our products fluctuate substantially, influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand, local market conditions, and government regulations. Uncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms, adversely affecting our financial strength and operational flexibility. Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at times when we need access, which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations, which may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand for our products. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the refined products we produce. Climate change may adversely affect our facilities and ongoing operations, with potential physical effects including rising sea levels and changing storm patterns. Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Our operations could be subject to significant interruption if one or more facilities experience a major accident, mechanical failure, or severe weather event. A significant interruption could lead to increased volatility in prices for feedstocks and refined products, making it more difficult for us to access capital and obtain adequate insurance coverage. Our performance depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, which are increasingly reliant on information technology systems. Disruptions in these systems due to catastrophic events or security breaches could significantly impair our ability to manufacture products. We strive for operational excellence, focusing on safety, environmental stewardship, reliability, and cost efficiency, which are fundamental to maintaining organizational health. Continuous improvement in safety and operational practices is a priority, as is the optimization of utilization rates at our refineries. We encourage collaboration throughout the company, valuing diversity and creating a supportive work environment. Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk, as we share control with partners who may have conflicting interests. We conduct operations through joint ventures and must manage risks associated with acquisitions or partnerships effectively. The chemicals industry is cyclical and volatile, with changes in supply and demand affecting our operations. Our ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and NGL is critical for maintaining throughput levels in our midstream operations. We are committed to protecting the environment and strive to reduce our environmental footprint throughout our operations. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing functional and technical skills, fostering a learning organization that adapts to complex situations and external pressures. We are dedicated to improving our organizational resilience through proactive measures, strategic foresight, and the development of adaptive strategies that enable us to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities in a turbulent market environment.

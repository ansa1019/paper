We are subject to the business, financial, and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth. Our business is subject to significant competition from multiple hospitality providers worldwide, changes in operating costs, and increases in costs due to inflation or other factors that may not be fully offset by price and fee increases. Macroeconomic factors beyond our control can adversely affect demand for our products and services, including changes in general economic conditions, governmental action, and political instability. The hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility, which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to maintain our competitive position depends on our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations. We rely on our relationships with third-party property owners and franchisees to sustain our management and franchise business, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to market changes. We have established a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure our strategies in response to environmental pressures. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global footprint and fee-based business, which requires effective resource allocation and the ability to absorb strain while preserving or improving functioning despite adversity. We have taken steps to reduce fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions while continuing to optimize the overall customer experience. Our investments in owned and leased properties are subject to various risks that may limit our ability to respond to market conditions, including governmental regulations and the ongoing need for capital improvements. We depend on our ability to establish and maintain long-term relationships with third-party property owners, which is critical for our growth and operational continuity. Our business operations are also vulnerable to various risks associated with our information technology systems, which are essential for maintaining operational integrity and efficiency. Cyber-attacks and disruptions to our information systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations. We recognize that our organizational resilience is multifaceted, reflecting our ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes to survive and flourish. Our ability to attract and retain skilled employees is crucial for maintaining operational effectiveness, particularly during periods of economic strain. Labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business, resulting in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations. We are also subject to risks related to compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations, which may increase costs, reduce profits, or limit growth. Our strategic response to these challenges includes proactive measures to enhance our organizational capabilities and ensure our long-term sustainability in a volatile business environment.

The company’s operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally, which can lead to reduced capital expenditures by customers and decreased demand for products. The demand for products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, and higher unemployment. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges. The company relies on suppliers for material required for the manufacture of products, and disruptions in deliveries or decreased availability of raw materials could adversely affect the ability to meet commitments to customers. The business is also subject to risks associated with labor unrest and negative publicity, which could affect operations and financial results. Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase the cost of doing business or disrupt operations, resulting in physical damage to manufacturing facilities or distribution centers and delays in the delivery of products. The company has taken significant restructuring and cost reduction actions in recent years to optimize its cost structure, which may reduce profitability in the periods incurred. The success of the business depends on the ability to develop, produce, and market quality products that meet customer needs, which requires leading-edge innovation and effective sales and marketing programs. The company operates in a highly competitive environment, and the ability to maintain competitive advantage is crucial for sustaining performance. Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact results, and the company is exposed to political and economic risks in the countries where it operates. The occurrence of adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping capacity, or other disruptions could negatively impact business performance. The company actively manages information technology security risks, as cybersecurity threats pose a risk to systems and data integrity. The company’s financial products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry, and the inability to access funds could adversely affect operations. The company is also subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws, and violations could disrupt business and result in adverse effects on reputation and financial condition. The company’s operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply could expose it to penalties or clean-up costs. The management of the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund operational requirements and commitments, and it continuously assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes from legal proceedings and regulatory compliance risks. The company’s strategic initiatives focus on maintaining a strong financial position, optimizing operational efficiency, and enhancing customer value through innovation and effective resource management.

We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. Our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions, which can occur abruptly and impact our ability to manage our business model transition to cloud-based products and more flexible product licenses. To address the industry transition, we accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible product licenses. Our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance and costs related to product defects. Rapid technological changes, as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences, characterize the software industry, requiring us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy. We are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects, which reflects our commitment to operational flexibility and adaptability. 

We have commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings, which is part of our effort to ensure business continuity and maintain performance under pressure. The transition to a subscription model has had a broad impact, particularly in emerging economies, where sales of perpetual licenses historically comprised a greater percentage of total sales. Our dependency on international revenue exposes us to significant regulatory, global economic, and political risks, which could adversely impact our financial results. We are also subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets. 

Our executive management team must act quickly and with vision, given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry. We have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potential impact of catastrophic events, although there can be no assurance that these plans would enable us to return to normal business operations. The ability to adapt our business model to meet customer requirements is critical for our organizational resilience. 

We rely on third-party technologies and services, and any interruption or delay from these third parties could expose us to liability and harm our competitiveness. Our business strategy has historically depended on our relationships with third-party developers, and disruptions in product development and delivery cycles could negatively impact our business. We are committed to maintaining an open-architecture design of our software products to facilitate third-party development of complementary products, which enhances our organizational strength and resilience. 

Our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter, making future revenue and financial results difficult to predict. We are making significant investments in technology and infrastructure to support our business model transition, which may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs. If we are unable to successfully complete our restructuring efforts, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including customer demand and our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure.

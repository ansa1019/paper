This section highlights specific risks that could affect our business, including general economic and market risks, changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment, and the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. A prolonged period of economic volatility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to recover debt may be limited, and the process and models used to estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses may become less reliable if volatile economic conditions cause actual losses to diverge from projections. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control and may change rapidly, negatively influencing our revenue, costs, earnings, growth, liquidity, and capital levels. We face intense competition in all markets, which may affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, which may increase costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. We are embedding technology deeply into our business model, which can be a challenge due to the fast pace of digital transformation. Our operational risk management program is designed to ensure that we deliver high-quality and consistent customer experiences while achieving business objectives. We recognize the criticality of managing operational risk and have implemented appropriate policies and controls. Our risk framework includes establishing governance processes, identifying and assessing risks, and developing controls to manage risk within tolerance levels. We continuously monitor market and economic conditions to evaluate emerging stress conditions and appropriate action plans. Our liquidity practices ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand potential impacts from deposit attrition or diminished liquidity. We assess liquidity strength by evaluating balance sheet metrics under severe stress scenarios. Our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk. We employ a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk, which includes establishing risk appetites and monitoring adherence to these appetites. Our eight major categories of risk include compliance risk, credit risk, legal risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, reputation risk, and strategic risk. The chief risk officer is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures, including underwriting and monitoring credit exposure. We continuously assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, which involves evaluating historical loss experience, recent trends in delinquencies, and general economic conditions. Our credit policies establish standards in customer selection, underwriting, monitoring, remediation, and portfolio management. We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk, and we track delinquency and nonperforming asset rates as key metrics. Our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure, and we engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk. We maintain a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources and have established liquidity reserves to support our operations.

Our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S. government, for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in this customer's priorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. The U.S. government has the ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default based on performance, which could adversely affect our reputation and ability to compete for other contracts. Significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs may negatively impact our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. The uncertainty surrounding the federal budget and potential changes in priorities could adversely affect funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers. In the event government funding for our significant programs becomes unavailable or is reduced, our contracts may be terminated or adjusted. 

We face various investigations, claims, disputes, and legal proceedings that could divert financial and management resources and harm our business. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and compliance requires significant operating and capital costs. We may incur substantial remediation costs related to environmental conditions, which could materially affect our reputation and financial position. Our business is also subject to disruption caused by natural and environmental disasters, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position. 

We rely on subcontractors and suppliers to provide raw materials and components, and disruptions or performance problems could impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. Our ability to perform obligations on time could be adversely affected if subcontractors or suppliers are unable to deliver products or services in a timely manner. We are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and changes in these regulations could significantly increase our costs and risks. 

Our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain the necessary capabilities to meet customer needs. The markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, and our ability to develop innovative products is essential to maintaining our competitive position. We must also attract and retain a qualified workforce, as our operating results are heavily dependent on personnel with requisite skills. 

The integration of acquired businesses presents challenges that could disrupt our operations and affect our ability to realize anticipated benefits. We must navigate complex regulatory environments and manage risks associated with compliance and operational performance. Our ability to adapt to changes in the business environment, including geopolitical factors and market volatility, is critical to sustaining organizational resilience. 

Overall, our organizational resilience is influenced by our capacity to manage risks, adapt to changing conditions, and maintain operational continuity under challenging circumstances.

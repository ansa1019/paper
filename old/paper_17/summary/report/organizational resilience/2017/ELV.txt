The ongoing changes in federal and state laws and regulations stemming from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) continue to represent significant challenges to the U.S. health care system, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We have made adjustments to our premium rates and geographic participation based on our experience in public exchange markets to date, and we will continue to evaluate the performance of our public exchange plans going forward. The individual market risk pool that includes public exchange markets has become less healthy since its inception in 2014, and the reduction of the individual mandate penalty to zero is expected to result in further deterioration of the overall individual market risk pool. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting health care costs and on our ability to manage future health care costs through medical management, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts, and underwriting criteria. Changes in health care practices, demographic characteristics, inflation, new technologies, and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health care may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care costs. We face significant government regulation, and changes in the regulation of our business by federal and state regulators may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business is subject to regulation at the federal and state level, and future regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products. We are subject to various risks associated with participating in Medicaid and Medicare programs, including dependence upon government funding and compliance with government contracts. The ACA has introduced new risks, regulatory challenges, and uncertainties, requiring changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed, and administered. We believe our pricing strategy, brand name, and network quality will provide a strong foundation for membership growth opportunities in the future. Our strategy has been to participate in rating regions where we have confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability. We have built a significant portion of our current business through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances, which we expect to pursue in the future. However, some of these business combinations may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings, or cash flow, and we may experience difficulties in integrating these combinations successfully. We are also subject to risks related to litigation, which may affect our business operations and financial condition. Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success, and intense competition for qualified employees may adversely affect our business. We maintain a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Our investment strategy aims to minimize financial risk while maximizing returns, and we regularly evaluate the impact of the ACA and other regulatory changes on our business model and results of operations. The health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We have contingency plans and insurance coverage for potential liabilities, but these may not be sufficient to cover all claims and liabilities. Cybersecurity remains a priority as we continue to enhance our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems from attack and unauthorized access.

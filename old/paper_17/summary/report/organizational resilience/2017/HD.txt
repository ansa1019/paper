The risks and uncertainties described could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services and could decrease our market share. Our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in supply chain management. Intense competitive pressures from competitors could affect our prices, margins, or demand for our products and services. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to these competitive pressures, our market share and financial performance could be adversely affected. Our success depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, consumer preferences, and unexpected weather conditions while managing appropriate inventory levels. We must continually anticipate and adapt to changes in the purchasing process and customer expectations regarding delivery options. We have invested significantly in our stores and technology to enhance customer experience, but we cannot guarantee that these investments will meet customer expectations or improve our competitive position. Disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand and result in lost sales. We rely extensively on information technology systems to manage operations, and failures in these systems could significantly disrupt our operations. Our ability to maintain a high level of product and service quality is critical to our reputation and sales. We must also manage our installation services effectively to avoid lost sales and reputational damage. The implementation of strategic transactions involves risks that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs of doing business. Our international operations face unique challenges that could negatively impact our sales and profit margins. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices and demand for our products. We are predominantly self-insured for various risks, and significant claims could adversely impact our financial condition. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, as well as general economic conditions. Adverse conditions beyond our control could further negatively affect demand for our products and services. We are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of our business, and changes in these laws could impact our operations. We must effectively manage our relationships with suppliers to ensure timely access to quality products. Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, but they also expose us to increased risks. Failure to manage these risks could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. Our ability to attract, develop, and retain qualified associates is essential for maintaining customer service levels. We face significant competition in the labor market, and high turnover rates in hourly positions can lead to increased training and retention costs. We must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes to safeguard against data security breaches and comply with evolving regulatory requirements.

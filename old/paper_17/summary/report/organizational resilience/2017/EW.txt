Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty, which could adversely affect our organizational resilience. If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete, impacting our operational flexibility and overall performance. The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes and evolving industry standards, necessitating continuous adaptation to maintain competitive advantage. We devote significant financial and other resources to research and development, which is essential for innovation and maintaining our organizational health. However, the research and development process is prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty, which could affect our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Supply interruptions could harm our ability to manufacture products, as we rely on a broad range of raw materials from third-party vendors, and general economic conditions could adversely affect their financial viability. We work closely with suppliers to monitor their financial stability and assure continuity of supply, but these efforts may not always be successful. Our manufacturing and warehousing facilities are subject to risks from natural disasters, which could significantly impact our operational continuity and resilience. If we encounter manufacturing, logistics, or quality problems, our business could suffer, reflecting the importance of maintaining high-quality standards and effective crisis management strategies. We may also seek to dispose of underperforming operations or products, which could result in substantial charges that adversely affect our results of operations. The health care industry is experiencing consolidation, which increases the complexity of transactions and may exert downward pressure on pricing, thereby impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to compete is closely tied to our capacity to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technological advances, and keep pace with competitors. We face intense competition, and if we fail to recruit and retain a talented workforce, our competitive position may be adversely affected. The regulatory approval process for new products requires extensive clinical trials, which are inherently uncertain and could delay our ability to bring new innovations to market. Our success depends on maintaining strong relationships with key physicians, who provide valuable knowledge and experience. External factors such as economic and political conditions can also affect our profitability and financial condition, as they may impact our customers' ability to purchase our products. We are subject to rigorous governmental regulations that could result in substantial costs and affect our operational resilience. Our operations are also impacted by environmental, health, and safety regulations, which could lead to increased liabilities. The medical technology industry is subject to greater scrutiny and regulation, which may lead to increased compliance costs and exposure to litigation. Our organizational resilience is further challenged by the need to manage complex tax positions and the potential impact of changes in tax laws. We continuously evaluate our operational strategies and financial commitments to ensure we can adapt to changing market conditions and maintain our organizational effectiveness.

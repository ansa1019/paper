Investing in our securities involves risks, including unforeseen developments that could delay acquisitions or cause them to occur on less favorable terms, impacting our operational flexibility and competitive position. Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets, and we depend on the current and future business environment, including capital and consumer spending, to maintain organizational health. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers, which requires effective resource allocation and the ability to adapt to technological changes and shifts in customer demand. We may experience difficulties in the research, development, production, and marketing of new products and services, which could negatively impact our performance under pressure and our ability to recoup investments. Our intellectual property rights are crucial for maintaining a competitive advantage, and failure to protect these rights could adversely affect our organizational resilience. We engage in acquisitions and divestitures, which require effective integration of assets and personnel, and we may encounter difficulties that hinder our ability to realize anticipated benefits. Our operations depend on production facilities worldwide, which face increased risks from environmental perturbations, including natural disasters and political unrest, that could disrupt production and affect our ability to meet customer needs. The volatility in capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments, impacting our financial resources and ability to execute our business plan. Our success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining key personnel whose skills and experience are vital for organizational effectiveness. Security breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our operations, exposing us to risks that challenge our resilience strategies. We are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Our management believes that the financial statements reflect the expected effects of events and transactions, and we rely on a system of internal accounting control to safeguard assets and ensure operational continuity. The companyâ€™s financial structure provides the flexibility necessary to achieve strategic objectives, and we routinely assess the impact of economic conditions on our operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations supports growth and investment in our businesses, and we monitor market conditions to project future performance. We expect favorable economic growth in emerging markets, which will require strategic initiatives to adapt to changing market dynamics. The company has been successful in deploying cash efficiently to fund operations and sustain long-term growth, while also managing risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The strategic portfolio repositioning actions completed in fiscal 2017 are expected to enhance our organizational agility and resilience, enabling us to respond effectively to future challenges and capitalize on market opportunities.

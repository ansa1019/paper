The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, which have historically affected our revenue, cash flows, profitability, and growth. These factors create significant uncertainty and may materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations are capital intensive, requiring substantial capital expenditures for exploration, development, and production, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms. Concerns over general economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is crucial. We have developed a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure these trajectories toward the future. Our success depends on finding, developing, or acquiring additional reserves, which is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the availability of capital, construction of infrastructure, and regulatory changes. We continuously monitor and adjust our projected capital expenditures in response to success or lack of success in drilling activities, changes in prices, availability of financing, and other factors. Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water, and restrictions on our ability to obtain water may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have incurred losses from operations during certain periods and may do so in the future, which could impede our ability to economically find, develop, and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. Our drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the potential for unprofitable efforts and operational difficulties. The concentration of our producing properties in the Permian Basin exposes us to risks associated with regional supply and demand factors and potential delays or interruptions of production. We depend on several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production, and the loss of one or more of these purchasers could limit our access to suitable markets. Our ability to manage growth in our business is critical, as we face additional demands on our financial, technical, operational, and management resources. The failure to upgrade our systems or recruit and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on whether significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity and mitigating risks associated with market volatility. Our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, which may impose additional obligations and increase our exposure to penalties for non-compliance. We face risks related to environmental, health, and safety requirements that could impose significant costs and liabilities. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and effectively manage our resources is vital for sustaining our organizational resilience and achieving our strategic objectives.

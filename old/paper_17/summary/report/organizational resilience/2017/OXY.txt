Occidental's strategy is focused on delivering a unique shareholder value proposition through continual enhancements to its asset quality, organizational capability, and innovative technical applications that provide competitive advantages. The company aims to maximize shareholder returns through a combination of consistent dividend growth, value growth through oil and gas development that meets above cost-of-capital returns, targeted production growth rates, and maintenance of a strong balance sheet to secure business and enhance shareholder value. Occidental conducts its operations with a focus on social responsibility commitments and initiatives, including health and safety, and environmental stewardship. The company seeks to limit its financial and political risks, positioning the business to thrive in both up- and down-cycle commodity price environments. Recent strategic initiatives have resulted in Occidental exiting non-core areas and strengthening its position in areas where it has a competitive advantage. The oil and gas segment focuses on long-term value creation and leadership in health, safety, and the environment, benefiting from scale, technical expertise, and commercial and governmental collaboration. These attributes allow Occidental to bring additional production quickly to market, extend the life of older fields at lower costs, and provide low-cost growth opportunities with advanced technology. The oil and gas business implements Occidental's strategy by focusing on cost-reduction efficiencies, improvement in new well productivity, and better base management to reduce total spend per barrel. Occidental's operations are subject to various risks, including commodity pricing volatility, operational impacts such as production disruptions, and governmental actions that may affect its results of operations. The company bears risks associated with equipment failures, construction delays, and disappointing drilling results, which may affect its ability to profitably grow production and achieve targeted returns. Occidental's businesses are also subject to the decisions of many federal, state, local, and foreign governments, which may impose new or amended laws and regulations that could restrict or prohibit activities, increase costs, or reduce demand for its products. The company recognizes that exposure to risks may increase if a greater percentage of its future oil and gas production or revenue comes from international sources. Occidental's oil and gas reserves are estimates based on professional judgments and may be subject to revision, with actual production, revenues, and expenditures potentially varying from estimates. The company acknowledges that concerns about climate change and further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may adversely affect its operations or results. Additionally, Occidental's businesses may experience catastrophic events, including hurricanes, floods, and cyber-attacks, which could significantly affect operations. The company has implemented controls and multiple layers of security to mitigate the risks of cyber-attacks, although there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches. Occidental's strategic initiatives aim to enhance operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptive events, ensuring the maintenance of performance and organizational health under challenging conditions.

Our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control, and unfavorable conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances have impacted and may impact future demand for our products and services, negatively affecting our revenues and earnings. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales, affect our margins, constrain our operational flexibility, and result in unusual or nonrecurring charges. Our extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal risks, and currency translation, which could decrease profitability. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to penetrate markets outside the United States, particularly in high-growth markets, where we may face greater risks than those in mature economies, including political and economic instability and project abandonment due to unanticipated government actions. Successful operation of particular facilities may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage, or terrorism, requiring us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations temporarily. Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers or customers, negatively impacting our business, financial results, and cash flows. Our operations could be impacted by severe weather conditions, epidemics, or acts of war and terrorism, which could cause serious business disruptions affecting our ability to produce and distribute products. We are subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe, and compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could reduce profitability. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that do not fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. Our ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow depends on our ability to identify, successfully acquire, and integrate businesses and assets, realizing expected synergies and operating efficiencies. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms or at all, and our results may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses to meet expected returns or the discovery of unanticipated liabilities. The security of our information technology systems could be compromised, adversely affecting our ability to operate efficiently. We depend on information technology to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and if we do not effectively manage the necessary resources, we could face transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, or business disruptions. Our business involves the use, storage, and transmission of sensitive information, and breaches of our security measures could expose us to risks of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in legal claims and penalties under privacy laws. We are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and compliance with these laws may require significant expenditures that could adversely affect financial results. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, and we have established policies to help protect sensitive information. The potential demand for clean technologies may create opportunities for us, and we continue to develop technologies to help lower energy consumption and emissions.

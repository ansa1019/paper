The implementation of new laws or regulations or the uncertainty around potential changes may impact participation in our markets or the demand for our clearing and data services either favorably or unfavorably. Many of the recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing, and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented, and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. Economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, has affected our clients' activities in recent years. We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 21% in 2013 to 58% in 2017. This non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings, and other revenues. We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, and markets. Many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including increasing global regulatory demands, greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations, greater emphasis on risk management, market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes, and ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets. The move to passive investing and indexation, increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets, the development of new data products, and the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity are also expected to drive growth. We contract with clients through data fixed-fee subscriptions, variable fees based on usage, or a combination of fixed-fee subscription and usage-based fees. We have diversified our business to maintain operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and environmental perturbations. Our operational resources and strategic initiatives are designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and resilience, enabling us to confront unexpected situations and mitigate risks. The financial markets environment is characterized by uncertainty, and our ability to adapt to changing conditions is critical for maintaining competitive advantage. We have implemented mechanisms for recovery and transformation in response to disruptive events, ensuring that we can maintain performance under pressure and sustain organizational health. Our organizational practices emphasize collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration, which are essential for fostering resilience and supporting our strategic objectives. We recognize the importance of emotional resources and social capital in navigating complex situations and enhancing our organizational dynamics. The ongoing evaluation of our operational management practices and strategic adaptation strategies will further strengthen our organizational resilience in the face of future challenges.

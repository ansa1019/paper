Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and we face various risks and uncertainties that could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable due to factors outside our control, including our ability to attract and retain customers, changes in market demand, and the timing of orders. The effectiveness of our sales organization and the seasonal buying patterns of our end-customers also contribute to this unpredictability. We are dependent on the overall demand for information technology and the economic health of our customers, which can adversely impact our business, particularly during economic downturns. Our reliance on a concentration of shipments at the end of each quarter could cause our billings and revenue to fall below expected levels if anticipated orders are delayed. 

We are subject to risks associated with international sales and operations, including economic or political instability in foreign markets, difficulties in enforcing contracts, and changes in regulatory requirements. Our ability to manage our inventory effectively is crucial, as insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities, while excess inventory could harm our gross margins. Disruptions in our supply chain, including those caused by natural disasters or geopolitical events, could significantly impact our ability to fulfill customer orders. 

We rely heavily on our senior management team to execute our business plan, and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our strategic objectives. Our future performance depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, particularly in engineering and sales. The competitive landscape is characterized by intense competition, and we may lack the resources to maintain or improve our competitive position. 

Our business model requires us to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and customer needs, and failure to do so could harm our competitive position. We are also subject to risks related to warranty claims, product returns, and defects, which could adversely affect our reputation and financial results. Our products must interoperate with those from other vendors, and any problems could delay market acceptance and harm our business. 

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with various laws and regulations, including those related to data privacy and cybersecurity, is essential, and failure to comply could result in significant penalties. 

Our operating results have been impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations, and we must continually assess our tax positions and the potential for future tax liabilities. We expect to continue investing in research and development to drive innovation and maintain our market position. Our ability to manage growth effectively, including through the expansion of our real estate holdings and improvements to our systems and processes, is critical to our operational success. 

Overall, our business is subject to various internal and external pressures that could impact our resilience and ability to adapt to changing market conditions.

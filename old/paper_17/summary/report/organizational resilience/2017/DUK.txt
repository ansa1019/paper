Duke Energy's future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy successfully. The company’s strategy, including transforming the customer experience, modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy, and engaging employees and stakeholders, is subject to business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. The ability to recover costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and organizational health. The regulated utility businesses are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation and natural gas transmission, which may limit their ability to recover costs. Regulatory, legislative, and legal risks could negatively impact future earnings, particularly if exclusive rights to serve regulated customers were eroded. The Duke Energy registrants' businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation and a wide variety of laws and governmental policies that may change over time, potentially affecting operations and costs. 

Operational risks, including natural disasters and economic downturns, may adversely affect results of operations. The company is exposed to risks associated with overall market conditions that are beyond its control, which could lead to declines in demand for electricity or natural gas and negatively influence operations. The ability to adapt to unexpected situations and reconfigure operational strategies is essential for maintaining performance under pressure. The company’s operational flexibility is further challenged by regulatory changes that can cause delays in business planning and transactions, substantially increasing costs. 

Duke Energy's commitment to operational excellence is reflected in its focus on safety and efficient operations, which are critical for resilience in the face of environmental perturbations and other external pressures. The company continues to invest in infrastructure improvements and innovative technologies to enhance customer satisfaction and operational resilience. The integration of Piedmont Natural Gas is expected to strengthen the company’s position in the natural gas market, which is a vital component of its long-term strategy for cleaner energy generation. 

Duke Energy's financial position is influenced by its ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce, which is essential for managing and operating the business, particularly in the context of nuclear generation facilities. The company’s strategic initiatives include stakeholder engagement to ensure that regulatory rules benefit customers and allow for the timely recovery of significant investments. The successful implementation of these initiatives is crucial for achieving organizational success and maintaining a competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment. 

The company’s approach to risk management involves ongoing assessments of its operational capabilities and the potential impacts of regulatory changes, ensuring that it remains agile and responsive to evolving market conditions. The ability to foresee and confront challenges, including those posed by climate change and regulatory compliance, is integral to the organization’s resilience strategy.

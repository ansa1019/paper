The growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. The increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips and integrated circuits, and customers' concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general. Demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls. Furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. Our customers frequently incorporate third-party IP into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. We work closely with major foundries to ensure that our EDA, IP, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. If we fail to optimize our EDA and IP solutions, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Uncertainty in the global economy may negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending, and/or delay their payments to us. Such caution by semiconductor companies could limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts. We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, which could hurt our ability to grow our business

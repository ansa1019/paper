Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the U.S., which exposes us to difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations, local business and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards, and volatility in currencies. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting the value of our properties and our ability to make principal and interest payments on debt. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks, despite system redundancy and disaster recovery plans. We depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. Our performance could be impacted by deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, which may not prevent all errors or misstatements. We pursue growth opportunities in international markets where we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, exposing us to risks of economic downturns in that sector. General economic conditions and events affecting the areas where our properties are located may impact financial results. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually and may self-insure based on analyses prepared by outside consultants. We are exposed to various environmental risks, including potential impacts of future climate change, which may result in unanticipated losses. Our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses, and we cannot be sure that insurance companies will continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. We are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to maintain our REIT status, which may require borrowing funds on a short-term basis to meet distribution requirements. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms depends on various factors, including general market conditions and the market's perception of our growth potential. We have formed co-investment ventures, which involve risks such as our partners' economic interests potentially conflicting with ours. We seek to maintain sufficient influence over these ventures to achieve our business objectives, but we may not be able to do so indefinitely. We evaluate our business operations based on net operating income (NOI) of our segments and consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance. Our operating fundamentals remain strong, with high occupancy rates across our portfolio. We believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities and distributions from our co-investment ventures is adequate to meet our anticipated future development and operational needs. We have invested significantly in real estate development and leasing costs, and we expect to continue to develop new properties as opportunities arise.

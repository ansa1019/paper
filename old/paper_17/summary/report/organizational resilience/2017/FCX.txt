This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws, which include expectations relating to operational flexibility and the impact of external pressures on financial performance. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially include fluctuations in market prices of copper, gold, and molybdenum, which may adversely affect our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and maintain operational continuity. Our financial results will vary with these fluctuations, and we may need to revise our operating plans, including curtailing production and reducing operating costs, which could impact our organizational resilience. Our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the industry, increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions. The ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures may also be constrained, which could affect our operational management and strategic initiatives. 

We are subject to extensive regulations that may impose additional requirements on our operations, potentially affecting our ability to adapt to complex situations and maintain organizational health. Our international operations face political, social, and geographic risks that could disrupt our functioning and require strategic responses to ensure survival and competitive advantage. The ongoing negotiations with the Indonesian government regarding long-term mining rights illustrate the need for resilience strategies to manage regulatory uncertainties and ensure future operational success. 

We must continually assess our operational resources and capabilities to mitigate risks associated with environmental obligations and asset retirement obligations. The complexity of our operations necessitates effective resource allocation and knowledge management to enhance our adaptability and performance under pressure. The potential for significant environmental remediation costs highlights the importance of proactive measures in our operational planning. 

Our mining operations are subject to operational risks, including natural disasters and labor unrest, which could adversely affect our business continuity and necessitate crisis management strategies. The importance of careful design and monitoring of our tailings management systems reflects our commitment to maintaining system integrity and minimizing hazards. 

In summary, our organizational resilience is contingent upon our ability to navigate external disturbances, manage resource constraints, and implement effective change management processes. The interplay of market volatility, regulatory challenges, and operational complexities underscores the necessity for strategic foresight and adaptability in our business operations.

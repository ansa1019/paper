Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures to manage domestic and international growth effectively. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively, which includes increasing the productivity of our existing employees and continuing to hire, train, and manage new employees as needed. We may not be able to successfully implement improvements to our systems and processes efficiently or in a timely manner, and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness. Our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner, may result in disruption of our current operations and end-customer relationships, our inability to manage the growth of our business, and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries, including the risks described elsewhere in this annual report. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be adversely affected. We expect that our results of operations will vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers and attract new end customers is critical, as is our ability to develop, market, and sell new products and services that are acceptable to our customers. Changes in the budgeting cycles, purchasing practices, and buying patterns of end customers could also impact our revenue. Our ability to fulfill end customers' orders may be affected by the availability of inventory, supply chain delays, and access to key commodities or technologies. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with third-party technology. Additionally, we face intense competition, and our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price. We are currently involved in litigation that could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to risks, including manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping end-customer orders on time. We are also subject to risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations, including compliance with various regulations and the ability to establish necessary business relationships. Our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability, and product defects, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business. We must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends, evolving industry standards, and changing end-customer needs. Our ability to manage product introductions and transitions is crucial for maintaining our competitive position. We believe that our long-term value as a company will be greater if we focus primarily on growth instead of profitability, which may result in lower profitability in any given period. Our future performance will depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, particularly in software engineering and sales. If we are unable to hire, retain, train, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could suffer.

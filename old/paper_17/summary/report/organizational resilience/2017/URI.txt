Our business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could impair our organizational resilience. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities. Our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments and limiting our flexibility to react to such developments. A worsening of economic conditions could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results. We depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include reducing or delaying capital expenditures, limiting our growth, seeking additional capital, selling assets, or restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness. Our operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect, as their success depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. We have been pursuing a strategy of optimizing our field operations to improve sales force effectiveness and to focus on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers. We continue to implement lean management techniques across our branch network, with the objectives of improving service quality and operational efficiency. Our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets. We have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions, and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis. The restructuring program initiated following the closing of recent acquisitions includes actions focused on driving profitable growth through revenue opportunities and generating incremental profitability through cost savings across our business. Our ability to comply with loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing. We are exposed to various claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully cover them, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters, and changes in these requirements can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business. We are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms, and the termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives or support our online ordering system. Our ability to maintain the security of the data we hold is critical, as any compromise or breach could result in adverse publicity, harm our reputation, and affect our relationships with our customers and employees.

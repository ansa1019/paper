During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a liability of $30.0 million as an estimate of potential losses associated with anticipated claims and assessments by payment card networks, reflecting our commitment to risk mitigation and management of external pressures. We have removed malware from our systems and continue to evaluate ways to enhance our security measures, demonstrating our proactive approach to crisis management and organizational resilience in the face of disruptive events. Our results of operations improved as we opened more restaurants and hired more employees, which contributed to increased operational flexibility and adaptability. The significant factors contributing to the increase in revenue were new restaurant openings and comparable restaurant sales increases, indicating our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. We expect comparable restaurant sales increases in the low single digits for the full year 2018, including the benefit from extending menu price increases to additional restaurants, which reflects our strategic response to market conditions and customer needs. Our investment in improving digital platforms, including enhancements to our mobile application and online ordering, illustrates our focus on service innovation and operational continuity. We anticipate that labor costs as a percentage of revenue will be higher in 2018 due to labor inflation and enhanced benefits, which aligns with our strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing organizational health and employee engagement. The decrease in food, beverage, and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue in 2017 was primarily due to the benefit of menu price increases and cost savings initiatives, indicating effective resource allocation and operational management. We have also recognized the need for ongoing adaptation strategies in response to environmental disruptions and inflationary pressures affecting food and labor costs. Our history of claims experience is relatively short, and our significant growth during most of our operating history could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience, highlighting the complexity of managing organizational risks. We have recorded liabilities related to a number of legal actions, and while we are unable to predict outcomes with certainty, we are committed to maintaining organizational coherence and resilience through effective legal and operational strategies. The adoption of the tax cuts and jobs act will allow us to use a portion of the savings to provide enhanced benefits to our employees and invest in our existing restaurants, which is expected to increase labor, other operating, and general and administrative expenses. Our management team continues to focus on strategic adaptation and organizational transformation to ensure long-term sustainability and success in a competitive landscape. As we navigate these challenges, our emphasis on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration will be crucial in enhancing our operational effectiveness and resilience.

This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of our products, which are subject to rigorous regulatory enforcement by the FDA and other governmental authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals can be costly and time-consuming, and failures to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in sanctions, including substantial fines and product recalls. We may be adversely affected by product liability claims and unfavorable court decisions, exposing us to significant legal expenses. Our reliance on certain suppliers exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated price increases, which could adversely impact our competitive position. We operate in a highly competitive industry where technological advancements can render our products obsolete. Our ability to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals is crucial for product development and market success. We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions, which inherently carry risks, including the integration of new businesses and the potential loss of key personnel. We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business, and failures in these systems could expose us to reputational and business harm. Our ongoing implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system is a major undertaking that could adversely affect our operations if disruptions occur. We are committed to maintaining operational continuity and flexibility in response to environmental perturbations and unexpected situations. Our financial condition reflects our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and access capital markets, which supports our strategic initiatives and resource allocation for growth. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from various sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases, which are essential for sustaining competitive advantage and organizational health. We have made investments in research and development to foster service innovation and enhance our product offerings, reflecting our commitment to organizational resilience through adaptability and strategic foresight. The ultimate cost to resolve certain ongoing legal matters may be materially different from current estimates, which could adversely affect our financial position and operational effectiveness. We continuously evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, recognizing that changes in tax legislation and economic conditions may impact our future financial results.

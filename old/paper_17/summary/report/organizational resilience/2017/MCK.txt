The healthcare industry in the United States has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes. These changes have included cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, shifts towards value-based payments and risk-sharing models, and increases in the use of managed care. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to evolve, which may affect our business operations and results. Our distribution solutions segment has experienced weaker pharmaceutical pricing trends over the last three years, and continued volatility in the availability and pricing of generic drugs could materially impact our results of operations. The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation could impose increased costs, negatively impact profit margins, and delay the introduction of new products. We are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, which could expose us to litigation and regulatory investigations. Our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws that prohibit certain practices and impose restrictions on referrals and claims for payment. Changes in reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and medical treatments could adversely affect our profit margins and those of our customers, impacting our ability to charge prices that maintain profitability. 

We have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, but there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective. Our business relies on secure electronic transmission and storage of sensitive information, and a failure or compromise of our systems could result in significant operational and financial consequences. We face risks associated with sourcing products and contract manufacturing from foreign countries, including regulatory compliance and potential disruptions due to political or economic changes. Our expansion into retail markets may also present increased competitive and operational challenges. 

We regularly evaluate our portfolio to determine whether assets or businesses may no longer help us meet our objectives. When we decide to divest, we may encounter difficulties in finding buyers or experience greater dissynergies than expected. Our investment in Change Healthcare represents a significant aspect of our strategy, and any failure to manage this relationship could adversely impact our results. We are also subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could materially affect our financial position. 

Our ability to conduct business may be negatively impacted if we experience difficulties with outsourcing and managing third-party relationships. We rely on third parties to perform certain services, and if these providers fail to perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties. The company's future results could be materially affected by public health issues, which could disrupt operations and impact consumer spending. We must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans, and any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to sell services. 

We are committed to a multi-year strategic growth initiative aimed at improving patient care delivery and driving profit growth, which includes a comprehensive review of operations and cost structure to increase efficiency and performance.

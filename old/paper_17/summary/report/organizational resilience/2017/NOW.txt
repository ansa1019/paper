Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and we have identified various risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers' confidential information, and while we have security measures in place, these may be breached, resulting in unauthorized access to our data. The markets in which we compete have evolved rapidly, and to compete effectively, we must accurately predict our customers' changing business needs and successfully deliver new platform technologies that meet these needs. If we fail to meet these requirements, our competitive position may be harmed. Our business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers, and various factors may cause implementations to be delayed or unsuccessful, which could result in significant costs and harm our reputation. Disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers' businesses and subject us to substantial liability. Our operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters and other events beyond our control, which could make it difficult to deliver our services and cause us to incur substantial expenses. We have maintained crisis management and disaster response plans; however, such events could lead to lengthy interruptions in our services and loss of customer data. Our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may impact our revenues and operating results. The competitive landscape is intense, and we may not be able to compete successfully, which could result in reduced sales and margins. Our ability to attract and retain employees is critical, as our success depends largely on our management team and key individual contributors. We face significant competition for skilled personnel in the technology industry, and failure to retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business and growth prospects. Changes in laws and regulations related to data privacy and the use of the internet may also impact our ability to provide services globally. We have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods; however, we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline, and we may continue to incur losses due to increased costs. Our ability to manage risks associated with foreign markets and our international sales is crucial, as we are subject to regulatory and economic risks that differ from those in the United States. We are also exposed to risks related to compliance with governmental laws and regulations, including privacy laws, which could impose additional burdens on our operations. Our future effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly based on changes in tax laws and regulations, and we may incur substantial expenses related to compliance. Our business operations are subject to various risks, including the potential for significant losses from security breaches, the need for substantial investments in technology and infrastructure, and the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages in international markets.

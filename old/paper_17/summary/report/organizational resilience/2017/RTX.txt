Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by global economic, capital market and political conditions, which may affect our ability to maintain operational continuity under challenging circumstances. Tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, potentially resulting in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services. Additionally, our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries, which are influenced by external factors including fluctuations in economic activity, regulatory changes, and geopolitical risks. A slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect financial performance, while the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry ties our results directly to economic conditions. Future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues, or major natural disasters could dramatically reduce demand for air travel, impacting our sales and margins. Our international operations expose us to economic risks, including changes in foreign currency fluctuations and local government regulations, which may affect product demand and reported profits. We engage in acquisitions and divestitures, and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our competitive position and operational effectiveness. Our reliance on suppliers and commodity markets exposes us to volatility in prices and availability of materials, and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to customers. The success of future acquisitions will depend on our ability to integrate businesses and realize anticipated benefits, including operational efficiencies and innovation opportunities. Our business may be affected by government contracting risks, including the potential for reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs under fixed-price contracts. We are also subject to litigation and compliance risks that could materially impact our financial condition. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by attacks on information technology infrastructure and other cyber-based disruptions, which could result in unauthorized release of confidential information and operational delays. We continue to invest in measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities to mitigate potential risks. Furthermore, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our competitive position. Our competitive position may also be impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain necessary licenses concerning data important to our products or services. We may face challenges in managing workforce reductions or restructuring activities, which could disrupt operations and impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions. Overall, the multifaceted nature of our operations and the external pressures we face necessitate a strategic approach to resilience, emphasizing the importance of adaptability and proactive measures in response to environmental disruptions.

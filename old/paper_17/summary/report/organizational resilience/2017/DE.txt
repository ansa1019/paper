The following risks are considered significant to John Deere's business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions, and should be closely considered in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise this discussion, which includes various interrelated risks that could affect its operations and performance. John Deere's profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace, and restricted access to global markets impairs its ability to export goods and services and access raw materials at competitive prices. Trade restrictions could limit John Deere's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and adversely affect its competitive position. Additionally, changes in government policies, including those affecting exchange rates and commodity prices, could have a material adverse effect on demand for agricultural and forestry equipment. John Deere's operations are also impacted by economic conditions, which can weaken demand for its products and limit access to funding. Negative economic conditions can significantly reduce customer confidence and purchasing likelihood, affecting sales across various segments, including construction and turf operations. The company is subject to currency exchange risks due to its operations in multiple currencies, and fluctuations in exchange rates can materially affect its financial results. The financial services segment, which provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere's sales, is exposed to risks associated with customer defaults and market conditions. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment and adversely affect the financial services segment's profitability. John Deere's business operations are also subject to risks associated with supply chain disruptions, which can arise from various factors, including supplier financial distress and natural disasters. The company relies on a network of suppliers for raw materials and components, and disruptions in this network can affect production and profitability. Furthermore, John Deere's operations are influenced by increasingly stringent environmental regulations, which could impose additional costs and affect its ability to manufacture and distribute certain products. The company must also navigate the complexities of international operations, which expose it to various cultural, legal, and regulatory challenges. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact agricultural production and demand for equipment, while changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect demand for John Deere's products. The company is committed to adapting to changing circumstances and enhancing its resilience strategies to maintain operational continuity and performance under pressure. John Deere's ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel is critical to executing its business strategy, and challenges in this area could impair its operational effectiveness. The potential loss of intellectual property and compliance with anti-corruption laws also pose risks to the company's reputation and financial condition. Overall, John Deere's operations are characterized by a need for adaptability and resilience in the face of various external pressures and uncertainties.

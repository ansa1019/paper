This section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations, and financial condition, emphasizing our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity. We are exposed to operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, economic conditions, competition, and regulatory changes. Our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control, partner insolvency, or disputes, which may require us to expend additional resources to resolve such disputes and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture. We continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments and monitor our investments through various methods, including reviewing financial statements and property inspections. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate, or transfer the risk, which supports both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment. Our asset management process includes evaluating the operating environment in each property's market to determine the likely trend in operating performance. We structure our investments to help mitigate payment risk, and our operating leases are typically structured as master leases to enhance resilience against operational challenges. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical, and we face risks associated with government reimbursement programs that could materially affect our obligors' liquidity and financial condition. Our operators' or tenants' failure to comply with various regulations could adversely affect their operations and, consequently, our ability to receive payments. We are subject to risks associated with debt financing, which may limit our ability to acquire additional properties. The dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services presents ongoing challenges that could impact our business. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from legal proceedings and disputes, which could lead to increased costs or interruptions in normal business operations. Our ability to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile is essential for organizational resilience, and we must comply with various covenants in our debt agreements. We are also exposed to market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which could impact our financial condition. Our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, and competition for their talents is intense. We cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. The ability to adapt to changes in the competitive landscape and respond to unexpected situations is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and achieving our major objectives.

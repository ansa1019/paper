Our business depends upon the demand for data centers, and a reduction in this demand would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We face significant competition, which may adversely affect the occupancy and rental rates of our data centers. Changes in industry practice or technology could reduce demand for the physical data center space we provide or necessitate significant upgrades to remain viable. Our substantial development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns and adverse developments in the data center and technology industries. Any such slowdown could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or demand for data center space. Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service, and any failure could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business reputation and financial condition. Problems at one or more of our data centers could result in service interruptions or equipment damage, exposing us to liability under our lease terms. We may be vulnerable to breaches of our physical and information security infrastructure, which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our dependence on significant customers means that their financial condition could materially affect our revenue, particularly if they experience downturns or fail to make timely payments. We may lose customers if they choose to develop new data centers or expand their existing operations elsewhere. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer may adversely affect our income. Our ability to attract and retain a diverse customer base is critical for maximizing revenues, and failure to do so could harm our business. Our operations may be affected by local economic conditions, and downturns in these areas could materially adversely affect our performance. We depend on third-party suppliers for power and services, and service failures could disrupt our operations. Our portfolio is geographically concentrated, and changes in these regions can impact our results. We may not be able to adapt to changing technologies and customer requirements, which could render our data center infrastructure obsolete. The growing acceptance of data center assets has pushed capitalization rates lower, and we anticipate that single-asset acquisitions will comprise a smaller percentage of our growth until seller price expectations realign with our return requirements. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations, including those related to taxation and environmental standards. Our ability to manage our growth effectively is crucial, and any deficiencies in our management could negatively impact our financial condition. We may face risks related to our international acquisitions, including unfamiliarity with local markets and regulatory environments. Our success depends on key personnel, and losing their services could materially affect our business. Our liquidity and capital resources are influenced by our operating partnership's ability to make sufficient distributions, and we may need to rely on external sources of capital to fund our operations and growth. The impact of global economic conditions on our liquidity and access to capital cannot be underestimated, as disruptions could adversely affect our ability to meet obligations and pursue strategic initiatives.

Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including deteriorating economic conditions that may adversely impact demand for our products and reduce access to credit. The economic health of our customers is affected by factors such as general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, and consumer confidence. Adverse changes in these factors could lead to decreased demand for our products, negatively impacting our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, and natural disasters may result in the closure of our distribution centers or other facilities, affecting our ability to deliver inventory to our stores. We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory and process transactions, and disruptions could negatively impact revenue and our results of operations. The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, requiring us to expend resources and risk capital to remain competitive, which could adversely impact our financial condition. Our ability to open additional profitable stores is a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives, which depend on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions and general business conditions. We must also retain and motivate key employees, as our success largely depends on their efforts. Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers, and financial or operational difficulties faced by them could increase the cost of products we purchase or affect our ability to source products. We expect to continue to make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, but acquisitions involve risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from expectations. Business interruptions in our distribution centers may affect our store hours and the availability of merchandise, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales, and extreme weather conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of automotive parts. Our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs is critical, and changes in employment legislation could hinder our ability to control costs. We believe that our ability to preserve, grow, and leverage the value of our brand is essential for our continued success. Our liquidity and capital resources are influenced by our ability to generate funds from operations and the impact of decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offerings to adjust to changing customer preferences, and we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term capital needs. Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores and expand distribution infrastructure, and we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows. The occurrence of events described in our risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

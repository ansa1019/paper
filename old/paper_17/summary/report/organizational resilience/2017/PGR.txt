Our business involves various risks and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives. Management divides these risks into categories, including operating risks stemming from external or internal events that may affect our insurance operations. We cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed may develop into actual events and impact our businesses, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. Our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, which is subject to uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, including our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and predict future losses. The realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data, negatively affecting our underwriting profit margins, or reducing our competitiveness and growth prospects. Our success also depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors' initiatives, as well as our ability to manage complexity in developing and delivering high-quality products and customer experiences. Ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, informational, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and systems, which may create barriers to innovation or the provision of high-quality products. Our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees is critical to our success, and our failure to recognize the need for adjustments in staffing levels could lead to over-staffing or under-staffing, adversely affecting our financial results and employee morale. Our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform necessary functions efficiently and uninterruptedly, and any shut-down or unavailability of our systems could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions. We must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers, and our ability to improve brand recognition and perceptions is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments, and our ability to implement business plans while complying with these laws is critical to our success. Compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which may adversely affect our profitability or ability to operate our business. Our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems, and we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive information. Our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions, and any disruption could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects. The inability to access cash accounts or convert investments into cash on favorable terms may materially and adversely affect our business, as could the performance of our investment portfolios, which are subject to various investment risks. Our financial condition may also be adversely affected if parties with which we transact business become insolvent or default on their obligations.

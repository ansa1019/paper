An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. A downturn in global economic conditions could adversely affect operations, particularly in emerging markets and countries with government-sponsored healthcare systems, potentially leading to decreased demand for products and services, increased competition, and interruptions in supply. The medical technology industry is highly competitive, with significant competition from large medical device companies and specialized firms, which could impact operational flexibility and strategic initiatives. Changes in customer preferences, including increased demand for environmentally-friendly products, and rapid technological change could also affect the company's ability to innovate and adapt to market needs. The company faces foreign currency exchange risk, as a substantial amount of revenues are derived from international operations, which may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in reimbursement practices by third-party payers could affect demand for products and pricing, impacting organizational health and financial performance. Legislative reforms, such as the reinstatement of the medical device tax, could adversely affect results of operations. Consolidation in the healthcare industry could intensify competition and exert additional pressure on pricing. Cost volatility in raw materials and components may negatively impact operations, while breaches of information technology systems could disrupt operations and lead to significant negative consequences. The company relies on information technology systems for day-to-day operations, and cyber-attacks could result in unauthorized access to systems and products, impacting organizational resilience. The success of operations outside the United States depends on the ability to form and maintain alliances with local companies and enhance infrastructure, which is critical for navigating complex situations and environmental perturbations. The integration of acquired businesses, such as CareFusion and the pending acquisition of Bard, presents challenges that could affect organizational effectiveness and the realization of anticipated benefits. The combined company's ability to manage expanded operations will depend on strategic adaptation and the implementation of effective resilience strategies. The company must also navigate uncertainties associated with international operations, including compliance risks and potential violations of anti-corruption laws, which could adversely impact reputation and operational continuity. The ability to attract and retain key employees is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring organizational success. The future results of the combined company may be adversely impacted if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the Bard acquisition, emphasizing the need for operational management and strategic foresight.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, which requires us to adapt our operational practices and protocols to maintain functioning under challenging conditions. In response to the pandemic, we implemented new practices and protocols, including enhanced cleaning protocols and occupancy limitations, which resulted in additional expenses while potentially impacting sales opportunities. The pandemic has required us to make decisions about precautionary measures that could impact our brand reputation, associate retention, and customer willingness to shop. Our ability to allocate and deliver merchandise has been impacted by temporary store closures and global supply chain disruptions, which may continue to affect our operations and financial performance. We must effectively manage our inventory and respond to customer demand to maintain operational flexibility and performance under pressure. The competitive landscape has intensified, requiring us to effectively react to rapidly changing opportunities and trends in the market. Our business model allows for greater flexibility than many traditional retailers, enabling us to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market conditions. However, failure to meet customer expectations or identify trends could negatively impact our performance. The size and scale of our operations present challenges in managing resources effectively and ensuring cohesive practices across our multiple banners and locations. The ongoing pandemic has also affected our workforce, impacting our ability to recruit and retain associates, which is critical for maintaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness. We are subject to various risks related to sourcing merchandise globally, including supply chain interruptions and compliance with international regulations, which could adversely affect our financial results. Our substantial size can make it challenging to run complex operations effectively, and we must ensure that our systems, controls, and practices are implemented consistently throughout the organization. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to reduce risks, but these controls require ongoing investment and may not fully eliminate potential disruptions. The dynamic regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy poses additional challenges, as any compromises could materially harm our reputation and operational integrity. Our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions, catastrophic events, or public health crises, which could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to serve customers effectively. The ability to maintain positive adjustment under these challenging conditions is essential for our organizational resilience and long-term success. We continue to monitor developments and adapt our strategies to mitigate risks and enhance our operational capabilities, ensuring that we can confront external pressures and maintain our competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment.

An investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those that can impact organizational resilience. The ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability, and quality of commodities and subsystems are factors that can affect our ability to adapt and maintain operational flexibility under challenging conditions. Our revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government, and changes in government spending can pressure various areas of our operations, potentially impacting our financial performance and resilience. U.S. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay, which can affect our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. The annual budget process may be delayed or disrupted, impacting funding for our programs and the timing of new awards. Our contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer, and the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings. We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audits by the U.S. government, which can result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed. Our ability to perform on contracts depends on subcontractor and supplier performance, and reliance on a limited number of suppliers can adversely affect our commitments. Our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet customer needs, which is crucial for sustaining organizational health and adaptability. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions, affecting our operational continuity and the ability of our employees to work effectively, which could impact our performance under pressure. We have implemented measures to mitigate adverse consequences to our employees, business, supply chain, and customers, demonstrating our commitment to resilience strategies. The pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that could lead to a prolonged economic downturn, negatively affecting demand for our products and services. Increased regulation related to global climate change may impose significant new costs and operational restrictions, further challenging our organizational resilience. Our emphasis on cash flow generation and prudent capital deployment reflects our strategic response to maintain flexibility and support long-term growth. We evaluate capital deployment options based on current market conditions and our long-term outlook, which is essential for adapting to changing environments. Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, is indicative of our future revenue potential and resilience in navigating market volatility. Our ability to manage risks associated with international operations and changing budget priorities is critical for sustaining our competitive advantage and ensuring organizational survival. The diverse nature of our programs and customers, along with our insight into customer requirements, supports our organizational strength and capacity to confront challenges.

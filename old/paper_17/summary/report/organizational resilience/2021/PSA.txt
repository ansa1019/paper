We have significant exposure to real estate risk, and natural disasters or terrorist attacks could cause damage to our facilities, resulting in increased costs and reduced revenues. The consequences of climate change, including severe weather events, could result in increased capital expenditures, increased expenses, and reduced revenues. We have undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce emissions and energy consumption, which align with our commitment to sustainability in our business operations. Governmental, political, and societal pressure could require us to accelerate our initiatives and result in costly changes to our facilities to reduce carbon emissions. Our ability to raise capital to fund our activities may be adversely affected by challenging market conditions, which could limit prospective earnings growth through expanding our asset base. Economic downturns or adverse economic conditions could negatively impact our financial results and growth. We are subject to risks from the COVID-19 pandemic, including potential out-migration from high-cost markets and restrictions that limit our ability to operate our facilities. We have been adversely impacted by emergency regulations adopted in response to significant events, which could limit our operational flexibility. Our marketing and pricing strategies may fail to be effective due to increased competition and regulatory constraints. We are exposed to ongoing litigation and legal actions that may divert management's attention and resources. Our failure to modernize and adopt advancements in information technology may hinder our ability to achieve strategic objectives. We are heavily dependent on automated information technology and the internet, and any disruption could significantly harm our business. The secure processing and maintenance of sensitive data is critical to our operations, and we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems to address evolving information security risks. Ineffective succession planning for our CEO and executive management may impact the execution of our strategic plan. Our financial profile enables effective access to capital markets to support growth, and we believe we have significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing conditions. Our expected capital resources include cash on hand, net proceeds from equity offerings, and retained operating cash flow. We expect to satisfy our cash requirements through operating cash flow and opportunistic debt and equity financing. We have a robust pipeline of development projects, but our ability to acquire additional properties may be constrained by market conditions and competition. We continue to seek to acquire additional self-storage facilities, and our development and expansion projects are expected to enhance our competitive position. Our operations are subject to various risks, including environmental contamination and changes in governmental regulations, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and grow. We expect continued revenue growth supported by high customer demand and a stable tenant base, allowing us to raise rates while maintaining high occupancy levels.

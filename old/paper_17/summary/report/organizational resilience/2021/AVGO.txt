Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted normal business activity and may continue to do so. The pandemic has resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays, impacting our ability to procure necessary components and meet customer demand. We have modified our workplace practices globally, resulting in many employees working remotely for extended periods, which may reduce efficiency and productivity, potentially causing product development delays and hampering new product innovation. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic limits our ability to predict its future impact on our business. We depend on a small number of end customers for a majority of our business, and any reduction in demand from these significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our reliance on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain poses risks to our ability to bring products to market and could damage our reputation. A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business. We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, and any substantial disruption in the contract manufacturing services we utilize could materially harm our customer relationships and results of operations. We purchase a significant amount of materials from a limited number of suppliers, and any supply constraints could negatively impact our customer relationships and result in loss of revenue opportunities. Our business is also subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses. Adverse global economic conditions could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and liquidity. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and characterized by rapid technological change, which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results. We face competition from numerous companies that may have greater resources, which could prevent us from growing our revenue. Our ability to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity and product yields is critical to meet anticipated customer demand, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our relationships with customers. We must also manage our operational resources effectively to respond to fluctuations in demand, as failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain could adversely affect our results of operations. Our strategy includes pursuing acquisitions and investments, which involve risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations. We are also subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners, including fluctuations in demand based on inventory levels. The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses, which may adversely affect market acceptance and our reputation. We are committed to investing in research and development to remain competitive, but unsuccessful investments could materially affect our business. Overall, our ability to adapt and respond to these challenges is essential for maintaining operational continuity and achieving our major objectives.

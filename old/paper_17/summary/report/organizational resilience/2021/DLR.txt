Our business and operations, and our customers, suppliers, and business partners may be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks, which could lead to significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of such illnesses, including quarantines and travel restrictions. These events could materially and adversely impact our operations and the rental revenue we generate from our agreements with our customers. We may experience supply chain or procurement disruptions, or increased supply chain costs, which may lead to delays and could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. Our ability to adapt to changing technologies and customer requirements is critical, as our data center infrastructure may become obsolete if we cannot meet new demands without incurring significant costs. We depend on significant customers, and many of our data centers are single-tenant properties, making us vulnerable to their financial health. The development of new technologies may render our customers' current products obsolete, increasing the likelihood of defaults under their leases. Our portfolio depends upon local economic conditions and is geographically concentrated in certain locations, which could adversely affect our business if these areas experience downturns. We have made investments to update and modernize our information technology systems, but transitioning to new systems can create difficulties, including potential disruptions to current processes and cybersecurity complexities. We may be unable to lease vacant or development space, renew leases, or re-lease space as leases expire, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition. Our business depends upon the demand for data centers, and a reduction in this demand could have a greater adverse effect on our business than if we owned a portfolio with a less specialized use. We face significant competition, which may adversely affect occupancy and rental rates of our data centers. Any failure of our physical or information technology infrastructure could lead to significant costs and disruptions. We may be vulnerable to breaches or unauthorized access to our systems, which could expose us to legal liability and damage our reputation. Our ability to attract, grow, and retain a diverse and balanced customer base is essential for maximizing revenues. Our contracts with customers could subject us to significant liability, and we may not be able to limit our liability in the event of losses. We may not be able to adapt to changing technologies and customer requirements, which could adversely impact our ability to sustain and grow our business. Our dependence on third-party suppliers for power makes us vulnerable to service failures and price increases. Our international activities expose us to risks different from those we face in the United States, including political and economic instability. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility and uncertainty, impacting our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic or pandemic on our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. We may not be able to effectively manage our growth, and our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. Our ability to manage risks associated with the sales cycle and to maintain operational flexibility is critical to our organizational resilience.

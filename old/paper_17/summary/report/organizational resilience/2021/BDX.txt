An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those associated with public health threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable, and we may experience significant challenges to our global transportation channels and other aspects of the global supply chain network, including to the cost and availability of raw materials and components due to shortages and resulting cost inflation. We have developed and launched multiple products for the detection and identification of COVID-19, and our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we meet changing market demands in terms of our product offerings and marketing approaches. The global outlook remains uncertain as case counts fluctuate and vaccination rates remain relatively low in many parts of the world. We are subject to risks associated with public health threats, including the potential for new governmental lockdowns or restrictions that could weaken demand for certain of our products and disrupt our operations. Our ability to attract and retain key employees is critical to our competitive position, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. We rely on information systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including sensitive personal or proprietary information. Cyberattacks could result in unauthorized access to our systems and products, which could impact our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations. The long-term effects of global climate change present risks to our business, as extreme weather or other conditions could adversely impact our supply chain and the availability and cost of raw materials and components required for the operation of our business. We are subject to extensive regulation, and our operations are affected by complex state, federal, and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, and other areas. Our international operations expose us to various risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, local political conditions, and changes in local healthcare payment systems. The success of our operations outside the United States depends on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to our production facilities and sales and distribution networks. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include countries whose healthcare systems are expanding. Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operating activities providing us with the capacity to accelerate our innovation pipeline through investments in research and development. We remain focused on partnering with governments, healthcare systems, and healthcare professionals to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure continued availability of BD's critical medical devices and technologies. Our ability to sustain long-term growth will depend on expanding our core business, developing innovative new products, and improving operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial condition are dependent on various factors, including the extent to which resurgences in COVID-19 infections may result in future deferrals of elective medical procedures and the degree to which the pandemic has escalated challenges that existed for global healthcare systems prior to the pandemic. We are committed to fostering a purpose-driven culture with a focus on positive impact to all stakeholders, improving our ability to serve customers, and enhancing customer experiences through the digitalization of internal processes.

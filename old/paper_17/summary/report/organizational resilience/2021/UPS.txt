Our business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has significantly affected our operations, financial performance, and liquidity. The pandemic has resulted in weakened economic conditions, significant supply chain disruptions, and ongoing economic uncertainty, which could materially adversely affect us. We are unable to predict the full extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact us, as the future effects remain uncertain and depend on evolving factors. We conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories, and changes in general economic conditions, including cyclicality affecting national and international economies, may adversely affect us. Our industry is rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition that could materially adversely affect us. We must timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures to maintain our profitability. Failure to attract or retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect us, as we depend on the skills and continued service of our employees. Our strategic initiatives, including transformation, have led to the creation of fewer but more impactful jobs, which may affect our ability to retain experienced and motivated employees. Increased security requirements and potential attacks or security breaches could materially adversely affect us. Strikes or work stoppages by our employees could also adversely affect our ability to meet customer needs. Our success depends on maintaining our brand image and corporate reputation, as service quality issues could tarnish our brand image and negatively impact demand for our services. We rely on information technology networks and systems for various operational processes, and disruptions to these systems could result in material adverse effects on our business. The effects of climate change present financial and operational risks, and we have made public commitments to reduce carbon emissions, which may require significant resources. Severe weather or other disasters could disrupt our business, and we are exposed to economic, political, or social developments that could materially adversely affect us. Our inability to effectively integrate acquired operations could materially adversely affect us. We monitor and manage currency exchange rates and interest rate exposure, using derivative instruments to mitigate impacts on our financial condition. Our business requires significant capital investments, and failure to accurately forecast our future investment needs could adversely affect us. Employee health and pension benefit costs represent significant expenses, and increases in these costs could materially adversely affect us. We are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations that could increase our operating costs. We are also exposed to various claims and litigation that could result in significant expenditures. We are committed to executing our customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy, focusing on improving revenue quality, reducing costs, and growing operating profit. We continue to monitor external conditions impacting our business, including supply chain disruptions and rising inflation. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively manage these risks and uncertainties.

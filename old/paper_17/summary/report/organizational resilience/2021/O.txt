The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The pandemic has led to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets, impacting regional, national, and global economic activity. Measures taken to limit its spread have resulted in operational limitations, including closures and restrictions that affect our clients' businesses, potentially causing them to seek reductions or deferrals in their rent payments. The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. The financial impact of the pandemic could negatively affect our credit ratings, interest rates on our borrowings, and our compliance with financial covenants, potentially resulting in defaults that could adversely affect our ability to make additional borrowings or pay dividends. The pandemic has also affected our employees' ability to fulfill their duties, and a general decline in business activity could adversely affect our ability to grow our portfolio. We have taken precautionary measures within our organization to reduce the risk of the virus to our employees and clients, including implementing a work-from-home policy and limiting non-essential travel. These actions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The unpredictable nature of the pandemic may heighten existing risks, including our significant indebtedness and the need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our obligations. Our ability to adapt and respond to these challenges is critical for maintaining operational continuity and financial stability. We face competition in acquiring and operating properties, and negative market conditions could adversely affect our ability to attract new clients or renew leases. The impact of climate change presents additional risks, including physical damage to properties and disruptions to business continuity. Our sustainability strategies aim to comply with laws related to climate change, but failure to implement effective measures could damage our reputation and incur penalties. The integration of our business with that of Vereit poses challenges, including the need to combine operations and systems effectively. The complexities associated with this merger may divert management's attention and resources, impacting our ability to achieve anticipated synergies. Our historical financial information may not be representative of future results due to these changes. The market value of our securities is subject to various factors, including economic conditions and our operational performance. We rely on information technology for our operations, and any failure in these systems could harm our business. The ongoing uncertainty in the financial markets may affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms, which could impact our growth and operational flexibility. Our ability to generate cash flow is essential for making distributions to stockholders and servicing our debt. The challenges posed by the pandemic, competitive pressures, and the need for strategic adaptation are critical considerations for our organizational resilience and long-term success.

We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations, financial results, or stock price, many of which are driven by factors beyond our control. The challenging economic environment triggered by the coronavirus pandemic has impacted our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The pandemic has also impacted our client service quality at times, as response and processing times increased due to high levels of client engagement. We consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience, and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction. We have focused on hiring additional client service employees to address these challenges, although we continue to face difficulties in retaining and hiring employees. Our operational flexibility has been tested due to staffing shortages at call centers and branches, exacerbated by the rapid spread of new variants of COVID-19. Many employees are working remotely, which has contributed to increased response and processing times. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but violations could occur, impacting our operational effectiveness and reputation. Our risk management governance includes operational risk, compliance risk, credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, all of which are critical to maintaining organizational resilience. We have established a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks, including the development of policies and procedures for risk mitigation. Our operational risk management includes maintaining a backup and recovery infrastructure, business continuity plans, and routine testing of disaster recovery plans to ensure capacity to continue operations during incidents. The integration of TD Ameritrade has aligned risk management practices with our risk appetite, allowing us to address new or changed risks impacting the combined company. We have established risk metrics and reporting to measure the impact of strategy execution against our risk appetite, and senior management actively participates in the risk management process. Our liquidity management is crucial for maintaining client confidence and meeting operational needs, with established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during stressed conditions. The company's ability to manage capital effectively is essential for sustaining operations and supporting growth, particularly in response to market volatility and client activity levels. We continuously monitor our capital levels and requirements to ensure we remain well-capitalized, even in stressed scenarios. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing service delivery and operational efficiency, which are vital for maintaining resilience in a competitive landscape. The ongoing integration of technology and operational processes is aimed at improving our adaptability to changing market conditions and client needs, ensuring that we can respond effectively to future challenges.

Abbott's business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties, including operational risks associated with acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances. The complexity of Abbott's information technology systems makes them susceptible to cyber attacks, which could result in increased costs, manufacturing challenges, reputational damage, and legal penalties. Abbott invests in its systems and technology to reduce the risk of significant disruptions and monitors its systems for potential threats. The company must continue to launch new products and technologies to remain competitive, committing substantial resources to research and development despite inherent risks of failure. Manufacturing processes are complex and subject to various risks, including equipment malfunction and supply chain disruptions, which could adversely affect revenues and profitability. Abbott's significant indebtedness may reduce flexibility to respond to changing business conditions and impact working capital availability. The company is subject to rigorous regulatory requirements that can delay product approvals and increase costs, with potential consequences for compliance failures including product recalls and operational disruptions. Public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have negatively impacted operations, causing reductions in demand for certain products and disruptions in manufacturing and supply chains. Abbott has taken steps to align operations with governmental orders during the pandemic and has managed to avoid significant supply disruptions thus far. However, the unpredictability of the pandemic's duration and impact on Abbott's business remains a concern. The company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and achieving major objectives.

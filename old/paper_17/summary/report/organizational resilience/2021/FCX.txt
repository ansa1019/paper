This report contains forward-looking statements in which we discuss our potential future performance, including plans, projections, and expectations relating to business outlook and strategy. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from those anticipated. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially include operational risks inherent in mining, including environmental, safety, and engineering challenges, as well as disruptions, damage, and failure associated with information technology systems. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic activity and markets globally, creating volatility and uncertainty. Our business may be affected by general risks that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally, including geopolitical, economic, and social uncertainties. We recognize that access to clean, safe, and reliable water supplies is vital to the health and livelihood of our host communities, and our mining operations require significant quantities of water, which are subject to competition and climate change impacts. Our operations are also subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws that govern the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances. Compliance with these laws imposes substantial costs and may result in delays or changes to our development or expansion plans. Our ability to attract, retain, and develop qualified personnel is critical to our success, and labor disputes could disrupt operations. We have substantial mineral reserves and future opportunities within our portfolio of mining assets, and we continue to advance innovation initiatives designed to enhance productivity and reduce capital intensity. Our financial policy for the allocation of cash flows is aligned with strategic objectives of maintaining a strong balance sheet and increasing cash returns to shareholders while advancing opportunities for future growth. Our operations are dependent on maintaining good relations with our workforce and the communities where we operate. Failure to effectively engage with communities could adversely impact our business and reputation. We are committed to validating all of our copper-producing sites under the Copper Mark, which demonstrates responsible production practices. Our climate report details efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency, reflecting our commitment to sustainability and resilience in the face of climate-related risks. The physical impacts of climate change may adversely affect our operations, workforce, and supply chain, requiring adaptive strategies to manage these risks. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform our operations to emerge stronger from challenging situations is essential for maintaining operational continuity and achieving our strategic objectives.

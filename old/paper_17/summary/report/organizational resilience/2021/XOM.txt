ExxonMobil's financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses, including the pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities. These risks encompass supply and demand fluctuations, which can significantly affect operations and earnings due to changes in commodity prices and margins. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is closely linked with economic activities and levels of prosperity, meaning that recessions or periods of low economic growth could adversely impact results. The COVID-19 pandemic has further illustrated the need for organizations to adapt to unexpected situations, as it caused rapid demand reductions and significant decreases in commodity prices. ExxonMobil's future business results will depend on its ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and the effectiveness of its own responsive actions to protect the safety and well-being of its workforce. The company recognizes that external pressures, including technological improvements and shifts in consumer preferences, can impact demand and necessitate adaptation strategies. Additionally, operational efficiency is crucial for competitive performance, requiring continuous management focus on technology improvements, cost control, and productivity enhancements. The ability to manage risks associated with operational disruptions, including severe weather events and cybersecurity threats, is vital for maintaining organizational resilience. ExxonMobil employs rigorous management systems and a comprehensive enterprise risk management system to identify and mitigate risks across its businesses. The companyâ€™s preparedness for adverse events relies on robust facility engineering, disaster preparedness, and business continuity planning. Furthermore, the success of ExxonMobil's strategy for energy transition will depend on its ability to recognize key signposts of change in the global energy system and direct investment toward technologies that capitalize on its competitive strengths. The scale of the world's energy system necessitates support from governments and private participants, and the failure or delay of supportive policies could adversely impact investments. The company emphasizes the importance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance its resilience strategies. ExxonMobil's operational flexibility and ability to adapt to changing market conditions are essential for navigating the complexities of the energy landscape. The organization must continuously improve its capabilities to manage its portfolio effectively, ensuring diversification among types and locations of projects. The management's ability to minimize inherent risks and control business activities is critical for sustaining operational continuity and organizational effectiveness. Overall, ExxonMobil's approach to resilience encompasses a multifaceted understanding of external disturbances, resource management, and the necessity for strategic adaptation in the face of adversity.

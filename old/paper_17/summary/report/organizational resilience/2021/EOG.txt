Our business and operations are subject to many risks, including environmental disruptions and external pressures that may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies how global health concerns can lead to operational disruptions and limit our ability to execute on our business plan, impacting our cash flows and overall performance. We recognize the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and resilience strategies to adapt to unexpected situations, such as significant declines in commodity prices, which can affect our ability to finance capital expenditures and operational expenses. The volatility of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices makes it difficult to predict future cash flows, necessitating a robust risk management framework to assess and mitigate potential impacts on our operations. 

In addition, developments related to climate change and regulatory changes may impose additional operational constraints and compliance costs, affecting our ability to sustain production levels and maintain organizational health. We are committed to enhancing our operational capabilities and resilience through strategic initiatives that focus on efficiency improvements and resource allocation. This includes evaluating new prospects and leveraging our internal knowledge to navigate complex situations and maintain competitive advantage. 

Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disturbances and reconfigure our operational strategies is critical for sustaining performance under pressure. We continuously monitor market conditions and adjust our capital allocation strategy to maximize shareholder value while ensuring operational continuity. The integration of advanced technologies and innovative practices in our operations is essential for fostering organizational agility and enhancing our capacity to confront challenges. 

We also recognize the significance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration in strengthening our resilience. Our strategic response to crises and disruptions is informed by a systemic perspective that emphasizes the interconnectedness of our operations and the broader market environment. By fostering a culture of learning and adaptability, we aim to enhance our organizational intelligence and ensure our long-term sustainability in a turbulent market landscape. 

As we navigate through these challenges, we remain focused on our major objectives, including maintaining a strong balance sheet and ensuring the efficient deployment of resources. Our commitment to proactive measures and strategic foresight will enable us to effectively manage risks and capitalize on opportunities for growth, even in the face of adversity. The dynamic nature of the oil and gas industry necessitates a multifaceted approach to resilience, integrating operational management, strategic adaptation, and continuous improvement in our organizational practices.

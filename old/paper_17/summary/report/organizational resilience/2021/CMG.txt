The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, operations, and outlook for an extended period of time. Our restaurant operations have been disrupted by employees who are unable or unwilling to work, which has strained our ability to keep our restaurants fully staffed and negatively impacted employee satisfaction. The pandemic has required us to make difficult decisions about protective measures, which could impact our brand, employee satisfaction, hiring, and retention. We have experienced challenges in recruiting and retaining restaurant employees, which has resulted in longer wait times for guest orders and temporary closures of operations. The market for qualified talent continues to be competitive, and we must provide increasingly competitive wages, benefits, and workplace conditions to retain qualified employees. Our ability to offset higher labor costs by increasing menu prices depends on the willingness of our guests to pay the higher prices, which may decline if competitive pressures prevent us from doing so. The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and our commitment to higher-quality and responsibly sourced ingredients is believed to provide a competitive advantage. However, increasing competition could adversely affect our sales, profitability, and development plans. Our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact our reputation and dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address crisis-level events, including hurricanes and other natural disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a limited test of our ability to manage our business remotely. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data and failures to adequately support field operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the procurement, production, distribution, safety, and sale of our products depends significantly on the availability, reliability, and security of our information technology systems. We rely heavily on these systems, and failures or interruptions could harm our ability to operate effectively. Our business is also subject to extensive laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with existing or new laws could adversely affect our operational efficiencies and ability to attract and retain talent. The ongoing and long-term costs related to climate change and other sustainability issues could have a material adverse effect on our business if we are not able to mitigate them. Our ability to continue to grow our business depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive leadership team and other key management personnel. A failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support our strategic initiatives could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets. The regulatory environment related to privacy and data security is changing rapidly, and our failure to comply with applicable laws could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.

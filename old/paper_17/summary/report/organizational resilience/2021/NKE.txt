Throughout fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business results and operations globally, leading to temporary store closures and reduced operating hours due to mandatory lockdowns. Despite these challenges, we achieved record revenues, reflecting our ability to adapt and respond effectively to external pressures. Our business continuity strategies included leveraging digital platforms to connect directly with consumers, resulting in a 60% increase in digital revenues. The pandemic also highlighted the importance of operational flexibility and resilience in navigating disruptions, as we experienced a 4% increase in comparable store sales driven by growth in key markets. We continue to monitor the evolving situation and may adjust our operating plans based on guidance from health authorities, demonstrating our preparedness for unexpected situations. 

Our strategic initiatives, including the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, focus on enhancing consumer experiences and aligning product creation with consumer needs, which supports our adaptability in a rapidly changing market. We expect these efforts to drive future growth and profitability while mitigating risks associated with economic volatility and market disruptions. The transition to a distributor operating model in certain regions is part of our strategy to optimize effectiveness and reduce exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility, further illustrating our proactive measures in response to complex market conditions.

The diversity of our operational locations and our investments in disaster recovery and business continuity planning position us well to confront potential hazards. However, we acknowledge that operational challenges may arise from local or regional disasters, which could impact our human capital and overall functioning. We have implemented information technology systems critical for managing our supply chain and retail operations, and we continue to invest in enhancing these systems to ensure resilience against disruptions.

Our commitment to product innovation and quality is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and organizational health. We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to meet evolving consumer demands, and our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends is crucial for sustaining our performance under pressure. The ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, particularly for retailers, could affect our sales and ability to collect receivables, emphasizing the need for effective risk management strategies.

We recognize that our organizational culture and the quality of our workforce are vital to our success. The loss of key personnel or negative perceptions regarding our corporate values could harm our business. Therefore, we continue to invest in our workplace culture and employee engagement to ensure we attract and retain high-quality talent. 

In summary, our operational strategies and resilience mechanisms are designed to maintain performance and adapt to changing market conditions, ensuring that we can effectively navigate adversity while pursuing our long-term objectives.

IBM has been moving into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, quantum, and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through responsible innovation. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. The company's financial results for particular periods are difficult to predict, as they are affected by factors such as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, and the length of the sales cycles. The company seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility, and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, artificial intelligence, agile processes, and changes to the ways of working. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity, and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.

Successful cybersecurity attacks could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems, leading to potential liability and damage to brand and reputation. The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities, and while it continues to monitor for and respond to such events, there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity incidents that will have a material adverse effect in the future. The company's reliance on third-party distribution channels and ecosystems could impact its business, as changes in the business condition of these ecosystem partners could affect its ability to bring products to market.

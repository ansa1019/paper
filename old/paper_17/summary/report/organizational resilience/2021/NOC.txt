Our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. The U.S. government has the ability to delay, modify, or cancel ongoing competitions, procurements, and programs, as well as to change its future acquisition strategy. We cannot predict the impact on existing or future programs from potential changes in the threat environment, defense spending levels, government priorities, or broader changes in social, economic, or political demands. Significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and U.S. government funding can negatively impact our business and programs. The budget environment and uncertainty surrounding the appropriations processes remain significant short and long-term risks. If the statutory debt limit is not increased adequately, we could be obligated to work without receiving timely payments. Future funding for certain programs may be reduced, delayed, or canceled, and budget cuts could adversely affect the viability of our subcontractors and suppliers. We face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment, including business slowdowns, labor shortages, supply chain challenges, and market volatility. Our operations have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by the pandemic, which may require us to take extraordinary measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs that may not be fully recoverable. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, we can expect facility closures, work slowdowns, or stoppages, adversely impacting our overall performance. The macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic, including a tightened labor market and government requirements, will likely continue to affect our ability to hire, develop, and retain our workforce. We are subject to various investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, and other legal proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us. The improper conduct of employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers, or business partners can impact our reputation and our ability to do business. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to prevent misconduct, but we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct. We are also subject to various procurement and other laws, regulations, and contract terms applicable to our industry, which could be adversely affected by changes in such laws or negative findings regarding our compliance. Our operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, and compliance with these laws may require significant operating and capital costs. We also face risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts, which could negatively affect our business and operations. Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including geopolitical and economic factors, laws, and regulations. Our ability to win new competitions and meet the needs of our customers depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce. If we are unable to attract and retain a qualified workforce, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position. Our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position. We provide products and services related to hazardous and high-risk operations, which subjects us to various environmental, regulatory, financial, reputational, and other risks.

Our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2021 may contain forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future events, including the rapidly developing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our sales and operations, and we expect it to continue to have adverse effects on our business and financial performance. The situation remains unprecedented and rapidly changing, with unknown duration and severity. We may face required store closures and distribution center closures, which would be very disruptive to our ability to supply merchandise to our stores. We have implemented various measures in our store locations and distribution centers to keep our associates, customers, and communities safe from spreading the COVID-19 virus. These measures include additional cleaning, sanitation, and providing associates with personal protective equipment, which presents significant risk, incremental costs, and uncertainty regarding changing requirements. We are adapting and changing these measures as we learn from experience. Despite our efforts, incidents of infection may occur, potentially resulting in required temporary closures and loss of key personnel during illness, which could disrupt our operations and supply chain. Competitive pressures in the retail industry are high, and our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape could reduce demand for our merchandise and negatively affect our sales and margins. Our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand, and we work continuously to identify customer trends and preferences. Unexpected changes in consumer spending could adversely affect us, and adverse weather may impact shopping patterns and demand. We are at risk for inventory imbalances and potential markdowns due to changes in shopping behaviors resulting from the pandemic. We must effectively manage our inventories, markdowns, and inventory shortage to achieve our planned gross margins. The prolonged pandemic has adversely impacted global economies, resulting in an economic downturn and rising inflation that may reduce consumer demand for our products. We are subject to impacts from the macro-economic environment, financial and credit markets, and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and disposable income. Our operations depend on the integrity, continuous availability, and consistent operations of our information systems, which are critical to processing transactions, managing inventory, and supporting merchandising decisions. Disruptions in our supply chain or information systems could impair our ability to meet customer demand and result in lost sales or increased costs. We must maintain sufficient liquidity to support our operations and growth plans, and the pandemic has added significant uncertainty and challenges in this regard. We are subject to risks associated with selling and importing merchandise produced in other countries, and any disruptions could adversely affect our business. Our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our off-price model in current and new markets, but there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue this expansion. We continually evaluate our store locations and determine closures based on market conditions. Our reputation is partially based on perceptions of integrity, and any incidents that erode trust could adversely affect our business. We face challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient talent, which could negatively impact our operations. The increasing sophistication of cybercriminals and the potential for cyberattacks present risks to our operations and reputation.

The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The pandemic has strained the hospitality industry due to travel restrictions, stay-at-home directives, and limitations on public gatherings, resulting in cancellations and reduced travel. The long-term effects of the pandemic on our business remain uncertain and will depend on various factors, including the duration and severity of illness, the availability and acceptance of vaccinations, and the stabilization of demand and pricing. We have implemented enhanced hygiene and cleaning standards to protect our guests and employees, but we cannot fully predict their impact on public perception regarding travel-related COVID-19 risks. Adverse changes in the perceived economic climate may negatively affect travel demand, and rapid increases in demand could pose challenges due to labor shortages. The steps taken to reduce operating costs during the pandemic, including workforce reductions, may negatively affect our brand reputation and ability to attract and retain employees. Labor shortages have affected our hotels' ability to hire or re-hire employees, which could diminish our operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction. We also face demands from labor unions that could increase costs and potentially lead to labor issues if further mitigation plans are implemented. Even after the pandemic subsides, we could experience long-term impacts on our operating costs due to enhanced health and hygiene requirements. The pandemic has negatively impacted our partners, including third-party owners and service providers, leading to financing difficulties and declines in revenues. This situation increases the likelihood of bankruptcies or foreclosures involving our hotels, which could result in the termination of management or franchise contracts and eliminate anticipated income and cash flows. Current economic conditions could affect our ability to enter into new management and franchise contracts, and delays in our development pipeline may negatively affect overall growth. Our ability to maintain good relationships with third-party property owners is crucial for our business, and any deterioration in these relationships could adversely affect our operational results. We are subject to various risks inherent to the hospitality industry, including competition, changes in operating costs, and compliance with governmental regulations. The hospitality industry is also seasonal and cyclical, contributing to fluctuations in our results of operations. Our strategic objectives include the continued expansion of our global portfolio and fee-based business, but the current economic environment poses challenges to executing this strategy. We are focused on growth through our development pipeline, which is subject to numerous risks, including the ability of developers to access capital. We have taken proactive measures to secure our liquidity position to withstand the negative impact of the pandemic, including issuing senior notes and drawing down our revolving credit facility. Our cash management policy aims to maintain liquidity while minimizing operational costs, and we expect to continue financing our business activities primarily with cash on our balance sheet and cash generated from operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to temporarily change our cash management strategy, but we believe our cash position and sources of liquidity will meet anticipated requirements for operating expenditures in the foreseeable future.

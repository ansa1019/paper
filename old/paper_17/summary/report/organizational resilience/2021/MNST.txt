The COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly impacted our business, and the duration and severity of this impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic with a global task force team working to mitigate the potential impacts on our people and business. Our supply chain remains largely intact, and we have secured additional can manufacturing capacity in the United States for 2022. We have also expanded our network to address supply constraints. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the measures taken by governments and businesses to limit its spread, have impacted our operations, including our ability to recruit and retain employees and the operations of our co-packers and bottlers/distributors. We have experienced global supply chain challenges due to unanticipated increases in demand, which have adversely impacted both cost of sales and operating costs. We have implemented measures to mitigate increased operating costs through pricing actions and reductions in promotions. Our focus on operational flexibility and maintaining good relationships with our bottlers and distributors is essential for our business continuity. The reliance on third-party suppliers for cloud data storage and other information technology services introduces risks related to cybersecurity and operational disruptions. Our ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market conditions is critical for maintaining our competitive advantage. We recognize the importance of innovation in responding to external pressures and ensuring organizational health. The integration of acquired businesses requires careful management to realize expected benefits and mitigate risks associated with cultural differences and operational alignment. We face significant risks associated with our international expansion, including economic and political instability in foreign markets, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and compliance with local regulations. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business and entering new sectors, such as the alcohol beverage sector, which presents both opportunities and challenges. We must continue to develop and introduce innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences while managing costs and maintaining product quality. The ongoing impact of climate change and natural disasters poses additional risks to our supply chain and operational capabilities. We are committed to preserving our brand image and corporate reputation, which are vital for sustaining consumer trust and demand for our products. Our organizational practices emphasize the importance of strategic initiatives, resource allocation, and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity. The ability to manage risks effectively and respond to unexpected situations will be crucial for our long-term success and organizational survival.

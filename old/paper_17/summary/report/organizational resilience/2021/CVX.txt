As a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company's results of operations and financial condition, including the impacts of the continuation or further resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may adversely affect business continuity and operational performance. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's effects on the economy and operational results presents challenges to the company's ability to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency, incorporating potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility. The company evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process, recognizing that extended periods of low prices can have a material adverse impact on financial condition and operational effectiveness. The company's operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control, including severe weather and cyber threats, which could result in significant operational challenges and necessitate effective crisis management strategies. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies and processes to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability, and efficiency risks, aiming to minimize operational risks and enhance organizational resilience. The company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure, emphasizing the need for robust risk mitigation strategies. Additionally, Chevron's operations are influenced by changing political, regulatory, and economic environments, which could adversely affect the company's ability to maintain its competitive advantage and adapt to evolving market conditions. Increasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact the company's operations, as societal and investor pressures to address these issues could lead to increased costs and reduced demand for hydrocarbon products. The company's aspirations to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and other GHG emission-related targets reflect its commitment to strategic adaptation and transformation in response to climate-related challenges. However, these aspirations expose the company to various risks, including operational, regulatory, and reputational risks, which could materially affect its financial performance. The ultimate impact of legislative and regulatory changes related to GHG emissions and climate change on the company's financial performance remains uncertain, as it depends on multiple factors beyond the company's control. Overall, Chevron's ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes is critical for its organizational resilience and long-term success in a turbulent business environment.

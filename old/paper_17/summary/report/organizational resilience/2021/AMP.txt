Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created significant economic and societal disruption. The pandemic has affected our business and operating environment, driven by volatility and changes in equity markets, which could lead to uncertainty in client behavior and financial condition. We actively monitor the potential direct and indirect impacts that the pandemic may have on our segments, recognizing that our ability to manage risks is subject to inherent limitations. The ongoing uncertainties may lead to volatility in volumes, changes in client activity and fees, and impacts on our financial position. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent, which is critical to our organizational resilience. Our ability to attract, motivate, and retain qualified individuals is essential for maintaining operational continuity and achieving our strategic objectives. The impairment or negative performance of other financial institutions could adversely affect us, emphasizing the interconnectedness of our operations with those of our counterparties. We utilize risk management policies and procedures to identify, monitor, and manage risks, although these may not be fully effective in all market environments. Our financial performance relies on our ability to develop, manage, and market new products and services that appropriately respond to evolving client demands and changes in the industry. The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, highlighting the need for effective crisis management and emergency preparedness. We recognize that our reputation is one of our most important assets, and damage to it could significantly harm our business prospects. The ability to maintain our unaffiliated third-party distribution channels is also critical, as access to these channels is subject to intense competition and regulatory trends. Our organizational practices must adapt to the evolving economic landscape, and we are committed to investing in our employees and operational resources to remain competitive. The integration of acquired businesses presents challenges that could disrupt our operations if not managed effectively. Our liquidity and capital resources have remained a source of strength, and we believe our risk management strategy provides proactive protection during stress events. We continue to assess our exposure to various risks, including those arising from acquisitions and divestitures, and we are focused on maintaining operational flexibility to navigate complex situations. The ongoing changes in regulatory environments and market conditions necessitate a strategic response to ensure our organizational resilience and long-term success.

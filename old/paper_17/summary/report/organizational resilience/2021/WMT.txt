The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Our strategy, which includes investments in ecommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint ventures, store remodels, and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our ecommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position, or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and interconnected ecosystem for our customers. Our ability to respond effectively to consumer trends or preferences is critical, as failure to do so could negatively affect our relationship with customers, demand for our products and services, market share, and business growth. The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains unpredictable, and we may be unable to sustain our revenue growth rate in the future. Customer behaviors have changed rapidly during the pandemic, and any resurgence of infections may challenge our ability to anticipate and adjust inventory levels to meet demand. Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, and catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance, leading to physical damage, closure of stores, and disruption in supply chains. The long-term impacts of climate change are expected to be widespread and unpredictable, affecting operational costs and consumer spending. We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our properties or business interruption caused by such events. Our ability to attract and retain qualified associates is essential for operational continuity and success. Changes in laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance, as could changes in tax and trade laws. We strive to adhere to legal requirements, but evolving regulations may require extensive changes, increasing our operating costs. Our compliance programs and risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk, and disruptions caused by security incidents or cyberattacks could harm our operations. The regulatory scrutiny we face amplifies these risks, and we may face audits or investigations that could adversely affect our business. Our reputation may be adversely affected if we fail to achieve our ESG goals, as stakeholders expect significant progress in these areas. The interconnected nature of our operations means that challenges in one area can have cascading effects on others, highlighting the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms to adapt to changing conditions.

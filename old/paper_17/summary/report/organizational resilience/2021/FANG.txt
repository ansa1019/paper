The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including operational, health, labor, logistics, and other challenges presented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which complicates our ability to assess its ultimate impact on our business, financial condition, and cash flows. We have maintained production levels flat during 2021, using excess cash flow for debt repayment and return to our stockholders rather than expanding our drilling program, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. The ongoing pandemic continues to present uncertainties regarding supply chain disruptions, an increasingly competitive labor market, and increased logistics costs, which could adversely affect our operational flexibility and ability to respond to external pressures. We have kept our production flat in 2022 at the fourth quarter 2021 level, reflecting our strategic response to maintain operational continuity under challenging conditions. Our success depends on finding, developing, or acquiring additional reserves, and our future success is contingent upon our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and effectively manage our resource allocation. The volatility in oil and natural gas markets has historically affected our revenue, cash flows, profitability, and growth, necessitating a robust risk management framework to mitigate these external disturbances. Our operational management strategy emphasizes enhancing return through low-cost development and continued improvements in operational and cost efficiencies, which are critical for maintaining performance under pressure. We have also implemented significant enhancements to our commitment to environmental, social responsibility, and governance performance, including emission intensity reduction targets, which reflect our organizational resilience strategies. Our capital expenditures for 2022 are estimated to be approximately $1.75 billion to $1.90 billion, with a focus on drilling and infrastructure development, while remaining flexible to adjust our capital budget in response to commodity price fluctuations. We rely on our ability to secure necessary personnel and resources to execute our drilling activities, and any delays or inability to secure these resources could adversely impact our production volumes. Our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, which may impose additional obligations and increase our operating costs, affecting our overall organizational health. We are also exposed to cyber security risks, which could disrupt our business operations and necessitate enhanced protective measures. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on market conditions, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations is critical for our organizational survival. We have maintained a focus on strategic initiatives that enhance our operational resilience, including the use of commodity derivatives to manage price volatility and the establishment of a robust liquidity framework to support our capital requirements. The concentration of our producing properties in the Permian Basin exposes us to regional supply and demand factors, and we must remain vigilant in our assessment of operational risks and opportunities for adaptation in a rapidly changing business environment.

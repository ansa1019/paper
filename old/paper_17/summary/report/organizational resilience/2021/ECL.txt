The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response have materially and adversely impacted our business and results of operations, with the full impact depending on future developments that are highly uncertain. We rely on a global workforce and take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees while continuing to effectively manage operations. Our business operations may be disrupted if a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely due to illness or government actions. A significant outbreak in one of our manufacturing facilities could adversely impact our ability to make and ship products in a timely manner. Measures taken to address health and safety may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employee base, which could lead to operational disruptions and incur additional expenses. The pandemic has also resulted in supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and logistical challenges, which continue to impact our business. Concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases, triggering additional government-mandated lockdowns. Our operations could be materially affected if we are unable to attract, retain, or develop key personnel necessary for effective succession and management transitions. The dynamic labor market post-pandemic has evolved expectations from qualified talent, and if we cannot meet these expectations, our business could be disrupted or costs could increase. The separation and split-off of our upstream energy business has led to specific indemnity obligations, which could lead to disputes and affect our financial results. The occurrence of extraordinary events, such as litigation, loss of major customers, or severe weather conditions, may significantly impact our business. We have implemented strategic initiatives to improve efficiency and returns, including the institutional advancement program and ERP system upgrades, which aim to reduce complexity and enhance operational effectiveness. Our growth depends on our ability to compete successfully with respect to value, innovation, and customer support, and we must continue to develop and commercialize innovative products. The consolidation of our customers and vendors could adversely affect our pricing and margins. We are subject to various legal, regulatory, and compliance risks that could impact our operations, including environmental laws and regulations. Our operations outside the United States expose us to global economic, political, and legal risks that could affect profitability. We have experienced significant changes in market conditions due to the pandemic, and our results depend on the continued vitality of the markets we serve. We continue to evaluate our cash position and funding requirements in light of future developments, including potential acquisitions and investments in our business. Our ability to manage risks associated with foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks is crucial for maintaining operational and financial health. The ongoing global economic environment remains uncertain, and we expect continued challenges related to supply chain disruptions and inflation.

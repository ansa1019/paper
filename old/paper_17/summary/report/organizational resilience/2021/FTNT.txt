Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described, which are not the only ones we face. Our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable due to several factors outside of our control, including our ability to attract and retain customers, supply chain disruptions, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has created significant volatility and disruption of the financial markets, affecting our ability to manage inventory and meet demand. We have experienced ongoing component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and significant disruption to our production schedule. Additionally, we have seen an increase in expenses and unforeseen liabilities, which could materially impact our operating results. The effectiveness of our sales organization is critical, as we depend on our channel partners for substantially all of our revenue. If our partners fail to perform, our ability to sell our products and services will be limited. We are exposed to credit and liquidity risks of our channel partners, which could result in material losses. The reliance on a limited number of key channel partners means that our revenue and operating results may be harmed if these partners are unable to successfully sell our products. We have implemented programs designed to monitor and mitigate these risks, but we cannot guarantee their effectiveness. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may enhance the severity and unpredictability of risks associated with our international sales and operations, including economic or political instability in foreign markets and compliance with foreign laws. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and the economic health of our current and prospective customers. Adverse economic conditions or reduced spending may negatively impact our business. We may experience longer sales cycles and increased competition, which could adversely affect our ability to grow. Our future performance depends on the continued services and contributions of our senior management, and any loss of key personnel could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives. We are also subject to risks associated with our reliance on third-party manufacturers, which could impair our ability to fulfill orders. The complexity of managing our inventory and the potential for mismanagement could adversely affect our results of operations. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology and operational systems to manage growth effectively. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. The impact of climate change and other catastrophic events could also adversely affect our business. We must remain vigilant in assessing risks and implementing strategies to enhance our organizational resilience, ensuring that we can respond effectively to disruptions and maintain operational continuity.

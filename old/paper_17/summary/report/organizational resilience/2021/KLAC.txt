The COVID-19 pandemic has caused substantial global disruptions, including in the jurisdictions where we conduct business and may cause additional disruptions in the future, which are impossible to predict. Local, regional, and national authorities have implemented measures designed to slow the spread of the virus, including social distancing guidelines and quarantines, which could require us to temporarily curtail production levels or cease operations based on government mandates. The pandemic has resulted in shortages or disruptions in the supply chain that could affect our ability to procure components for our products on a timely basis or at all. We may face disruptions if we cannot access critical information in a timely manner due to system failures, and we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions. Natural disasters, health epidemics, acts of terrorism, or war could significantly disrupt our operations for lengthy periods of time. 

We are exposed to numerous risks as a result of the international nature of our business and operations, including global trade issues, political instability, and compliance with customs regulations. Our ability to manage global operations presents challenges, including exposure to the unique characteristics of each region in the global market, which can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly. We may not be able to maintain our technology advantage or protect our proprietary rights, and reliance on third-party service providers could result in disruptions if such third parties cannot perform services for us in a timely manner. 

Our business model is affected by the concentration of our customer base, which exposes us to increased volatility tied to individual customers. The purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on the economies of both the local markets in which they are located and the condition of the industry worldwide. If we fail to respond to industry cycles, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely impacted. We must be able to adjust our cost and expense structure to prevailing market conditions and continue to motivate and retain our key employees. 

We are committed to operational flexibility and have implemented business interruption planning to minimize the risk of production and service interruptions. Our ability to adapt to changes resulting from difficult macroeconomic conditions is crucial, as any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The complexity of our products exposes us to risks, including unexpected product performance issues that could result in significant costs, including litigation related to defective products. 

We are also exposed to risks related to our financial arrangements, including receivables factoring and banking arrangements, which could adversely impact our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. Our liquidity may be affected by many factors, including uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry. We believe that cash generated from operations, together with existing cash balances and our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other contractual obligations.

In evaluating our business, we note that the dynamic nature of the pandemic, including the availability, uptake, and effectiveness of vaccines and alternative treatments for COVID-19, has created significant challenges that could disrupt our operations and affect our ability to forecast demand accurately. Our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets and has resulted in increased risks and adverse impacts to our operations, including disruptions to our global supply chain and distribution. The pandemic has adversely affected our clinical trials, including our ability to initiate and complete them within anticipated timelines, and has limited patients' ability or willingness to access healthcare providers, resulting in lower demand for our products. We face risks related to the health, safety, morale, and productivity of our employees, which could impact our operational continuity. The pandemic has amplified many of the risks described throughout this report, including fluctuations in purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers and the impact of federal and state budget pressures. Our success depends on developing and commercializing new products or expanding the indications for existing products, and we face significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which could affect our ability to maintain pricing and market share. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers and corporate partners poses risks, including potential disruptions that could result in product shortages or build excess inventory. We must continue to demonstrate the potential advantages of our therapies compared to existing and future therapeutics, and our ability to manage these relationships effectively is critical for our resilience. The introduction of new branded or generic products entering major markets affects our ability to maintain pricing and market share, and we may be adversely impacted if competitors gain market share as a result of new technologies or commercialization strategies. Our operational flexibility is essential for adapting to external pressures, and we must manage our resources effectively to mitigate risks associated with manufacturing difficulties, delays, or interruptions. We are also subject to evolving laws, regulations, and legislative actions applicable to the healthcare industry, which could impose additional pressures on our business. The ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity is crucial, as is our capacity to reconfigure our strategies in response to unexpected situations and environmental perturbations. We continually review our research and development projects based on unmet medical needs and reallocate resources among our internal portfolio and external opportunities to support long-term growth. Our strategic initiatives reflect our commitment to operational resilience and adaptability in the face of complex challenges, ensuring that we can continue to deliver value to our stakeholders while navigating a turbulent business environment.

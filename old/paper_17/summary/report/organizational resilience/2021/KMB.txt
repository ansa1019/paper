Our business faces various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have negative impacts on our business, including causing significant volatility in demand for our products, disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and limitations on our employees' ability to work and travel. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate effect depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control. We have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events; however, if our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Our information technology systems serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business and could be damaged or cease to function properly due to various causes, including catastrophic events and cyber-based attacks. The risk of cyber-based attacks is heightened with many of our employees accessing our technology infrastructure remotely due to the pandemic. We have initiated a global restructuring program to reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization, which has impacted all business segments and organizations across major geographies. The restructuring actions were completed in 2021, and cumulative annual savings have been achieved. Our strategy includes operations growth outside the U.S., especially in developing markets, and we are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and political, social, and economic instability. Our ability to manufacture, distribute, and sell products is critical to our operations and is subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, and pandemics. Disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations could adversely affect our business. We continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, which may include restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. We anticipate ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities, which are aimed at enhancing operational flexibility and resource management. The evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, including increased concerns regarding sustainability and environmental impacts, may also affect our business. Our growth strategy is built on two pillars: elevating our core business through innovation and expanding our markets, particularly in personal care within priority regions. Our strong legacy of financial discipline supports our growth strategy by driving ongoing supply chain productivity and controlling discretionary spending. We are committed to achieving our sustainability goals, which include reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and responsible sourcing, to maintain our organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and market volatility.

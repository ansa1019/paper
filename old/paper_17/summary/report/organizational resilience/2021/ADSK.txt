We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, including those related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures, which have affected how we and our customers are operating our respective businesses. We are continuing to conduct business during the pandemic with substantial modifications, including virtualization and postponement of certain sales and marketing events. The extent of the impact on our business and results of operations remains uncertain, and we are actively monitoring the situation to make further adjustments as necessary. Our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance and costs related to product defects. The software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving customer requirements, necessitating constant evaluation of our business model and strategy. We are focused on providing solutions that enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to customer needs. Our executive management team must act quickly and with vision to meet rapidly changing customer expectations and technological advancements. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work, leading to a hybrid workforce and a reevaluation of our office space needs. We are reducing our facilities portfolio to optimize costs and better deploy capital to drive growth. However, there is no guarantee that we will realize anticipated benefits, including cost savings or operational efficiencies. Our investments in cloud products and a subscription business model provide a robust foundation to navigate economic challenges. We recognize that supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are impacting our recovery pace. Our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions, which can occur abruptly. We are dependent on international revenue and operations, exposing us to significant regulatory, economic, and political risks. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which may entail integration challenges. We have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potential impact of catastrophic events, although there can be no assurance that these plans will enable us to return to normal operations. We are also investing in critical areas such as research and development to support future success as we emerge from the pandemic. Our ability to manage spending and investment effectively is crucial, as any failure could materially affect our cash balances and results of operations. We recognize that our business could be adversely impacted by the costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments, which include risks related to integration, customer retention, and potential liabilities. The complexity of our software solutions may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, which could harm our business and financial performance. Our reliance on third-party technologies and vendors also exposes us to risks that could disrupt our operations. Overall, our ability to adapt and respond to these challenges is critical for maintaining organizational resilience and ensuring long-term success.

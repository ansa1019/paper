Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business and operational continuity. The pandemic has caused disruptions to our operations, resulting in inefficiencies, delays, and additional costs in our product development and customer service efforts. We have experienced volatility in our hardware product delivery times due to delays in obtaining access to customer sites, and access by our employees to laboratory facilities necessary for product development has been disrupted. The impact of the pandemic may increase the possibility of an extended global economic downturn, affecting demand for our products and services. We have also experienced varied operating results, which are affected by the timing of revenue recognition and the mix of products sold. Our operating results for any period are influenced by factors beyond our control, including customer spending constraints and supply chain disruptions. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, characterized by rapid technological change and fluctuations in product supply and demand, poses additional challenges to our operational flexibility and adaptability. We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in global markets, and changes in these regulations may require significant adjustments to our business operations. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain hardware components makes us vulnerable to supply disruptions. We have initiated restructuring plans to better align our resources with our business strategy, although these plans may not achieve the anticipated benefits and could negatively affect employee morale and productivity. The competition in our industries requires us to develop and acquire innovative products to maintain our competitive advantage. Our future revenue growth depends on our ability to integrate acquisitions effectively and to respond to technological developments and customer needs. We must continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings and to meet the increasing technological requirements of our customers. Our ability to attract and retain key employees is critical to our success, and competition for skilled personnel has intensified. The ongoing global pandemic has also impacted our workforce dynamics, including the implementation of a vaccine policy that may affect employee retention. We are committed to maintaining a strong workplace culture and ensuring operational continuity during these challenging times. Our financial condition and results of operations are subject to considerable uncertainties, including the potential for customer bankruptcies and modifications of licenses. We must effectively manage our cash flows and liquidity to meet our operational needs and to navigate the complexities of the current business environment. The evolving nature of international trade relationships and regulatory compliance adds further complexity to our operational landscape, necessitating robust risk management strategies to mitigate potential adverse impacts on our business.

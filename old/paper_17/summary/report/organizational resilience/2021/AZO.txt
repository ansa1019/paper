Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including strategic and operational risks stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow. The pandemic continues to impact numerous aspects of our business, and the long-term impact remains unknown due to uncertainties such as the severity of the disease and the likelihood of resurgences. Continued business disruption may require significant actions to mitigate the impact, including employee furloughs and reductions in store hours. If customer demand reverts to pre-pandemic levels, we may be unable to react quickly and effectively to such changes. The pandemic and related economic uncertainty may result in prolonged disruption and volatility, magnifying risks associated with sourcing quality merchandise, adjusting inventory levels, and hiring qualified employees. Our ability to grow depends on new store openings and effective utilization of our supply chain, which requires timely responses to customer needs and market demands. We have made significant investments in our supply chain to improve our operational flexibility and meet consumer product needs. Business interruptions from various factors, including global health epidemics and natural disasters, may negatively impact our operations and sales. We believe our brand value is significantly tied to our reputation for safety and high product quality, and any negative publicity could damage our reputation and reduce demand for our merchandise. We rely heavily on our information technology systems for key business processes, and any failure or interruption could adversely impact our operations. We undertake cyber-security planning and activities throughout the company, but the evolving nature of cyber threats presents ongoing challenges. Our ability to manage our workforce effectively is critical, as we depend on hiring, training, and retaining qualified employees to maintain our customer service standards. The competitive landscape requires us to continuously assess and adjust our strategies to address changes in the marketplace. We must also comply with numerous laws and regulations, and any failure to do so could result in governmental enforcement actions or litigation, adversely affecting our financial condition. Our business is influenced by macroeconomic factors, including job growth, inflation, and energy prices, which can impact consumer spending and demand for our products. The aging vehicle population is expected to increase demand for our products, as older vehicles typically require more maintenance. We continue to invest in our business to support long-term growth initiatives, including store expansions and supply chain improvements, while managing our debt levels to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing operational management and resilience to navigate complex situations and external pressures, ensuring we can adapt and respond effectively to future challenges.

The company's business, results of operations, and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has prompted unprecedented measures, including restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine orders. These disruptions have significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in financial markets. The company has experienced disruptions in its supply chain, resulting in shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on factors outside the company's control, including the trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments. The company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations of relevant authorities, demonstrating its commitment to operational continuity and adaptability under challenging conditions. 

The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect its business. Factors such as inflation, slower growth, recession, and changes in fiscal and monetary policy can impact demand for the company's products and services. The company faces risks from political events, trade disputes, and natural disasters that can disrupt international commerce and the global economy. The company has a large global business and believes it generally benefits from growth in international trade, although trade disputes can lead to tariffs and other measures that restrict trade and adversely affect its operations. 

The company relies on outsourcing partners for manufacturing and logistical services, which can reduce direct control over production and distribution. Disruptions in these locations can adversely affect the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, impacting the company's operational flexibility. The company has invested in manufacturing processes and made prepayments to suppliers to ensure the supply of components, but reliance on single or limited sources for critical components exposes the company to significant supply and pricing risks. 

The company's business is subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions, which can adversely impact operations and require substantial recovery time. The company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access, but these measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities. 

Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt ongoing operations and present unforeseen risks. The company has faced significant competition in highly volatile markets, necessitating continuous innovation and adaptation to maintain a competitive advantage. The company's future performance depends on its ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations, highlighting the importance of resilience strategies and mechanisms in navigating complex situations and ensuring organizational survival.

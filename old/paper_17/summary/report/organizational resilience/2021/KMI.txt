The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, resulting in significant disruption of global supply chains and a decline in economic activity. As the pandemic and responses to it continue, we may experience further disruptions to commodities markets, supply chains, and the health, availability, and efficiency of our workforce, which could limit our ability to execute on our business plan. Adverse impacts from the pandemic may heighten many of the other risks we face, including competition from other pipelines and terminals, which could impair our ability to secure new project opportunities and maintain existing contracts. The volatility of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas prices could adversely affect our business segments, and sharp declines in prices may result in a reduction in revenues, income, and cash flows. We utilize hedging arrangements to partially mitigate our exposure to commodity prices, but these arrangements are subject to inherent risks and do not eliminate our exposure. Our operations are also subject to numerous risks, including accidents, natural disasters, and operational disruptions, which could result in significant damage to property and natural resources, environmental pollution, and reputational damage. The occurrence of any operational incident could result in substantial financial losses, including lost revenue and cash flow. We face competition for the supply of the products we handle, and unfavorable economic and market conditions could materially adversely affect our operating results. Our business, financial condition, and operating results may be affected adversely by increased costs of capital or a reduction in the availability of credit, which could limit our ability to pursue acquisition or expansion opportunities. We are also subject to reputational risks and risks relating to public opinion, which can negatively impact our operations and financial condition. The future success of our operations depends in part upon our ability to develop additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable, and our ability to retain and recruit a skilled workforce is critical to implementing our business plans. Difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees could negatively impact our operations, particularly as many current employees are retirement eligible and possess significant institutional knowledge. Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. We are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to pipeline safety and integrity, and compliance with these regulations may require significant capital and operating expense outlays. Climate-related risks and regulations could result in significantly increased operating and capital costs and could reduce demand for our products and services. Additionally, we may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage for our assets in areas subject to severe weather, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and liquidity. The unprecedented responses by governments and other authorities to control and contain the disease have caused significant disruptions, created new risks, and exacerbated existing risks to our business. We have been negatively impacted by the pandemic, including impacts from actions taken in response to the outbreak and the occurrence and spread of related variants. The extent, duration, and magnitude of the pandemic's effect on the economy and consumer demand for cruising and travel are evolving and difficult to predict, potentially persisting for an extended period or becoming more pronounced. We have taken actions to monitor and mitigate changes in our supply chain and port destination availability, which may strain relationships with our vendors and port partners. Our operations may be negatively impacted if we are unable to satisfy the safety standards applicable to our sailings, exposing us to reputational and legal risks. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic makes it difficult to predict the impact of further disruptions and their magnitude. Our previous suspension of sailings and gradual resumption of operations has led to a significant decline in revenues and cash inflows, requiring cost and capital expenditure containment actions. We have reduced and furloughed a portion of our workforce, impacting our ability to rebuild our workforce and delaying our phased resumption of operations. Additionally, we have reduced our planned capital spending, which may negatively impact or delay our execution of planned growth strategies, particularly regarding investments in our ships and technology. The pandemic has also elevated risks affecting significant parts of our business, including operational challenges due to new and evolving protocols and uncertainties regarding the specifics, timing, and costs of implementing health and safety measures. Our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control, and we may be unable to repay or repurchase debt at maturity. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures. The suspension of operations has strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity, leading to actions resulting in reductions in operating expenses, capital expenditures, and liquidity actions. We have taken significant actions to improve our liquidity, including reducing capital expenditures and operating expenses, amending credit agreements to defer payments, and raising capital through debt and stock issuances. Our ability to comply with financial covenants and maintain liquidity is subject to various risks, including the potential need for additional financing and the impact of ongoing economic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant impairments related to our long-lived assets and goodwill, and we continue to evaluate our asset values in light of the ongoing challenges. Our operational flexibility is critical as we navigate these disruptions, and we remain focused on managing costs, improving our balance sheet, and preserving liquidity while preparing for a gradual return to service.

Howmet's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors, including the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in increased operational challenges, including manufacturing site shutdowns and workplace disruptions. The company has faced challenges in restoring production levels due to potential disruptions in its supply chain and the ability to reinstate its workforce. The ongoing pandemic may negatively impact customer contract negotiations and result in lower demand for products, driven by reduced air travel and production rate reductions from aerospace customers. Howmet's operations are influenced by cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions, particularly in the aerospace and commercial transportation industries, which are sensitive to demand changes driven by external pressures such as economic downturns and geopolitical factors. The company is subject to risks arising from the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls in certain countries, which may limit its ability to fund operations effectively. Howmet maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and focuses on actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs. The company has also aligned its operations to enhance operational performance through strategic initiatives aimed at margin enhancement and profitable revenue generation. The continuity of key personnel and preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the company's growth and business strategy, as the loss of key members of management could deplete the company's institutional knowledge base and impede the execution of business plans. Howmet's global operations expose it to risks that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations, including compliance with various laws and regulations, which can increase operational costs and impact its competitive position. The company is committed to maintaining its operational flexibility and adaptability in response to market demands and external pressures. Howmet's focus on capital efficiency and strategic response mechanisms aims to mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions and operational challenges. The company recognizes the importance of fostering inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement to enhance resilience strategies and mechanisms that support recovery and performance maintenance under pressure.

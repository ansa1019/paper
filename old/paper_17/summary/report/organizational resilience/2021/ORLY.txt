Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the ongoing occurrence of COVID-19, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The pandemic has created significant uncertainty, economic disruption, and volatility, impacting our business and requiring us to take significant actions to mitigate adverse impacts. We are unable to predict the ongoing short-term and long-term impact of the pandemic on our customers, team members, supply chain, and overall industry demand due to several factors beyond our control. Economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit, and cause our customers to suffer financial hardship, all of which could negatively affect our business. Our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers, which is influenced by general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, and other factors that influence consumer confidence and spending. If unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business could be adversely affected. Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, which could impact our costs and sales. Weather events and natural disasters may result in business interruptions that affect our ability to deliver inventory and provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or potential loss of customer loyalty. We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory and process transactions, and any damage or interruption could negatively impact our revenue and operations. Our ability to operate effectively and grow in international markets may be impacted by unique risks and challenges, including local laws, political conditions, and compliance with regulations. We believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve and leverage the value of our brand, as negative publicity or failure to comply with standards could jeopardize our reputation. The ongoing challenges from the pandemic have led us to emphasize the safety and wellness of our team members and customers while keeping our stores open to meet critical needs. We cannot predict how long the current crisis will last or the extent of its future impacts. Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, and maintain existing operations, which may be affected by decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns. We expect to fund our cash and capital requirements primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings, but there is no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at recent levels. Our material contractual cash obligations include commitments for debt arrangements, capital expenditures, and operational priorities, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to our success, and unexpected loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our operations. We continue to focus on our dual market strategy and the core values of hard work and customer service to gain market share and grow our business. The strength of our distribution network and supplier relationships has allowed us to maintain better inventory positions than the broader market, contributing to our sales growth despite global supply chain disruptions.

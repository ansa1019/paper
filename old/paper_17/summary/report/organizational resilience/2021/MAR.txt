We are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The impact of COVID-19 has been complex and evolving, resulting in significant disruptions that challenge our operational flexibility and ability to maintain performance under pressure. COVID-19 has dramatically reduced travel demand, adversely affecting our revenues and operational continuity across managed and franchised hotels. The extent of COVID-19's impact on our business will depend on numerous evolving factors, including the recovery of travel demand and the ability to adapt to new market conditions. Our industry is highly competitive, which may impact our ability to respond effectively to external pressures and maintain our competitive advantage. We have seen an increase in disagreements with hotel owners and franchisees, which may hinder our ability to implement strategic initiatives and maintain positive relations essential for organizational resilience. The nature of our responsibilities under management agreements may lead to operational challenges that could affect our organizational health and effectiveness. We are focused on managing our corporate general and administrative costs and are being disciplined with respect to our capital expenditures to preserve financial flexibility. The ongoing recovery in lodging demand has resulted in higher revenues, which is critical for sustaining our operational capabilities. We continue to evaluate the availability of stimulus tax credits and other financial support to mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19. Our growth strategy depends upon attracting third-party owners and franchisees, and we must navigate the complexities of the competitive landscape to ensure successful resource allocation. We are also exposed to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations, which could increase our costs and limit our growth potential. The physical effects of climate change and sustainability-related concerns pose additional risks that could adversely affect our business and operational resilience. Our ability to manage these risks effectively is crucial for maintaining our organizational strength and ensuring long-term survival. We have implemented enhanced security measures to safeguard our systems and data, recognizing that disruptions could lead to significant operational inefficiencies. The impact of cybersecurity incidents could magnify the severity of adverse effects on our business, emphasizing the need for robust risk management strategies. Our reliance on technology and the need for continuous adaptation to changing market conditions are essential for sustaining our operational performance. We continue to assess the implications of COVID-19 on our business and may implement additional measures to adapt our operations to ensure resilience in the face of adversity. The overall operational and financial impact remains fluid, and our ability to foresee and confront challenges will be critical for our future success.

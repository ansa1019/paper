Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including economic slowdowns and decreases in general economic activity that could adversely affect our revenues and operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses, impacting customer demand for equipment rentals and reducing the availability and productivity of our employees. We initiated contingency planning ahead of the impact of COVID-19 on our end-markets, which focused on ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and customers, leveraging competitive advantages to support customer needs, aggressively managing capital expenditures, controlling core operating expenses, and proactively managing the balance sheet with a focus on liquidity. This response plan helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our results. We have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion, and operational efficiencies, which includes a continued focus on "lean" management techniques aimed at continuous improvement. We believe that our size provides us with competitive advantages, including greater purchasing power and the ability to provide a broader range of equipment and services, which enhances our operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures. Our strategic initiatives include the pursuit of acquisitions to expand our core equipment rental business, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and adapting to changing market conditions. We also recognize the importance of maintaining relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies on acceptable terms, as disruptions in our supply chain could significantly impact our ability to meet customer demand. The operational and cost reduction strategies we have implemented may not generate the expected improvements and efficiencies, as their success depends on various factors beyond our control. We are continuously developing and enhancing our controls and processes to protect our systems from cyber threats, which have increased during the pandemic due to remote work. Our operational management strategies are designed to address potential labor shortages and improve servicing capabilities, which are critical for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. The cyclical nature of our business exposes us to fluctuations in demand, which can impact our financial performance and necessitate adjustments in our operational strategies. We have also invested in programs to mitigate the risk of natural disasters, which could disrupt our ability to serve customers. Our ability to adapt to these challenges and maintain operational continuity is vital for our organizational resilience, ensuring that we can confront unexpected situations and recover from adversity effectively.

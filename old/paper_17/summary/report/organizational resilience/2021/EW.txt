Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty, and we are actively managing a portfolio of research and development products while exploring potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted nearly all aspects of our business, including our workforce and operations, and we have prioritized maintaining access to our technologies while supporting our clinician partners. We are proactively managing inventory, assessing alternative logistics options, and closely monitoring the supply of components to adapt to these disruptions. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Our continued growth and success depend on our ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products in a timely manner, as failure to do so could have a material effect on our prospects. We face substantial competition and must demonstrate the full value of our differentiated products to healthcare providers and payors to maintain our competitive position. Our operational flexibility is critical as we navigate the challenges posed by public health threats and the need for effective crisis management. We rely on third parties for the design, manufacture, and sterilization of our products, and any failure or loss of a vendor could result in delays and increased costs, adversely affecting our business. The operation of our business depends on our information technology systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various risks, including cyber-based attacks. Our ability to recruit and retain qualified management and personnel is essential for maintaining operational continuity and effectiveness. We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our business practices, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. The medical technology industry is highly competitive, and our success is measured by our ability to develop innovative products and provide value to stakeholders. We are committed to defending our intellectual property and investing in research and development to transform care. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, our dedicated teams found creative ways to support physicians and keep clinical trials on track. We are closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business and geographies, including its effects on customers, employees, suppliers, and distribution channels. Our financial condition and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected even after the pandemic subsides. We are dedicated to generating robust clinical, economic, and quality-of-life evidence to encourage the adoption of innovative new medical therapies. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs is vital for our organizational resilience and long-term success. We are committed to developing new technologies and providing innovative patient care while managing the risks associated with our global operations.

The covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected our global business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The pandemic has caused significant societal disruption and has had adverse economic impacts on our business, including volatility in capital markets, disruptions in the labor market, supply chain disruption, and increased mortality compared to pricing expectations. We have implemented work-from-home business continuity plans for non-essential staff globally, and our offices are open to fully vaccinated employees with strict protocols in place. The extended remote work environment has put stress on our business continuity plans and may prove them to be less effective than expected. Our insurance businesses have experienced increased claim volume under our life and retirement insurance products, and we have made changes to underwriting guidelines or product design in response to the ongoing adverse economic impacts. The economic impacts of the pandemic may result in policyholders canceling or not renewing insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have established a risk management framework to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks, including those arising from operational disruptions. Our enterprise risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks. The successful implementation of our operational programs, such as aig 200, is critical to achieving anticipated improvements in our businesses. Our restructuring initiatives may not yield expected reductions in expenses and improvements in operational efficiency. The management of our investment portfolio is essential to support our insurance liabilities and ensure adequate liquidity. We actively monitor and manage our exposure to interest rate risk, credit risk, and market volatility. Our investment strategies are designed to align with the cash flow needs of our insurance operations, and we seek to diversify our portfolio to mitigate risks. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by our general insurance companies. We continuously evaluate our assumptions and methodologies to ensure they remain appropriate. Our insurance risk management framework includes underwriting approval processes, pricing approval processes, and the use of actuarial analysis to help determine the adequacy of provisions for insurance. We also utilize reinsurance to limit our losses and manage exposure to catastrophic events. The effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses due to market stress or unanticipated claims experience. The emergence of significant adverse experience compared to expectations could require adjustments to benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs, impacting our financial results. We are committed to maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of ongoing challenges, including the evolving nature of the pandemic and its effects on our business operations and financial performance.

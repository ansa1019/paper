The company is pursuing a plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies, which may not achieve the intended benefits and could distract management from other tasks in operating the business. The business is sensitive to general economic conditions, and slower global economic growth may adversely affect the company and its distributors, customers, and suppliers. The company has implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across its businesses to adjust its cost structure, which could slow improvements in products and services and limit the ability to respond to customers. The growth of the company depends in part on the growth of the markets it serves, and visibility into these markets is limited, particularly for those sold through distribution. The company faces intense competition and must retain longstanding relationships with major customers while developing new products and services to maintain and expand its market position. The company's success depends on its ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences, allocate research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects, and successfully commercialize new technologies. The company is also subject to various regulations that could adversely affect its reputation and financial statements. Compliance with these regulations may require significant expenses and could impact the company's operational flexibility. The company’s operations, products, and services expose it to environmental, health, and safety liabilities that could adversely affect its reputation. The company relies on its suppliers to adhere to standards of conduct, and material violations could have a material effect on its financial statements. The company continually assesses the strategic fit of its existing businesses and may divest those that do not fit with its strategic plan. The company’s ability to grow revenues and cash flow depends on its ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses. The company may face challenges in consummating acquisitions at appropriate prices, which could adversely impact its growth rate. The company’s restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on its business, and any delays in implementing planned restructuring activities may diminish the operational or financial benefits expected from such actions. The company is exposed to various risks, including changes in governmental regulations, which may reduce demand for its products or services or increase expenses. The company’s financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities used in its operations, and any sustained interruption in supply could adversely affect its business. The company’s reliance on sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials could cause production interruptions and inefficiencies. The company’s operations are subject to catastrophic loss due to various events, and significant disruptions could harm its operations and result in legal exposure. The company’s information technology systems are critical to its operations, and any significant disruption could adversely affect its business. The company believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs and plans to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these requirements. The company’s defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its financial statements. The company’s ability to maintain its competitive advantage and operational continuity depends on its strategic initiatives and the effective management of its resources.

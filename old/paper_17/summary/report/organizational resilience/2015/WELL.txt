This section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations, and financial condition. We are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our seniors housing operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, economic conditions, competition, and regulatory compliance. Our proactive and comprehensive asset management process includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, which supports both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment. We monitor our investments through various methods determined by the type of property, and when we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate, or transfer the risk. Our ability to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We depend on Genesis Healthcare, LLC for a significant portion of our revenues, and any inability or unwillingness by Genesis to satisfy its obligations could adversely affect us. Our operators' revenues are primarily driven by occupancy and reimbursement rates, and any decrease in revenues could affect their ability to make payments to us. We are exposed to the risk that our obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal, and interest or other payments due, which may result in an obligor bankruptcy or insolvency. Our investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments, and disputes with partners could require us to expend additional resources. We cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases, which could require us to find other tenants or sell properties. The dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services could have a material adverse effect on our obligors' liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. We are subject to various federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification, and inspection laws, and failure to comply could adversely affect our operators' ability to meet their obligations. Our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases. We may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters, which could result in increased costs or a significant loss of capital invested in a property. Our business is at risk from cybersecurity attacks, which could disrupt our operations and compromise confidential information. We have experienced rapid growth and development, which has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for our management. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. We continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments, and our access to capital depends on various factors, including market conditions and the financial stability of our lenders. Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed, and losing key personnel could have an adverse impact on our operations. We monitor economic and other factors to develop strategic plans, and our ability to respond to emerging trends is critical for maintaining organizational resilience.

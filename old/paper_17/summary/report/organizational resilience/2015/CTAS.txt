The statements in this section describe the most significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, including the successful completion of the sale of Cintas' investment in the Shred-it partnership, which may divert management's attention from business operations. Unexpected events, including natural disasters and supply disruptions, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, and disruptions in the availability of these systems could impact our ability to service customers. Our businesses rely on our computer systems to provide customer information and process transactions, and we have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested. However, our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption due to catastrophic events and usage errors, which could lead to production downtimes and operational delays. The unpredictability of such disruptions could adversely affect our sales and require significant investments to rectify. We continue to evaluate opportunities for acquiring businesses that may supplement our internal growth, and the success of any acquisition depends on our ability to integrate the acquired company, which may involve unforeseen difficulties. The integration process may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and resources, and the failure to successfully integrate these businesses could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. We assess our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment when required, and deterioration in economic conditions may result in declining revenue, which can lead to excess capacity and declining operating cash flow. Our ability to open new operating facilities is necessary for expansion, and any inability to effectively identify and manage the opening of these facilities may adversely affect our financial performance. We may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining competent personnel in key positions, which could adversely affect our businesses. The competitive landscape in which we operate is highly dynamic, and increases in labor costs and material costs could adversely affect our financial performance. Negative economic conditions may also adversely affect the demand for our products and services. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures to comply with complex state and federal regulations, and any failure to comply could result in substantial fines or revocation of our authority to conduct operations. Our corporate culture, which is a key component of our success, relies on our ability to attract and retain key employees. The risks and uncertainties described herein are not exhaustive, and additional risks may also harm our business. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and operations, but the unpredictability of the timing, nature, and scope of disruptions could impact our operational continuity.

Investing in AIG involves risk, and various risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, potentially exacerbating their effects. Our businesses are highly dependent on the economic environment, both in the U.S. and globally, and extreme market events can lead to a lack of liquidity, volatile markets, and erosion of investor confidence. Difficult economic conditions could result in reduced demand for our products and increased policy cancellations, lapses, or surrenders. We manage these concentration risks by monitoring the accumulation of our exposures and utilizing reinsurance, hedging, and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures that exceed our desired retention limits. Our ability to sell assets may be limited, and adverse experience compared to our expectations could materially affect our results of operations. We recognize that climate change poses a serious financial threat, with implications for the insurance industry in areas such as catastrophe risk perception and pricing. Catastrophic events, whether natural or man-made, could expose us to widespread claim costs, loss of invested assets, and significant interruptions to our systems and operations. Our exposure to catastrophes depends on various factors, including the frequency and severity of such events. We use reinsurance as part of our overall risk management strategy, but market conditions may limit our ability to obtain adequate reinsurance or may require us to incur additional expenses. AIG parentâ€™s ability to access funds from subsidiaries is limited, and our internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt, and to meet statutory capital requirements. If our liquidity is insufficient, we may need to seek third-party financing, which may not be available or could be prohibitively expensive. Our liquidity risk framework is designed to manage liquidity at both AIG parent and subsidiaries to meet obligations over a twelve-month period under a liquidity stress scenario. We have established minimum liquidity requirements that protect our long-term viability and ability to fund our ongoing business. Our risk management framework includes a number of liquidity and funding policies to address broader industry and market-related liquidity events. We also monitor our foreign currency exposures against single currency and aggregate currency portfolio limits. Our risk appetite framework integrates stakeholder interests, strategic business goals, and available financial resources. We conduct risk identification through various processes to capture our material risks and key areas of focus for follow-up risk management actions. Our enterprise risk management framework supports the identification, assessment, and management of risks across the organization, with a focus on optimizing returns while maintaining adequate capital and liquidity. The governance structure fosters a risk and control culture that encompasses all significant risk categories, ensuring that risk management is an integral part of managing our core businesses. We continuously evaluate our risk management practices to ensure they effectively address the evolving risk landscape and support our strategic objectives.

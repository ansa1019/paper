The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, deflation, and changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns may adversely affect consumer demand for our merchandise, especially in countries with lower average incomes than the U.S. The occurrence of natural disasters, changes in climate, and geopolitical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance, resulting in physical damage to our properties, disruption in the supply of products, and changes in consumer purchasing patterns. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is highly competitive, and our segments compete for customers, employees, and products with many other retailers and wholesale club operators. Our ability to identify consumer trends and preferences is critical, and failure to respond effectively could negatively affect our relationship with customers and market share. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions and manage our business, and disruptions in these systems could harm our operations. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and any breach of our security measures could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial performance. Our ability to attract and retain qualified associates is essential for operational continuity, and increases in wage and benefit costs could adversely affect our financial performance. Impediments to our expansion of physical retail in the U.S. may materially adversely affect our financial performance, as our ability to open new stores depends on various external factors. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with political conditions, economic instability, and compliance with local laws, which could adversely affect our financial performance. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes requires judgment and estimation, and changes in tax laws or regulations could materially affect our financial performance. We are involved in legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our ongoing investigation into compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act may expose us to penalties and other adverse consequences. Our ability to manage these risks effectively is crucial for maintaining organizational resilience and ensuring operational flexibility in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

The healthcare industry in the United States has changed significantly in an effort to enhance efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes. These changes have included cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, shifts towards value-based payments, and the consolidation of pharmaceutical distributors. We expect the healthcare industry to continue evolving, which may impact our operational flexibility and adaptability. Our business operations could be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. The majority of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements are structured to ensure appropriate compensation for services provided, but failure to renew these contracts in a timely manner could adversely affect our results. The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation could impose increased costs and negatively impact our profit margins. We are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, which could expose us to litigation and regulatory investigations. Our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject us to laws that prohibit certain practices, and failure to comply could result in civil and criminal penalties. The Affordable Care Act has significantly changed how healthcare is financed, and while we do not anticipate a material impact on our financial position, the uncertainties associated with these reforms could affect our operations. We have developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on our operations, but there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective. Our business relies on secure electronic transmission and storage of sensitive information, and a failure or compromise of our systems could result in operational and financial consequences. We maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely upon third-party providers, and any failure of these vendors could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our contractual commitments. Our ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted if we experience difficulties with outsourcing and managing third-party relationships. We regularly evaluate our portfolio to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives, and divestitures may involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, which could adversely affect our results. We are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations, and the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable. Our distribution solutions segment faces a highly competitive global environment, and competition may erode our profit margins. A material reduction in purchases or the loss of a large customer could adversely impact our financial position. We are also subject to risks associated with our foreign operations, including changes in trade protection laws and unexpected regulatory changes. Our future results could be materially affected by public health issues, which could disrupt our operations and those of our suppliers or customers. We continuously monitor outstanding receivables and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt, and our sales and credit concentration is significant. The occurrence of any adverse changes in general economic conditions could materially reduce our revenue growth and profitability.

Our business is subject to a variety of risks, including environmental disruptions and external pressures that could adversely affect our sales, cash flows, and overall financial condition. We believe that our ability to respond effectively to these challenges is critical for maintaining operational continuity and organizational resilience. Our competitive advantage relies on our capacity to adapt to changing market conditions, including fluctuations in demand for our products due to economic factors such as rising energy prices and the age of vehicles in service. We continuously evaluate customer buying trends and market needs, which informs our strategic initiatives for opening new locations and expanding our product offerings. Our operational flexibility is enhanced by our investments in supply chain infrastructure and logistics management, which are essential for maintaining optimal inventory levels and meeting customer demands during periods of increased strain.

We face challenges from competitors who may gain advantages through greater financial resources, which could affect our market share. The consolidation among competitors may also impact our ability to maintain competitive pricing and customer loyalty. Therefore, we must continuously assess our strategic response and resource allocation to mitigate risks associated with market volatility and ensure our long-term success.

Our financial performance is closely tied to macroeconomic conditions, and we are aware that external disturbances could have material adverse effects on our operations. We actively monitor our credit ratings and financial ratios to maintain access to necessary funding, which is crucial for supporting our growth initiatives and managing operational risks.

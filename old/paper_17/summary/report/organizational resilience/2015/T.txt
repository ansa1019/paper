The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: adverse economic and/or capital access changes in the markets served by us or in countries in which we have significant investments, including the impact on customer demand and our ability and our suppliers' ability to access financial markets at favorable rates and terms; our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies or delivery methods; the extent of competition including from governmental networks and other providers and the resulting pressure on customer and access line totals and segment operating margins; our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition; and changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs. Additionally, our ability to manage growth in wireless data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms, is critical for maintaining operational flexibility. The impact on our networks from major equipment failures, security breaches, or severe weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, energy shortages, wars, or terrorist attacks could also significantly affect our organizational resilience. Our ability to integrate our acquisition of DirectTV and adequately fund our wireless operations, including payment for additional spectrum and network upgrades, is essential for sustaining performance under pressure. The uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions may result in a significant reduction in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general and on our products and services specifically, due to this fiscal uncertainty. The final outcome of FCC and other federal or state agency proceedings involving issues that are important to our business, including the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, is also a critical factor in our ability to adapt to environmental disruptions. Our ability to attract and offer a diverse portfolio of wireless service and devices, maintain margins, and the availability and cost of additional wireless spectrum are vital for our strategic response to competitive pressures. Furthermore, the outcome of pending, threatened, or potential litigation, including patent and product safety claims, may impact our organizational capabilities and resilience strategies. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is paramount for our survival and growth in a turbulent market. The enactment of additional state, federal, and/or foreign regulatory and tax laws and regulations pertaining to our subsidiaries and foreign investments could reduce our incentive to invest in our networks, resulting in lower revenue growth and/or higher operating costs, thereby affecting our organizational health.

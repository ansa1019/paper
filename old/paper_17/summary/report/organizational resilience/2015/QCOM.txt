The risks and uncertainties described in this annual report are not the only ones we face, as additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also impair our business operations. Our revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions, and upgrades of communications technologies, which are influenced by the ability to drive customer demand for our products and services. Our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change, which could result in decreased demand and declining average selling prices for our products. The competitive landscape is affected by various factors, including device manufacturer concentrations, growth in emerging geographic regions, and evolving industry standards. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their offerings or reduce prices, which could pressure our product pricing. Our future success will depend on our ability to differentiate our products with innovative technologies and to drive the adoption of our integrated circuit products across a broad spectrum of devices. We must continue to innovate and introduce products that differentiate us from our competition and maintain demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier. Our revenues and growth may be negatively impacted if wireless operators deploy alternative technologies or delay network upgrades. The concentration of device share among a few companies may reduce average selling prices for our products, and the timing and size of purchases by significant customers may fluctuate, impacting our revenues. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and any decrease in revenues from these customers could harm our operating results. Our licensing revenues are also impacted by the ability of our licensees to develop and deliver high-volume products that achieve customer acceptance. We are subject to various legal proceedings and governmental investigations that could adversely affect our business. Our business may suffer from new or changed laws, regulations, or policies, and we must comply with various laws and regulations globally. Our research and development investments may not generate the expected operating income, and we must make substantial investments in new products and technologies to compete successfully. We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement and manufacture of our products, and any disruptions in supply could negatively impact our business. Our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to changing market conditions is critical for our resilience. The future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend on the ability of our licensees to meet their reporting and payment requirements. We continue to invest significant resources in research and development to support our business and adapt to emerging technologies and market demands. Our strategic realignment plan aims to improve execution, enhance financial performance, and drive profitable growth, although we cannot assure its success. The ongoing evolution of our business model and the competitive landscape will require us to remain agile and responsive to external pressures and opportunities.

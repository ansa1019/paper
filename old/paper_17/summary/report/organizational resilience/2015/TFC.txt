The ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and its related rulemaking activities may result in lower revenues, higher costs, and ratings downgrades, which could adversely affect BB&T's business and profitability. BB&T is subject to extensive and expanding government regulation and supervision, which can lead to costly enforcement actions while increasing the cost of doing business and limiting BB&T's ability to generate revenue. The financial services industry is facing more intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and compliance matters. BB&T's banking operations are locally oriented and community-based, and the company expects to continue to be dependent upon local business conditions. Changes in national, regional, and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offs and reduce BB&T's net income and growth. BB&T's business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on economic conditions, which may have a material adverse impact on its operations and financial condition. The company faces significant operational and other risks related to its activities, which could expose it to negative publicity, litigation, and regulatory action. BB&T's risk management framework establishes an environment that enables it to achieve superior performance relative to peers and ensures that BB&T is viewed among the safest of banks. The company has established a risk management framework based on a "three lines of defense" model, which includes business units identifying, assessing, controlling, and reporting their group's risk profile. The risk management oversight is provided by the Risk Management Office (RMO), which aggregates and correlates risk information into a holistic picture of the corporation's risk profile. BB&T's risk culture encourages transparency and open dialogue between all levels in the organization, promoting predictable and consistent performance. BB&T has contingency funding plans designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. The plans provide a framework for management to follow in anticipation of such an event and address authority for activation and decision-making. BB&T maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unpledged securities to ensure a strong liquidity position. The company’s liquidity risk is monitored through various metrics, including funding concentrations, diversification, maturity distribution, and contingent funding needs. BB&T’s capital management processes ensure sufficient capital is maintained to absorb losses and instill confidence in the bank. The company regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to submit capital plans to banking regulators. BB&T's strategic objectives are subject to many uncertainties and challenges, including intense competition within the financial services industry, evolving consumer preferences, and global economic risks. The achievement of BB&T's key strategic objectives is influenced by the current financial condition and performance of the company and its expectations for future economic activity. The company’s risk management framework is designed to ensure that risks are understood and can be managed effectively, allowing BB&T to maintain operational flexibility and adapt to changing market conditions.

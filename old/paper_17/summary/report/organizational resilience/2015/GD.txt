An investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties, including those that apply specifically to our business. Our revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government, which involves specific risks related to funding levels driven by threats to national security and competing demands for federal funds. Decreases in U.S. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated, impacting our financial performance. U.S. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and funding is subject to disruption or delay, which can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content. Our contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer, and the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings. We face various cyber security threats, including attempts to gain access to proprietary or classified information, which could challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive systems and impact our results of operations materially. Our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet customer needs. Changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired, and we face uncertainty in our business environment due to various challenges, including changes in defense spending. Our financial performance is impacted by U.S. government spending levels, particularly defense spending, which has been reduced in recent years. The long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is influenced by the relevance of our programs to military funding priorities, our ability to evolve products to address a fast-changing threat environment, and our proven track record of successful contract execution. We continue to focus on improving operating earnings, expanding margins, and efficiently converting earnings into cash while anticipating trends and reacting to changing circumstances in our business environment. Our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if suppliers are unable to provide agreed-upon supplies or services. We manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues and disruptions. Our non-U.S. business may be sensitive to changes in foreign government budgets and national priorities, which may occur suddenly. We have made and expect to continue making investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. The anticipated benefits from these transactions depend on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved and market conditions following the acquisition. We emphasize effective program execution and drive cost-reduction activities across our business. Our operational flexibility and adaptability are critical in navigating the current business environment, and we continue to pursue international opportunities while managing the risks associated with changing budget priorities and overall spending pressures unique to each country. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy, which is essential for maintaining organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and uncertainties.

Our business is subject to various industry, economic, regulatory, and other risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The competitive pressures in the pharmacy benefit management (PBM) industry have resulted in clients sharing a larger portion of rebates and discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers, which may impact our profitability. We face challenges in maintaining contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and any loss of these relationships could adversely affect our business. The health care industry is experiencing significant regulatory changes that may require extensive system and operational adjustments, which could be difficult to implement. Changes in laws and regulations may also impact our ability to offer competitive pricing and could negatively affect our profitability. The competitive success of our retail pharmacy and long-term care (LTC) pharmacy businesses is dependent on our ability to adapt to the evolving health care environment and establish and maintain relationships with payors. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform our operations is critical for maintaining our competitive advantage. The introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceuticals, as well as lower-priced generic alternatives, significantly affects our business profitability. We rely heavily on our information systems to manage operations, and any failure or disruption of these systems could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions. Our operations are also dependent on the secure transmission of confidential information, and any compromise of our information security controls could adversely affect our business. The ability to effectively integrate acquired companies is crucial for realizing anticipated benefits and growth opportunities. We face risks related to payment processing, including potential fraud and theft, which could disrupt our business operations. The economic environment, including changes in consumer purchasing power and preferences, may affect demand for our services and products. Our business is also impacted by the frequency and rate of introduction of generic drugs and brand name prescription products. We must continually adapt to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements to maintain customer loyalty. The health of our organization is influenced by our ability to manage operational resources effectively and respond to competitive pressures. Our business operations are subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our operations. The potential for litigation and regulatory scrutiny remains a significant risk that could impact our financial condition and operational practices. We must also navigate the complexities of market availability and supplier relationships to ensure continuity in our operations. Overall, our ability to maintain operational flexibility, adapt to external pressures, and effectively manage risks is essential for sustaining our organizational resilience in a highly competitive and regulated environment.

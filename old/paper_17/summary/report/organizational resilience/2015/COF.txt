This section highlights specific risks that could affect our business, including general economic and market risks that may adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations, and financial condition. The macroeconomic environment remains unstable and uneven, and the U.S. economy is susceptible to global events and volatility. Changes in consumer confidence levels and behavior could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our ability to recover debt previously charged-off may be limited, which could negatively impact our results of operations. The process and models used to estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses may become less reliable if actual losses diverge from projections due to changes in customer behavior or volatile economic conditions. Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, which could limit our access to funding. We are subject to heightened regulatory oversight, which may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with existing and new laws and regulations. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control and may change rapidly, potentially influencing our revenue, costs, earnings, growth, liquidity, and capital levels. We face risks related to our operational, technological, and organizational infrastructure, which are critical to our ability to grow and compete. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process, record, and monitor complex transactions, and any failures in our financial or data processing systems could materially adversely affect our business and reputation. We are embedding technology deeply into our business model, which presents both opportunities and risks. Our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk. We employ a risk framework that includes governance processes, accountabilities, and risk appetites established by our board of directors. Our risk management policies and procedures are designed to identify, assess, manage, and control risks, including operational and credit risks. We recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality and strive to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns through sound underwriting practices. The chief risk officer is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and monitoring credit exposure and performance. We continuously monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Our risk framework consists of eight key elements, including the identification and assessment of risks, development of controls, and escalation of key risks to executive management. We aim to maintain adequate liquidity reserves to cover funding requirements and potential deposit run-off, ensuring access to diversified funding sources. Our liquidity management practices are intended to ensure we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand potential impacts from deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in funding markets. We regularly evaluate, update, and enhance our assumptions, models, and analytical tools to reflect the market environment and expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.

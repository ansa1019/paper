Our services may be adversely impacted by changes in government regulations and policies, which could reduce or eliminate the need for some of our services and substantially decrease our revenue. Failure to modify our services in a timely fashion in response to regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We must adapt and respond to technological advances and technological requirements of our clients. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance capabilities and increase the performance of our internal systems. If our systems become outdated, we may be at a disadvantage when competing in our industry. We rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. If we experience a problem with the functioning of key systems or a security breach, the resulting disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our infrastructure against damage from catastrophe or natural disaster. We have a business continuity plan in place, which has been tested in the past by circumstances of severe weather and has been successful. However, these past successes are not an indicator of success in the future. If the business continuity plan is unsuccessful in a disaster recovery scenario, we could potentially lose client data or experience material adverse interruptions to our operations. We may be adversely impacted by any failure of third-party service providers to perform their functions, which could result in material interruptions to our operations and impact client relations. We may be exposed to additional risks related to our co-employment relationship within our PEO business, which may result in increased costs and liabilities. Our insurance costs are impacted by claim experience and are a significant portion of our PEO costs. If we experience a sudden or unexpected increase in claim activity, our costs could increase. We may be adversely impacted by changes in health insurance and workers' compensation rates and underlying claims trends. Our financial position as of May 31, 2015 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $936.4 million and no debt. We believe that our investments will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, business acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. Our strategy focuses on flexible, convenient service; industry-leading, integrated technology; and providing a comprehensive suite of value-added HCM services. We continue to drive growth in clients, revenue, and profits while managing our personnel costs and expenses. Our financial results for fiscal 2015 reflected sustained growth in our business, with payroll service revenue continuing to experience steady growth. We achieved a milestone of $1 billion of HRS revenue for fiscal 2015, driven by strong demand for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing solutions. Our client satisfaction results remained high, which we believe is a result of our focus on providing innovative technology solutions and outstanding personal service to maximize client retention. We continue to strengthen our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients and small businesses. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes. Our investments in technology and service capabilities are critical to our success and will position us to capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth.

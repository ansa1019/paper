In addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those related to catastrophic events and severe weather, which can materially affect our operating results and financial condition. We face exposure to significant losses from catastrophes, including natural and man-made events, and despite our catastrophe management programs, we remain vulnerable to extraordinary losses. Our historical catastrophe experience includes substantial losses from events such as hurricanes and earthquakes, which have impacted our financial condition. The unpredictability of severe weather conditions can lead to increased claim frequency and severity, affecting profitability. We utilize models developed by third-party vendors and our own historic data to assess our property insurance exposure to catastrophe losses; however, these models have limitations in accurately predicting future losses. 

We pursue various loss management initiatives to mitigate future increases in claim severity, but there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully reduce the impact of future claims. Our ability to manage catastrophe risk is further complicated by regulatory environments that can dictate underwriting practices and limit our ability to adjust rates, which may adversely affect our operating results. We are also subject to competitive pressures that can affect our pricing and underwriting strategies, potentially leading to decreased profitability. 

Our sophisticated pricing and underwriting methods have historically allowed us to offer competitive pricing, but as competitors adopt similar strategies, our competitive advantage could diminish. We continuously monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target returns, which could result in the discontinuation or de-emphasis of certain products. Changes in the level of price competition and underwriting standards may adversely affect our operating results. 

We have implemented a catastrophe reinsurance program designed to address our exposure to catastrophic events, which is part of our broader catastrophe management strategy aimed at providing acceptable returns on the risks assumed in our property business while reducing the variability of earnings. We are focused on enhancing our effectiveness and efficiency through processes and standards that elevate the customer experience, which includes investments in technology to improve service delivery and claims handling. 

Our enterprise risk and return management framework provides a comprehensive view of risks and opportunities, guiding strategic and business decisions. We strive to protect solvency, comply with laws, and act with integrity while optimizing risks and returns. Our governance structure includes board oversight and senior management committees that direct risk-return targets and establish strategies from an enterprise perspective. 

We continuously validate and improve our risk management practices, adapting to changes in business and market environments. Our commitment to managing risks associated with catastrophic events, regulatory pressures, and competitive dynamics is essential to maintaining operational resilience and ensuring long-term sustainability in a turbulent market landscape.

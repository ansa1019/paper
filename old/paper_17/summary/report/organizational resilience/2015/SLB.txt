The following discussion of risk factors contains important information for understanding the potential impacts on our business and financial condition. The current significant downturn in the oil and gas industry has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services, which may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and operational flexibility. Demand for our services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which are sensitive to the industry's view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Continued low oil and gas prices could lead to project modifications, delays, or cancellations, and general business disruptions, which could materially affect our operational continuity and resilience. Our non-U.S. operations expose us to various risks, including political, social, and economic volatility, which could impact our ability to maintain performance under pressure. We have implemented internal controls and compliance programs to mitigate risks associated with anti-bribery laws, but any violations could adversely affect our reputation and operational effectiveness. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities may also reduce our earnings and cash available for operations, as we are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations. Our business may be materially affected by severe weather conditions, which could entail the evacuation of personnel and stoppage of services, impacting our ability to adapt and respond effectively to unexpected situations. Cybersecurity risks pose a threat to our information systems, and any breaches could disrupt our business operations and compromise our organizational strength. We continue to focus on what we can control, streamlining and resizing our organization to navigate the current market downturn while maintaining a constructive outlook on the medium-term market. Our financial performance has been significantly impacted by the decrease in land activity, particularly in North America, leading to operational disruptions and pricing pressures. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to resource management and strategic initiatives that enhance our resilience and adaptability in the face of environmental perturbations. The anticipated merger with Cameron is subject to various closing conditions that could materially affect our operations and financial results, and we must successfully integrate both businesses to realize the expected benefits. The success of this merger will depend on our ability to manage the complexities of a larger organization while maintaining focus on providing high-quality products and customer service. Our proactive measures in cost management and resource allocation are essential for sustaining our operational capabilities and ensuring long-term organizational success amidst market volatility and external pressures.

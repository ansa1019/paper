We face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to maintain profitability over the long-term is dependent upon our ability to fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that attract a sufficient number of consumers. The automotive industry will experience more change in the next five years than it has in the previous 50 years, and we must be responsive to the entrance of non-traditional participants who may disrupt the historic business model through new technologies and methods of travel. Our long-term profitability depends upon successfully creating and funding technological innovations in design, engineering, and manufacturing, which requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent. We operate in a highly competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. Our profitability is dependent upon the success of full-size pick-up trucks and SUVs, and any increases in the price of oil could cause a shift in consumer demand towards smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Our business is highly dependent upon the global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile and is sensitive to various economic and market conditions. Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy, and we anticipate that additional competitors will seek to enter this market. We operate a significant amount of our business through joint ventures, which require us to foster relationships with co-owners and promote the overall success of the joint venture. Our operations outside the U.S. expose us to additional risks, including political, economic, and regulatory changes that could affect our ability to operate effectively. We are subject to extensive laws and regulations that could increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio. Meeting or exceeding these regulations is costly and technologically challenging, and the evolving regulatory framework may limit the types of vehicles we sell. We continue to implement operating effectiveness initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs, which are essential for our future competitiveness. Our ability to manage the distribution channels for our products and to successfully restructure our operations in various countries is critical. We must also maintain quality control over our vehicles to avoid material recalls that could harm our reputation and financial position. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and to transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is vital. We rely on information technology networks and systems to manage various business processes, and any disruptions could compromise our operations and customer data. Our future funding requirements depend on the performance of assets placed in trusts for our pension plans, and we must continuously assess our performance and adapt to changing market conditions.

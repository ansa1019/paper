The maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions is critical for organizational resilience. Our financial performance has been supported by improving demand in on-highway markets in North America, while demand in most international markets has been weak, indicating the need for adaptability in response to external pressures. A sustained slowdown in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, highlighting the importance of risk mitigation strategies. We recognize significant sales to a few large truck OEMs in North America, and any downturn in this market could lead to substantial reductions in revenues and earnings, necessitating operational flexibility and effective resource allocation. The unpredictability in the adoption and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards could adversely affect our business, requiring us to develop new products to comply with regulatory requirements, which reflects our commitment to innovation and resilience strategies. We are also vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers, which could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers, emphasizing the need for robust event management and crisis response mechanisms. Our restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives in response to the slowdown in global markets demonstrate our proactive measures to maintain operational continuity and organizational health. The integration of our partially-owned distributors is essential for realizing enhanced revenue and operational benefits, and any delays in this process could negatively impact our performance. Our ability to effectively manage these initiatives will be crucial for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring organizational survival. We face significant competition in the markets we serve, and the need for strategic agility and inter-organizational collaboration is paramount to navigate the complexities of the competitive landscape. Our operations are subject to various risks, including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and political uncertainties, which necessitate a systemic perspective in our strategic planning. The successful development and introduction of new products are essential for compliance with regulatory standards and maintaining our market position. Our organizational practices must focus on knowledge management and the absorption of internal and external knowledge to enhance our adaptability and resilience. The challenges posed by environmental disruptions and market volatility require us to deploy resources effectively and maintain performance under pressure. Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong, providing us with the flexibility needed to confront adversity and support our strategic initiatives. The anticipated savings from restructuring actions will contribute to our resilience, enabling us to align our capacity with demand and drive efficiencies in our business. We are committed to fostering an organizational culture that emphasizes learning and adaptation, which is vital for thriving in turbulent markets.

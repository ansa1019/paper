Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the U.S., which exposes us to challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different regions. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting our ability to make principal and interest payments on debt and affecting our customers' ability to satisfy rental payments. Our business and operations could suffer from system failures or cyber security attacks, which could result in material disruptions. We depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, and any loss of key personnel could adversely affect our performance and competitive position. Deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures may result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements. We pursue growth opportunities in international markets, which may expose us to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate adverse effects through various financial strategies, but there can be no assurance of success. Compliance with regulatory requirements is essential, as noncompliance could result in substantial costs. Our investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business, including local conditions and governmental regulations. We may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flow. We are also subject to risks associated with acquisitions, including potential liabilities and the performance of acquired properties. Our real estate development strategies may not be successful, and we may face delays or increased costs. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually and have chosen to self-insure certain exposures based on industry practices. Our organizational practices involve maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changing market conditions. We recognize the importance of strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance our resilience. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from co-investment ventures, and property dispositions is crucial for meeting our anticipated future requirements. We expect to fund our cash needs through various sources, including property operations and fees earned for services performed on behalf of co-investment ventures. We are committed to maintaining sufficient influence over our co-investment ventures to achieve our business objectives, but we may not be able to do so indefinitely. Our organizational capabilities are tested by external pressures, and we strive to maintain operational continuity and performance under pressure. Our strategic response to environmental disruptions and the need for adaptability are critical for our long-term success. We recognize that our investments are concentrated in specific sectors, which may expose us to economic downturns. Overall, our approach to risk management, resource allocation, and strategic planning is designed to enhance our organizational resilience in the face of adversity.

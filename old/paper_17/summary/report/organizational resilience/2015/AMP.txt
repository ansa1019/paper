Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including market fluctuations, economic, political, and other factors that could materially adversely affect our business. The financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by changes in consumer economic variables, which could affect client activity across all businesses. The ability to achieve strategic objectives may be influenced by declines and volatility in U.S. and global market conditions. Our businesses have been adversely affected by capital market and credit crises, equity market volatility, and economic stress. It is difficult to predict the extent to which adverse conditions may exist and which markets, products, and businesses will be directly affected. The profitability of our products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, which can be reduced by declines in equity markets. Market downturns may cause potential purchasers to limit or refrain from purchasing products, and current shareholders may withdraw cash values from investment products. The impact of a significant equity market decline could result in guaranteed minimum benefits exceeding current account values, adversely affecting our financial condition. Although some hedging strategies are in place, there can be no assurance that they will fully mitigate financial losses. Investment performance is critical to the success of our businesses, and poor performance could impair revenues and earnings. Clients can terminate their relationships with us or reduce managed assets based on various factors, including investment performance and changes in market conditions. The impairment of other financial institutions could adversely affect us, as we are interconnected with various industries and counterparties. The performance and financial strength of specific institutions are subject to rapid change, which could limit access to liquidity or disrupt operations. We are also subject to risks arising from acquisitions and divestitures, including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and retaining customers. Operational failures or interruptions could harm our business, and we rely on third-party service providers for critical functions, exposing us to additional risks. Our risk management policies may not fully mitigate risk exposure in all market environments, and errors or misconduct by employees could harm our business. The establishment of reserves for future policy benefits and claims is inherently uncertain and could require adjustments based on actual experience. Changes in laws and regulations could impact our operations and profitability, and ongoing changes may produce results that cannot be immediately ascertained. We are subject to various legal and regulatory actions, which could result in financial losses or reputational harm. Our reputation is one of our most important assets, and damage to it could arise from various sources, including regulatory actions and compliance failures. We have implemented security measures to protect against cybersecurity risks, but breaches could have a material adverse impact on our business. The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and we cannot predict the timing or impact of such events. Our ability to maintain adequate capital and liquidity is crucial, and we may need to raise additional capital if current resources are insufficient. The operation of our business in foreign markets subjects us to additional risks, including exchange rate fluctuations and regulatory requirements. We continuously assess our exposure to various risks and implement measures to enhance our resilience and adaptability in the face of changing market conditions.

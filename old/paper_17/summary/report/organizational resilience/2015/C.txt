Citi's full year 2015 results reflected a solid overall performance, with net income reaching $17.1 billion, the highest since the pre-financial crisis. During the year, Citi was able to grow revenues by 3% and make investments in its core Citicorp businesses while reducing overall expenses, thus improving its efficiency ratio. Citi maintained disciplined expense management during 2015, even as it continued to absorb increased regulatory and compliance costs and made ongoing business investments. The company significantly reduced the assets in Citi Holdings during the year, with a decrease of $55 billion, or 43%, from 2014. Citi Holdings maintained profitability in 2015 despite the wind-down of its portfolio. The utilization of deferred tax assets during 2015 amounted to approximately $1.5 billion. Citi achieved these results amid market volatility and uncertainties, including macroeconomic uncertainties, slower global growth, and market volatility resulting from lower commodity prices and uncertainty regarding U.S. interest rate changes. The operating environment in 2016 is expected to remain challenging, with many uncertainties impacting results continuing into the new year. Citi intends to build on the progress made during 2015 by remaining focused on its execution priorities and target client strategy. The company reported a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 12.1% as of December 31, 2015, reflecting its commitment to maintaining a strong capital position. Citi's total provisions for credit losses and benefits increased by 6% from the prior year, with net credit losses declining by 19%. The organization expects credit costs in Citicorp to likely be higher in 2016 as credit quality stabilizes. The net reserve build in Citicorp was primarily driven by net loan loss reserve builds in the Institutional Clients Group during the latter part of 2015, including significant provisions for energy-related exposures. Citi's strategic initiatives included efficient resource allocation and disciplined expense management, which were essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to external pressures. The company also focused on maintaining profitability while executing its wind-down strategy for non-core assets, demonstrating resilience in the face of adverse conditions. Overall, Citi's performance in 2015 exemplified its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite challenging conditions, reflecting a commitment to organizational resilience through effective risk management and resource allocation strategies.

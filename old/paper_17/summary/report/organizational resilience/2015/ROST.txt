Our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2015 may contain forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future events and our projected growth, financial performance, operations, and competitive position that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. We expect competition to increase in the future, and intense pressures from our competitors or our inability to adapt effectively to a changing competitive landscape could reduce demand for our merchandise and negatively affect our sales and margins. Our success depends on our ability to effectively buy and resell merchandise that meets customer demand, and we work on an ongoing basis to identify customer trends and preferences. Failure to correctly anticipate and match the trends, preferences, and demands of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Disruptions in our supply chain or in our information systems could impact our ability to process sales and deliver products to our stores in a timely manner. We depend on the integrity and consistent operations of our information systems to manage key aspects of our business, and we are making significant technology investments to improve these systems. The risk of system disruption is increased whenever significant system changes are undertaken, and excessive technological change could impact our operational effectiveness. Any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A disruption within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to transport merchandise to our stores or distribution centers, impairing our ability to meet customer demand for products. We must effectively manage our inventories, markdowns, and inventory shortages to achieve our planned gross margins. Our growth strategy is based on successfully expanding our off-price model in current markets and entering new geographic markets, which involves significant risks. New markets may have competitive conditions and consumer tastes that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than in our existing markets. We must continually attract, train, and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our off-price retail strategies, and excessive turnover may result in higher costs associated with finding and training new associates. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health care costs. We are subject to impacts from the macro-economic environment, financial and credit markets, and geopolitical conditions that affect consumer confidence and disposable income. Adverse developments in these areas could reduce demand for our merchandise and negatively affect our sales and margins. We also face risks associated with importing merchandise from other countries, including potential disruptions in imports due to geopolitical instability or trade restrictions. Our reputation is partially based on perceptions of various subjective qualities and overall integrity, and any incident that erodes customer trust could adversely affect our business. We must effectively advertise and market our business, as customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our marketing activities and the reputation of our brands. Our operational flexibility is essential for adapting to changing market conditions, and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to support our growth plans and financial performance. We estimate that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and fund our planned capital investments.

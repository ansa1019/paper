Volatile global and local commodity pricing strongly affects Occidental's results of operations, with financial results correlating closely to the prices obtained for its products, particularly oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Prices for these commodities fluctuate widely, and prolonged declines could impact Occidental's operating results and cash flows, potentially affecting its future rate of growth and the recoverability of asset values. The company faces risks from operational impacts such as production disruptions, technological advances, and regional market conditions, which include available transportation capacity and infrastructure constraints. Changes in weather patterns and the military and political environment also pose uncertainties that could affect operations. Occidental's strategic review of operations may lead to restructuring activities that could impact stock prices and market value, as management may take different actions than expected or experience delays and cost overruns in development efforts. The company bears risks associated with equipment failures, construction delays, and disappointing drilling results, which may affect its ability to grow production and achieve targeted returns. The oil and gas business operates in highly competitive environments, affecting its ability to acquire reserves and grow production. Occidental's ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is crucial. The company implements strategies to maximize returns by investing in projects that generate long-term value and maintaining financial discipline. Occidental's focus on operational flexibility and strategic initiatives aims to limit financial and political risks while managing commodity price volatility. The company strives to retain sufficient cash on hand and maintain a low debt-to-capitalization ratio to access capital markets. Additionally, Occidental's restructuring efforts include exiting non-core operations, which is expected to improve margins through lower cash operating costs. The company utilizes enhanced oil recovery techniques and maintains a disciplined approach toward acquisitions and divestitures, emphasizing value creation. Occidental's operations are subject to various governmental regulations and political interests, which may restrict activities or increase costs. The company evaluates risks associated with international operations, particularly in politically unstable regions, and seeks to mitigate these risks through strategic planning and resource management. Occidental's commitment to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to changing market conditions is essential for its resilience and long-term success. The company continuously measures its performance against key metrics that drive total stockholder return, including health, environmental, safety, and process metrics, alongside financial performance indicators.

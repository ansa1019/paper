The following discussion describes certain risk factors that could affect our business and prospects, including competition and industry consolidation that may erode profit. Our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the United States and other countries where we do business. Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers, thereby reducing purchases by our customers, which would negatively affect revenue growth and profitability. Negative trends in the general economy, including interest rate fluctuations and financial market volatility, may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. A decline in the number of generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable could adversely impact results of operations. The bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant supplier or customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts due to us, and volatility in capital and credit markets may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers. The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationships may not be realized due to various challenges and uncertainties, including the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of strategic arrangements. Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase costs and reduce profitability. Regulatory changes could adversely affect our results of operations, as compliance with new requirements may require significant adjustments to our operations. Natural disasters or other unexpected events could disrupt operations, adversely affecting results and financial condition. The occurrence of unexpected events could result in physical damage to distribution centers or outsourcing facilities, leading to temporary or long-term disruption in supply and delivery capabilities. Our business relies on sophisticated information systems to manage data and facilitate operations, and any failure in these systems could disrupt business continuity. Cybersecurity remains a priority, as breaches could result in the disclosure of confidential information and damage our reputation. We are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations related to healthcare fraud and abuse, and failure to comply could result in significant penalties. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation, which can lead to civil, criminal, and administrative liability. Acquisitions may also pose risks, including the potential for difficulties in integration and the failure to achieve projected results. Our global operations are subject to various risks, including changes in local laws and economic conditions. We are exposed to market risks, including interest rate fluctuations and foreign currency risks, which could impact our financial position. The ability to manage these risks effectively is essential for maintaining operational resilience and ensuring the continuity of our services.

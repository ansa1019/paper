Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable. Our operating results have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to do so due to factors outside of our control, including changes in customer needs and market conditions. The timing of shipments may depend on various factors such as logistics and inventory management, which can affect our ability to meet demand and recognize revenue. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology, and adverse economic conditions may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. We rely significantly on revenue from our security subscription and technical support services, which may fluctuate due to factors such as customer satisfaction and competitive pricing. Our ability to execute our strategy to increase sales to large and medium-sized enterprises is critical, as these customers often have complex requirements and longer sales cycles. We may face increased competition and challenges in managing our channel partners, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. Additionally, disruptions in our supply chain or the financial health of our channel partners could impact our ability to deliver products and services. 

We are subject to various risks associated with international sales and operations, including economic or political instability in foreign markets and regulatory compliance challenges. Our ability to manage inventory effectively is complex and may result in lost sales opportunities or excess inventory write-downs. We depend on the continued performance of our senior management and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, as turnover in management can significantly affect our business. Our future performance is also contingent on our ability to implement an enterprise resource planning system effectively, as any disruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial reporting. 

The network security market is rapidly evolving, and our success depends on our ability to adapt to technological advancements and changing customer needs. We must continue to innovate and respond promptly to market developments to maintain our competitive position. Our sales strategy relies on a distribution model, and we depend on our channel partners to generate sales opportunities. If our partners fail to perform or if we cannot maintain effective relationships with them, our ability to sell our products may be limited. 

We face risks related to warranty claims, product defects, and potential litigation, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. Our business is also subject to the risks of natural disasters and other catastrophic events, which could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to meet financial targets. We must manage our operational resources effectively to ensure continuity and resilience in the face of these challenges. Our growth strategy includes expanding our sales coverage and investing in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership position, which is essential for long-term success in a competitive market.

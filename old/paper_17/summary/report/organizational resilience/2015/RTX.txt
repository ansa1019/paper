Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be impacted by various factors, including global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, which may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated future results. The tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing, potentially resulting in a decrease in orders for our products and services. Decreases in economic activity can adversely affect our financial performance, particularly in the construction and aerospace industries. The cyclical nature of the commercial aviation and defense industries means that our financial performance is directly tied to economic conditions, which are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including regulatory changes and competition. Future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues, or major natural disasters could dramatically reduce demand for air travel, negatively impacting our aerospace businesses. Changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request rescheduling or cancellation of orders, especially for commercial aerospace customers. Our reliance on suppliers exposes us to volatility in prices and availability of materials, which could adversely impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. We engage in acquisitions and divestitures, which may encounter difficulties in integration and realization of anticipated benefits, potentially adversely affecting our business and results of operations. Our debt levels and related obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in market conditions, exposing us to interest rate risk. We may be adversely affected by attacks on our information technology infrastructure and other cyber-based disruptions, which could result in production downtimes and operational delays. Our ability to protect our intellectual property is crucial, as infringement or failure to protect it could adversely affect our growth and success. We are subject to various litigation and legal compliance risks that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and financial condition. Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risk, which could adversely affect our results. We may be unable to realize expected benefits from cost reduction and restructuring efforts, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our competitive position. Cyber-based risks are evolving and include attacks on our IT infrastructure, which could compromise our operations and lead to significant financial losses. We believe we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks; however, the unpredictability of such attacks could impact our ability to provide products and services. Changes in laws and regulations, including those related to environmental compliance, could lead to increased costs and affect our operational strategies. The complexity of our operations and the need for effective management of various risks highlight the importance of maintaining organizational resilience to adapt and respond to external pressures and disruptions.

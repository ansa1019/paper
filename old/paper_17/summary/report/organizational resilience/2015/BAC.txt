In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others that are more specific to our own businesses. Our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected by the U.S. and international financial markets, fiscal and monetary policy, and economic conditions generally. Liquidity risk is the potential inability to meet expected or unexpected liquidity needs while continuing to support our business and customer needs under a range of economic conditions. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets, illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets, unforeseen outflows of cash, or negative perceptions about our short- or long-term business prospects. We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis, and legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, and we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to the types of risk to which we are subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational, and reputational risks. Our risk management processes require that strong risk management practices are integrated into key strategic, capital, and financial planning processes. We employ a risk management process referred to as identify, measure, monitor, and control, which is part of our daily activities. We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. The corporation's capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite, and risk limits. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite and specifically addresses strategic risks. We continuously monitor business performance throughout the year to assess strategic risk and find early warning signals so that risks can be proactively managed. Our lines of business operate with risk limits based on the amount of capital, earnings, or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. We have developed and maintain contingency plans designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of potential adverse outcomes and scenarios. Our businesses rely on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years, and we continuously update our systems to support our operations and growth. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened due to the evolving nature of these threats, our prominent size and scale, and our role in the financial services industry and the broader economy. We believe that our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical to our organizational resilience, enabling us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations.

This report contains forward-looking statements that are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results may differ materially. Important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially include financial risks, such as declines in market prices of copper, gold, and oil, which have adversely affected earnings, cash flows, and asset values. In response to lower commodity prices, revised operating plans have been announced that incorporate significant reductions in capital spending, production curtailments, and actions to reduce operating, exploration, and administrative costs. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform operations to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. The organization is pursuing asset sales and joint venture arrangements to raise proceeds for debt reduction, which may not achieve desired levels due to unfavorable market conditions. The operational flexibility of the organization is limited by its level of indebtedness and other financial commitments, which could increase vulnerability to adverse economic conditions. The strategic review of the oil and gas business may not result in increased stockholder value, and mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs. The organization must provide financial assurance for its environmental obligations, which may change due to evolving regulations. The international operations are subject to political, social, and geographic risks, which may adversely affect business operations. The organization is engaged in discussions with the Indonesian government regarding long-term mining rights, and failure to reach satisfactory agreements could require reductions in investments and adversely affect future production. Labor unrest and activism could disrupt operations, and the organization must maintain secure water supplies for mining activities, as competition for water is significant in certain regions. The organization has significant undeveloped reserves and resources, and future investments will be based on economic and technical feasibility studies. The ability to replenish reserves is essential for long-term success, and exploration activities are being deferred due to current market conditions. The organization is focused on managing production activities, spending on capital projects, and administration to enhance cash flows. The strategic initiatives include reducing costs and capital expenditures while pursuing asset sales to strengthen financial position. The organization’s cash flow is influenced by commodity price fluctuations, and lower cash production costs are expected in 2016 due to increased production and cost reduction efforts. The organization’s operations are subject to extensive regulations, and compliance with environmental laws involves significant costs. The organization must continually assess its long-lived assets for impairment, and changes in commodity prices and future cash flow estimates could result in significant impacts on financial results. The organization is committed to maintaining operational continuity and adapting to changes in the business environment to ensure resilience and long-term sustainability.

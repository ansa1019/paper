The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, including those related to market conditions for oil and natural gas, which can adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, profitability, and growth. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices, influenced by various external pressures such as supply and demand, political conditions, and economic factors, complicates our ability to predict future price movements. The ongoing decline in prices may reduce our operational flexibility and the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically, potentially leading to substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. Concerns over global economic conditions and geopolitical issues could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and adapt to changing market conditions is critical for maintaining operational continuity and achieving our major objectives. We are committed to strategic initiatives that enhance our resilience, including monitoring the commodity price environment and adjusting our drilling and completion plans accordingly. Our success depends on finding, developing, or acquiring additional reserves, which requires significant capital and the ability to effectively manage our resources. We may be required to seek additional sources of capital, which could include traditional reserve base borrowings or joint venture partnerships. The cyclical nature of the oil and natural gas industry may lead to shortages of drilling rigs and other operational resources, impacting our ability to execute our development plans. Our operations are also subject to various governmental laws and regulations, which can impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints. The concentration of our producing properties in the Permian Basin exposes us to risks associated with regional supply and demand factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We rely on several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production, and the loss of one or more of these purchasers could limit our access to suitable markets. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on our ability to manage our operations and adapt to changes in the competitive landscape. We are also exposed to cyber security risks, which could disrupt our operations and affect our ability to maintain resilience in the face of unexpected situations. Our reliance on key personnel and the potential loss of their services could adversely affect our business operations. The successful integration of acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations is essential for maintaining organizational coherence and achieving strategic resilience. We continuously evaluate our operational practices and resource management strategies to enhance our adaptability and ensure long-term organizational health in a turbulent market environment.

We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. Global economic and political conditions may further impact our business, financial results, and financial condition. The past several years were characterized by weak global economic conditions, volatile credit markets, and uncertainty about certain governments' abilities to repay debt. Economic growth in countries where we do business may slow, leading customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, which could adversely affect our sales and financial performance. Uncertainty about current and future economic and political conditions complicates our ability to forecast operating results and make decisions about future investments. Our financial performance may be negatively impacted by the lack of credit available to key channel partners, counterparty failures, and decreased borrowing and spending by end users. We are transitioning to cloud-based products and flexible product licenses, which requires considerable investment of resources and poses risks related to market acceptance and customer demand. Our strategy to develop and introduce new products exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance and costs related to product defects. Rapid technological changes and shifts in customer requirements necessitate constant evaluation of our business model and strategy. We aim to provide solutions that enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative, which is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. Our restructuring plan aims to reduce expenses and streamline operations to align with our business model transition. We have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to mitigate the impact of catastrophic events, although there can be no assurance that these measures will be fully effective. Our dependency on international revenue exposes us to significant regulatory and economic risks, which could adversely impact our financial results. We face increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes that may reduce our revenue and profits. The software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the transition to cloud and mobile computing poses a disruptive challenge to established companies. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical for meeting objectives such as timely product introductions and financial goals. We continually assess our business model and strategies to ensure we can adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. Our financial results fluctuate due to various factors, including economic conditions, customer demand, and the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives. We recognize that our business model transition will require ongoing adjustments and adaptations to maintain operational continuity and achieve long-term growth.

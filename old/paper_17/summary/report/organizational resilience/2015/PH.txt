The company may be subject to risks arising from uncertainty in worldwide and regional economic conditions, which could materially adversely affect its financial and operational performance. The company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, engaging in various business realignment initiatives, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and managing its cash. The company regularly executes organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures, and realignments to support its growth and cost management strategies. The company also engages in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies, and cash flow and to reduce costs. If the company is unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings could be materially adversely affected. The company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services, and entering into joint ventures, which it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. However, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that it will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business. The successful integration of new businesses and the success of joint ventures depend on the company's ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. The company relies extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate its business, which are critical to its operations. If these systems are damaged, attacked, or cease to function properly, the company could suffer interruptions in its ability to manage and operate its business. The company may be subject to risks relating to changes in the demand for and supply of its products, which may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in business relationships with major customers, suppliers, or distributors, increased competition, and fluctuations in the availability or prices of raw materials. The company’s ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. If the company does not develop innovative new products or fails to gain market acceptance, its revenues may be materially reduced. The company may incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with environmental laws, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. The company is subject to various laws and regulations, including those related to environmental protection, which impose penalties for non-compliance. The company may be subject to risks arising from litigation and regulatory proceedings that could materially adversely impact its business. The company’s future results of operation could be adversely affected by changes in its effective tax rate due to changes in the mix of earnings among jurisdictions. The company may face risks related to product liability, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. The company is subject to risks arising from the preservation of its intellectual property, which is critical to its innovation efforts. Unauthorized use of the company's intellectual property rights could adversely impact its competitive position and results of operations. The company’s ability to maintain its operational continuity and performance amidst various pressures and disruptions is crucial for its resilience and long-term success.

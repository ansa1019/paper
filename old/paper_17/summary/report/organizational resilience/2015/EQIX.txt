In evaluating our business, we recognize that many factors could affect our ability to maintain operational continuity and achieve our major objectives, particularly in the context of the acquisition and integration of TelecityGroup. The anticipated benefits of this acquisition may not be realized fully and may take longer to achieve than expected, which could impact our organizational health and performance. The success of the TelecityGroup acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively integrate our operations and realize anticipated synergies and cost savings. We may encounter material challenges during this integration process, including the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns, managing a larger combined company, and integrating two distinct corporate cultures. Retaining key employees, customers, and suppliers is crucial, as uncertainty associated with the acquisition may lead to negotiations for changes in business relationships. Additionally, unforeseen expenses or delays could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

We must also navigate external pressures, including compliance with regulations and the need to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, which requires us to satisfy numerous requirements that may change over time. Our ability to adapt to these challenges is vital for sustaining our competitive advantage and ensuring organizational resilience. The integration of new assets and operations will require effective resource allocation and strategic initiatives to mitigate risks associated with operational disruptions. 

Moreover, our business continuity is contingent upon our capacity to manage significant transaction-related costs and the complexities arising from acquisitions. We recognize that disruptions, whether from internal errors or external disturbances, can adversely affect our operational flexibility and overall performance. The need for effective crisis management strategies and preparedness is paramount, particularly in light of the evolving business environment characterized by uncertainty and volatility. 

Our strategic response to these challenges includes enhancing our organizational capabilities, fostering inter-organizational collaboration, and leveraging our social capital to navigate complex situations. We are committed to maintaining a focus on future planning and adaptability, ensuring that we can respond effectively to unexpected situations and environmental perturbations. The development of resilience strategies and mechanisms to support recovery from adverse events is essential for sustaining our operational integrity and achieving long-term success. 

As we continue to expand our footprint and offerings, we will prioritize the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to the demands of the market. Our organizational dynamics will be critical in facilitating transformation and enhancing our operational management practices, ultimately contributing to our resilience and capacity to flourish in a turbulent business landscape.

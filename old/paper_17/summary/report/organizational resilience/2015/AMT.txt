A significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications sites could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include increased use of network sharing or mergers among wireless service providers, zoning, environmental, health, tax, or other government regulations, and the financial condition of wireless service providers. Our ongoing contractual revenues and future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed. We may experience increased competition for assets, which could make the acquisition of high-quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive. Our business is subject to government and tax regulations, and changes in laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate as we currently do. Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us, including our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures and future growth initiatives. Our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to the integration of acquired or leased assets, which could adversely affect our operating results or expose us to additional risk. If we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity, we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios, adversely affecting our business and financial condition. Our international operations expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems, including changes in political or economic conditions, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position. We face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect our ability to plan and budget for our international operations. Our revenues from international operations are primarily denominated in local currencies, and a weakening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues and profits. We rely on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities, and if our computer systems are compromised, we could suffer interruptions in our operations or incur significant costs to remediate these issues. We may be liable for substantial costs of investigation and remediation of environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and unforeseen events, and any damage to our towers may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants. We do not maintain significant insurance coverage for these matters, which could further expose us to financial risks. Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon maintaining recurring revenue and converting it into operating profit by minimizing costs and achieving operational efficiencies. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants, and a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. The loan agreements for our credit facilities contain financial and operating covenants that we must comply with, and failure to comply could result in default, affecting our ability to borrow additional funds. Our ability to raise additional capital may be limited, and if we are unable to do so, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures or satisfy our distribution requirements.

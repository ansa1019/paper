Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including economic conditions that may adversely impact demand for our products and reduce access to credit, which could challenge our business continuity and operational flexibility. The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including general business conditions and consumer confidence, which can lead to decreased demand for our products. We are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales, and extreme weather conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of automotive parts. Our ability to open additional profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives, which is dependent on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions and general business and economic conditions. Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel, and we must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers, and financial or operational difficulties faced by suppliers could disrupt our relationships and impact our ability to source products. We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy, but acquisitions involve risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations. Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores, resulting in lost sales or potential loss of customer loyalty. We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory and process transactions, and any damage or interruption to these systems could negatively impact our revenue. Our continued success depends on our ability to preserve, grow, and leverage the value of our brand, and failure to maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce brand value. We believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund both our short-term and long-term capital and liquidity needs, although there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above recent levels. Our liquidity and related ratios indicate that we are in compliance with our financing obligations, but a failure to comply with these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers' changing preferences, and we believe that the key drivers of current and future demand for our products include the number of miles driven, the total number of registered vehicles, and the average age of the vehicle population. Our ability to adapt to changes in the competitive landscape and to manage operational resources effectively will be critical for maintaining our organizational resilience and achieving our strategic objectives.

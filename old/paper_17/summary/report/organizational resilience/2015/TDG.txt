Our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers' planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, and our customers' profitability, which are affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions. The airline industry has been severely affected by downturns in the global economy, higher fuel prices, and increased security concerns, which could impact future profitability and demand for our products. We rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales, and a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers could adversely affect our net sales, gross margin, and net income. Our business strategy includes obtaining profitable new business, improving our cost structure, and providing highly engineered value-added products, which we believe contributes to our resilience in maintaining operational effectiveness under challenging conditions. We have achieved steady long-term growth due to our competitive strengths and execution of our value-driven operating strategy. Our diversified revenue base reduces dependence on any particular product or market channel, which has been significant in maintaining financial performance. The aerospace industry remains highly fragmented, presenting opportunities for acquisitions that can enhance our operational capabilities and resilience. We have successfully integrated numerous acquisitions into our existing operations, improving performance and capacity utilization. Our operations are also subject to unique risks, particularly in supplying equipment and services to the U.S. government, which can unilaterally suspend contracts or reduce their value. Our ability to adapt to changes in the business environment is critical, as we must anticipate future orders based on historical purchasing patterns and customer discussions. We face significant competition, and our ability to compete relies on high product performance, quality, timely delivery, and superior customer service. Our financial health is impacted by our substantial indebtedness, which increases vulnerability to economic downturns and limits flexibility in responding to changes in the market. We have implemented risk management strategies, including interest rate hedging, to mitigate financial risks associated with our debt. Our operations are also impacted by environmental regulations, and we are subject to various business risks that could affect our operational continuity. The successful integration of acquisitions requires substantial management attention, which could detract from other strategic initiatives. Our business is dependent on a highly trained workforce, and any work stoppage could materially affect our ability to provide products to customers. We maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods, making us vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Our facilities are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters, and any disruption could significantly impact our financial condition. Overall, our organizational resilience is supported by a multifaceted approach to managing risks, maintaining operational flexibility, and adapting to changing market conditions.

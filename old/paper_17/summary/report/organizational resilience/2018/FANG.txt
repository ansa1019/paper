The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The integration of Energ√©n's business into our operations may not achieve the intended benefits or may encounter operational challenges, including complexities associated with managing a larger, more complex business and integrating personnel from the two companies. Our future success will depend on our ability to manage this expanded business efficiently and effectively. We continuously monitor the ongoing commodity price environment and expect to retain the financial flexibility to adjust our drilling and completion plans in response to market conditions. The anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our businesses may not be fully realized or could take longer than expected, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We face risks associated with the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which have historically affected our revenue, cash flows, and profitability. Our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations, which may impose additional obligations and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance. We may incur significant delays, costs, and liabilities as a result of environmental, health, and safety requirements applicable to our business activities. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including recoverable reserves and potential environmental liabilities, which may not always be fully identifiable. Our ability to complete acquisitions and manage our operations effectively may be hindered by the need to integrate acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations, which could involve unforeseen difficulties. We are also subject to risks associated with our reliance on key personnel, and the loss of such individuals could disrupt our operations. Our business operations have grown substantially, and we expect this growth to continue, which will place additional demands on our financial, technical, operational, and management resources. We are focused on maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changing market conditions, which is critical for our resilience. Our capital expenditures are largely discretionary and within our control, allowing us to adjust our planned expenditures based on various factors, including commodity prices and operational success. We have made substantial capital expenditures for the development, production, exploration, and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves, and our future success will depend on our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional reserves economically. Our operations are highly dependent on the availability of water, and restrictions on our ability to obtain water may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas, and our financial performance is sensitive to changes in commodity prices and market conditions. The successful execution of our business strategy will depend on our ability to manage these risks effectively while maintaining a focus on operational excellence and strategic initiatives that enhance our organizational resilience.

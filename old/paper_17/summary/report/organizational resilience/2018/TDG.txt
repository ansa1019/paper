The commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that customers' planes spend aloft, the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet, and customers' profitability, which are affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions. These factors have historically correlated with revenue passenger miles and airline profitability, which can be severely impacted by downturns in the global economy, higher fuel prices, and increased security concerns. The airline industry has incurred large losses and financial difficulties during periods of reduced profitability, leading some airlines to delay purchases of spare parts and reduce workforces. An adverse change in demand could impact results of operations and cash flow generation. The company relies heavily on certain customers, and a material reduction in purchasing by larger customers could have a material adverse effect on net sales, gross margin, and net income. The company does not generally have guaranteed future sales and must anticipate future order volumes based on historical purchasing patterns and discussions with customers. The military and defense market is dependent upon government budget trends, and significant declines in military expenditures could reduce the amount of products sold to U.S. government agencies. The company intends to pursue acquisitions, which may be adversely affected if suitable candidates are not available or if integration efforts do not meet expectations. The successful integration of new businesses depends on the ability to manage these businesses effectively, which may require substantial attention from senior management. The company is subject to unique risks due to supplying equipment and services to the U.S. government, including potential contract terminations and audits that could impact revenue and profitability. The aerospace industry is highly regulated, and compliance with new regulations could incur significant expenses. The company depends on a skilled workforce, and any difficulty in hiring or retaining employees could adversely affect business operations. The company faces significant competition, and its ability to compete depends on high product performance, quality, and customer service. The company is also exposed to potential liabilities for personal injury or death resulting from product failures. The interpretation and application of data protection laws are evolving, and compliance may require changes to business practices. The company has recorded significant intangible assets, which may never generate expected returns. The company's capital structure comprises a mix of equity and debt financing, and it expects to meet current obligations through internally generated funds or refinancing. The company evaluates its leverage to optimize returns and pursue acquisitions, and its ability to generate cash will depend on various factors beyond its control. The company generated significant net cash from operating activities, and changes in inventories and accounts payable have improved cash flow. The company expects its capital expenditures to align with its core value-driven operating strategies, focusing on obtaining profitable new business and improving cost structures.

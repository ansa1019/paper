We develop a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how actors project temporal trajectories of responses toward disruptive events, reconstitute the trajectories in immediate response to the event, and reconfigure the trajectories toward the ensuing future. The concept of resilience draws attention to systems as well as individuals, to partial maintenance of integrity and performance, to the opposite of brittleness, and to disturbances that vary both in scale and source. Resilience is a multifaceted concept that reflects businesses’ ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish. We expect operations to stabilize in 2019, with improving execution, a refocused services strategy, and strong execution on cost reduction. We have made significant changes and are heavily focused on improving our operational and project execution across every business. Our outlook for power has continued to deteriorate driven by the significant overcapacity in the industry resulting in decreased utilization of our power equipment, lower market penetration, increased price concessions on certain long-term contracts as well as the uncertain timing of deal closures due to financing and the complexities of working in emerging markets. The power market as well as its operating environment continues to be challenging, and market factors such as increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy penetration continue to impact our view of long-term demand. We believe that the overall market for annual heavy-duty gas orders will be between 25 and 30 gigawatts for 2019 and the foreseeable future. We have also recognized non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charges related to our power generation and grid solutions reporting units. The conditions have resulted in downward revisions of our forecasts on current and future projected earnings and cash flows at these businesses. We expect to generate net cash proceeds of at least $30 billion from various transactions, including the spin-off and subsequent merger of our transportation segment with wabtec corporation. The renewable energy market remains competitive, particularly in onshore wind. The onshore wind market continues to experience megawatt growth as customer preference has shifted from 1.x-2.x models to larger, more efficient units. Given price pressure, the need for grid flexibility to accommodate more renewable energy, and the diversification of energy players, the hydropower industry continues to maximize value with new small-scale and pumped storage projects to support both wind and solar expansion. We have also initiated a comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions across all insurance products, which included reconstructing our future claim cost projections for long-term care contracts utilizing trends observed in our emerging experience for older claimant ages and later duration policies. The increase to future policy benefit reserves was primarily attributable to higher interest rates leading to higher inflation which increased projected utilization on long-term care insurance policies. Our digital initiatives, including analytics on flight operations, technical operations, and advanced manufacturing, are enabling our customers, internal operations, and suppliers to reduce costs, cycle time, and improve quality. We expect to retain approximately $4 billion of cash per year compared to the prior payout level.

Our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. Significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and U.S. government funding may negatively impact our business and programs. The U.S. government has the ability to terminate contracts for convenience or default based on performance, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our ability to compete for other contracts. We face an uncertain political environment and substantial fiscal and economic challenges, which affect funding for discretionary and non-discretionary budgets. The budget control act mandated spending caps for all federal discretionary spending, including specific limits for defense spending. If annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted, the U.S. government may operate under a continuing resolution, presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets. We believe continued budget pressures would have serious negative consequences for the defense industrial base and the customers, employees, suppliers, investors, and communities that rely on companies in this sector. The occurrence of investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, and other legal proceedings could divert financial and management resources and harm our business. Our ability to maintain a qualified workforce is critical to our success, and we face increased competition for talent. Many of our contracts require innovative design capabilities and are technologically complex, which presents risks if we fail to meet our contractual obligations. Environmental matters, including unforeseen costs associated with compliance and remediation efforts, could adversely affect our reputation and financial position. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and compliance requires significant operating and capital costs. Natural disasters could disrupt our business and adversely affect our profitability. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risks, which could adversely affect our financial position. We rely on subcontractors and suppliers for raw materials and components, and disruptions caused by their performance problems could impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including geopolitical and economic factors, which could impact funding for programs and alter export authorizations. We must also comply with various procurement and other laws and regulations applicable to our industry, and changes in these laws could adversely affect our profitability. Our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain the necessary facilities and equipment. Changes in future business conditions could cause business investments to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses. The ultimate resolution of claims and disputes may vary materially from earlier estimates, and we are subject to various environmental laws that could result in significant costs. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and manage risks effectively is essential for maintaining operational continuity and achieving our strategic objectives.

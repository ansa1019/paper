Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and our operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable due to factors outside of our control. Our ability to attract and retain customers, manage inventory, and respond to changes in market demand are critical to maintaining operational continuity and resilience. We rely on a concentration of shipments at the end of each quarter, which may lead to fluctuations in our financial results. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and is sensitive to economic conditions, geopolitical instability, and changes in customer purchasing behavior. We may experience longer sales cycles and reduced unit sales due to adverse economic conditions, which could impact our ability to meet financial targets. 

Our sales strategy is based on a two-tier distribution model, and we depend on our channel partners to generate a significant portion of our sales opportunities. If our partners fail to perform or if we cannot retain high-quality partners, our ability to sell our products may be limited. The loss of significant channel partners could harm our operating results, and we may face challenges related to the financial health of our partners. 

We are also subject to risks associated with international sales and operations, including economic or political instability in foreign markets, difficulties in enforcing contracts, and changes in regulatory requirements. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to risks such as manufacturing delays and quality control issues, which could disrupt our supply chain and impact our ability to fulfill orders. 

Our business is subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply could result in increased costs and reputational damage. We must also manage risks related to cybersecurity, as breaches could adversely affect our reputation and customer trust. Our success depends on our ability to provide effective network security protection, and any perceived vulnerabilities could harm our business. 

We have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, but violations could lead to litigation and regulatory action. Our ability to manage future growth effectively is contingent upon our capacity to improve and expand our information technology systems and controls. We must continue to enhance our operational management and disaster recovery plans to ensure resilience against unexpected disruptions. 

The complexity of our operations and the need for effective coordination throughout our organization are critical for maintaining performance under pressure. We are committed to investing in our workforce and enhancing our organizational capabilities to adapt to changing market conditions. Our future planning includes evaluating the impact of strategic initiatives and resource allocation to ensure we can respond effectively to external pressures and maintain competitive advantage.

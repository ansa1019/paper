The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, or geopolitical events, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, closure of stores, and disruption in the supply of products from suppliers, which may materially adversely affect our business. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand, and our failure to adequately respond to changing consumer tastes could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the growth of our business. The retail business is rapidly evolving, and our strategy, which includes acquisitions and investments in e-commerce and technology, may not adequately allow us to grow our e-commerce business or maintain our market position. Operational risks include natural disasters and changes in climate, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions and manage our business, and disruptions in these systems could harm our ability to conduct operations. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and any breach of our security measures could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. We are subject to various legal, regulatory, and compliance risks that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. Our ability to attract and retain qualified associates is critical to our operations, and increases in labor costs or changes in labor laws could adversely affect our financial performance. We are also subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may materially adversely affect our financial performance. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, and changes in tax laws could materially affect our financial performance. We discuss our existing investigations and legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity, and we believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations and growth activities. We have made certain strategic portfolio decisions, including acquisitions and divestitures, which may impact our financial performance. Our business is seasonal, and our highest sales volume generally occurs during specific fiscal periods. We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs, and we continuously adjust our business strategies to maintain our competitive position.

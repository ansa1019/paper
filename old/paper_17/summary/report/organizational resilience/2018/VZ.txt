The following discussion of risks is designed to highlight important factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, or future performance. Cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business, causing equipment failures, loss of information, and disruptions to our operations. While we have not been subject to material cyber attacks to date, the preventive actions we take may be insufficient to mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. The inability to operate our networks and systems as a result of cyber attacks may result in significant expenses and a loss of market share. Natural disasters, terrorist acts, or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters and events beyond our control, which could result in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. The potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. We depend on key suppliers and vendors for equipment and services necessary to operate our business. If these suppliers fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as requested by our customers, which could disrupt our operations. Our dependence on key suppliers could lead to substantial disruptions if we were required to transition to alternative sources on short notice. We face significant competition that may reduce our profits, and the rapid development of new technologies has brought new competitors to our markets. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our network quality, pricing, and customer service, as well as our ability to anticipate and respond to factors affecting our industries. If we are unable to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology, we may experience a decline in demand for our services. Adverse economic conditions could impact our results of operations, as consumers may reduce discretionary spending or delay purchasing decisions. Changes in the regulatory framework could adversely affect our business prospects, and we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages. Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further, and adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs. Increases in costs for pension benefits and healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability. Our system redundancy may be ineffective, and our ability to maintain operational continuity could be challenged by various risks. The multifaceted nature of resilience requires us to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes to survive and grow. Our organizational capabilities must be aligned with strategic initiatives to enhance our resilience in the face of adversity, ensuring we can maintain performance and adapt to complex situations.

Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside of the U.S., generating approximately 19.8% of our revenues from international operations. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting the value of our properties and the availability or terms of financing. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks, despite system redundancy and disaster recovery plans. We depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of our executive officers and key employees, and any loss or change in their roles could adversely affect our business. We may be impacted by deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, which could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements. We hold significant real estate investments in international markets, exposing us to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate our risk by borrowing in the currencies of our significant investments, providing a natural hedge. However, there can be no assurance that these attempts will be successful. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, which may expose us to economic downturns in that sector. General economic conditions and other events affecting our properties may impact financial results. We are also exposed to environmental risks, including potential liabilities for hazardous substances and the impacts of climate change, which may adversely affect our ability to lease, develop, or sell properties. Our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses, and if an uninsured loss occurs, we could experience significant capital loss and future revenue loss. We are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity and overall business. We are required to comply with many regulations in different countries, and noncompliance could result in substantial costs. Our real estate investments are not as liquid as other asset types, limiting our ability to react promptly to changes in economic conditions. We may need to find alternative ways to increase liquidity, which could adversely affect our business and distributable cash flow. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms depends on various factors, including market conditions and our financial performance. We evaluate our business operations based on net operating income, which helps management understand our core operations. Our operating fundamentals remain strong, with high occupancy rates and demand, but we remain cautious due to current market volatility. We continuously review our strategic initiatives and operational flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and ensure organizational resilience in the face of adversity.

Our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition are subject to principal risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near and long term. Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services. The operating results of our aerospace business are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers' inability to scale production and adjust delivery during times of volatile demand. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned, which could impact our operational flexibility and performance maintenance. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing. We seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities and transitions to cost-competitive regions. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives and adverse effects on employee morale. Organizational changes, increased attrition, and failure to create and implement a succession plan for key company positions could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. Our operations are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters, public health crises, and other disruptions, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. We employ comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate cybersecurity threats, which could potentially disrupt business operations and adversely impact our reputation and results. Our facilities, supply chains, and information technology systems are vulnerable to catastrophic loss, and disruptions could interfere with our operations and negatively impact our reputation. We continuously assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes related to various contingencies, including environmental liabilities, and recognize liabilities based on thorough analysis. We believe our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs, and we continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio to identify those that will benefit from increased investment. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan for potential divestiture or restructuring. Our focus on growth, cost reduction, and productivity initiatives is intended to enhance our organizational resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment.

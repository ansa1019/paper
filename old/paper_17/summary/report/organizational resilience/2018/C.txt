Citi made steady progress in 2018 toward improving its profitability and returns, despite a more challenging revenue environment and macroeconomic uncertainties. Citi demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in a decrease in expenses, as well as positive operating leverage, while continuing to make ongoing investments. The company reported revenue growth in all regions in global consumer banking, reflecting continued loan and overall deposit growth, partially offset by the near-term impact of weak market sentiment. Citi intends to continue building on the progress made during 2018 with a focus on optimizing performance to benefit shareholders while remaining flexible and adapting to market and economic conditions. Despite various economic, political, and other risks that could create a more volatile operating environment, Citi's key regulatory capital metrics remained strong. The company generated continued loan and deposit growth during the year and returned significant capital to shareholders. Citigroup's revenues increased, driven by growth across treasury and trade solutions, private bank, securities services, equity markets, and corporate lending, although there was weakness in fixed income and softness in equity and debt underwriting. The company’s operational flexibility and adaptability were evident as it navigated through challenges, including the impact of partnership renewal terms and weak market sentiment. The increase in net income was attributed to a lower effective tax rate, higher revenues, and lower expenses, which were partially offset by higher costs of credit. Citigroup's end-of-period loans and deposits also increased, reflecting growth in both institutional clients and global consumer banking. The company’s strategic initiatives included ongoing investments in technology and modernization of its branch network, which are expected to enhance its operational capabilities and resilience. The focus on maintaining strong credit discipline and managing costs contributed to the improvement in pre-tax earnings. Furthermore, Citi's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and external pressures was highlighted by its strategic response to evolving customer needs and the competitive landscape. The company’s emphasis on resource allocation and operational management underpins its commitment to organizational resilience, ensuring that it can confront adversity and capitalize on opportunities for growth and innovation. Overall, Citi's performance in 2018 reflects its multifaceted approach to maintaining organizational health and effectiveness in a turbulent business environment.

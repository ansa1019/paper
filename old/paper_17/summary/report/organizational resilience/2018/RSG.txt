This annual report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking information that is intended to be covered by the safe harbor for "forward-looking statements." Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are general economic and market conditions, including inflation and changes in commodity pricing, which are not within our control, and our exposure to credit and counterparty risk. Severe weather conditions, including those brought about by climate change, could impair our financial results by causing increased costs, loss of revenue, reduced operational efficiency, or disruptions to our operations. Our ability to manage growth and execute our growth strategy is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to external pressures. We are engaged in numerous strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing our competitive advantage and ensuring business continuity. Our operations are capital-intensive, and our ability to remain competitive and grow depends on cash flow from operations and access to capital. We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or expand existing permitted capacity, which could decrease our revenue and increase our costs. The solid waste industry is highly competitive, and we face pressures from competitors with greater financial and operational resources. Our dependence on key personnel and technology in our operations is critical for effective response strategies to environmental disruptions and unexpected situations. We have implemented various resilience strategies, including risk mitigation measures and resource allocation practices, to enhance our organizational health. Our restructuring efforts, which include consolidating back-office functions, are expected to yield annual savings and improve operational efficiency. We have significant financial obligations relating to capping, closure, post-closure, and remediation costs at our existing landfills. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental regulations and changes in market dynamics is crucial for maintaining organizational effectiveness and ensuring compliance with legal requirements. We are also exposed to environmental liabilities that may not be adequately covered by insurance, which could result in substantial expenses. Our strategic response to evolving market conditions includes enhancing our operational management and investing in technology to improve service innovation. The introduction of new accounting rules and regulations could adversely impact our reported results of operations, requiring us to adapt our financial strategies accordingly. We are committed to maintaining a resilient organizational structure that can withstand economic downturns and respond to emerging challenges. Our focus on operational continuity and crisis management is integral to our long-term success and sustainability in a turbulent market environment.

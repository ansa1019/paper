We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events, and outcomes, including our business outlook and objectives, in this Form 10-K, quarterly and annual reports, press releases, and other communications. Our business is subject to numerous risks due to significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations and localized volatility. We must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing, and operations innovation, as well as responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits. Achieving our business results depends on successfully developing, introducing, and marketing new products and making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. Our organizational structure is designed to enhance operational flexibility and adaptability in response to competitive pressures and market dynamics. We face ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins. Our ability to meet our customers' needs and achieve cost targets depends on maintaining key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations. Disruptions in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. Our ability to manage commodity price fluctuations and other cost pressures is critical to sustaining operational effectiveness. We have undertaken a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing, and overheads. The plan is designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision-making and manufacturing processes. Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments. Successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. We rely on third parties for certain functions, which creates additional risk. An information security or operational technology incident could materially impact our business or reputation. We maintain an information and operational technology risk management program that is supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal stakeholders. Despite our policies and programs, we may not effectively identify and mitigate every risk to which we are exposed. Our financial condition reflects our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to access capital markets at competitive rates. We assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems. Our strategic focus is on winning with consumers by delivering superiority across key elements of product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution, and value equation. We believe our strategies are right for the long-term health of the company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top third of our peer group. The ongoing portfolio of businesses consists of categories where we have leading market positions and strong brands. We must successfully manage the impacts of acquisition, joint venture, and divestiture activities while delivering against our business objectives. Our organizational practices and strategic initiatives are designed to enhance resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment.

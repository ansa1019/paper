Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty, which could adversely affect our organizational resilience. If we do not introduce new and differentiated products in a timely manner, our products may become more susceptible to competition or technologically obsolete, impacting our operational flexibility and overall performance. We devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities; however, the prolonged and uncertain nature of this process can affect our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Supply interruptions could harm our ability to manufacture products, and we rely on a broad range of raw materials from third-party vendors, making us vulnerable to external pressures that could disrupt our operations. General economic conditions could adversely affect the financial viability of our suppliers, potentially impacting our resource allocation and continuity of supply. We actively monitor supplier financial viability to assure continuity of supply, but these efforts may not always succeed. The rigorous regulations imposed by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products may hinder our ability to reconfigure supply arrangements in a timely manner, further complicating our resilience strategies. Our manufacturing processes are complex and subject to strict quality controls, and disruptions can arise from various factors, including equipment malfunction and human error. As we expand into new markets, unanticipated surges in demand could strain our production capacity, necessitating effective crisis management and operational continuity strategies. Our facilities and those of our suppliers could be materially damaged by natural disasters, and while we believe that our exposure to significant losses could be mitigated by our ability to manufacture and distribute products at other facilities, the transition may not be seamless. We regularly explore potential acquisitions and strategic alliances, but the integration of acquired businesses can present unforeseen difficulties that may affect our organizational capabilities. The cardiovascular medical technology industry is highly competitive, and our ability to compete effectively relies on our capacity to develop and acquire new technologies, which requires a talented workforce. Our competitive position can be adversely affected by product problems and safety alerts, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high quality and reliability. We face intense competition, and if we do not demonstrate the full value of our differentiated products, our market position could suffer. The regulatory approval process for new products is inherently uncertain, and unfavorable clinical data could adversely affect our future prospects. Our operations depend on strong relationships with key physicians, and any limitations on these relationships could impact our ability to innovate and respond to customer needs. Cybersecurity threats pose additional risks to our operational integrity, and failures in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations. The health care industry is undergoing consolidation, which may exert downward pressure on our pricing and profitability, necessitating strategic adaptation to maintain our competitive advantage. Our business is also subject to various legal and regulatory risks, which could adversely affect our operational effectiveness and financial condition.

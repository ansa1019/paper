An investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties that can impact organizational resilience. The ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability, and quality of commodities and subsystems are common risks that can affect our operational flexibility and adaptability under challenging conditions. Our revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government, and changes in defense spending or allocation priorities could result in programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated, adversely impacting our financial performance and operational continuity. The budget control act of 2011 establishes caps for defense spending, and continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain, which could have material adverse operational and financial consequences. U.S. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay, which can impact our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer, and the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings. We operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audits that can result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed, impacting our organizational health and resilience. Our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce is crucial for meeting customer needs and sustaining competitive advantage. Failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our future revenue and earnings. We face various cybersecurity threats that could disrupt our operations and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive systems, necessitating robust risk management and crisis response strategies. Our future success depends on our ability to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions, including geopolitical uncertainties and economic volatility. The integration of acquired businesses involves risks and uncertainties that can affect our organizational capabilities and performance. Changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition. Our operational management strategies emphasize cash flow generation and the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash, which is essential for maintaining organizational resilience. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of costs associated with our contracts, and changes in our backlog could adversely affect the profitability of our remaining contracts. The projected timing of cash flows associated with our contractual obligations is based on management's estimates, which are subject to change based on historical experience and current conditions. Our focus on strategic initiatives, including inter-organizational collaboration and resource allocation, is vital for enhancing our resilience and adaptability in the face of external pressures and demands. We continuously evaluate our performance and the implications of operational decisions to ensure that we can confront challenges and maintain operational integrity.

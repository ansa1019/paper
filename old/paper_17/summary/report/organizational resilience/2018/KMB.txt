Our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control, which could adversely affect our financial results and future performance. Significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, and transportation could adversely affect our financial results, and disruptions in production output could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. We maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively. Our operations are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, and pandemics, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. We have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events; however, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations. Our ability to effectively manage foreign market risk, including exposure to currency fluctuations and political instability, is critical to our organizational resilience. We are increasingly dependent on key customers, including large-format retailers and e-tailers, which may have significant bargaining power and could lead to reduced profitability if their policies change. Our competitive strategy involves uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, which could adversely affect our financial results. We may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products, which could decrease our earnings. Our ability to develop new products is contingent upon successfully anticipating consumer needs and preferences, developing technological innovations, and maintaining necessary patent protection. We continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including restructuring programs aimed at streamlining our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. The 2018 global restructuring program is expected to reduce our structural cost base and improve operational efficiency, impacting all business segments and organizations in major geographies. This program includes workforce reductions and is anticipated to generate annual pre-tax savings. Our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and political, social, and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all countries in which we operate, and our inability to comply could negatively impact our reputation and business results. Our information technology systems play a crucial role in our operations, and any interruptions or failures could disrupt our business operations. We are also exposed to increased cyber-security threats, which pose risks to the security of our information technology systems. Our ability to generate cash from operations and our capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital and other needs. We focus on growing our brands, leveraging financial discipline, and allocating capital in value-creating ways, which are essential for maintaining organizational resilience in a competitive marketplace.

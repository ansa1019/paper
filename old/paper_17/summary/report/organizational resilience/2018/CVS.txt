The risks and uncertainties described may affect our ability to maintain operational continuity and organizational resilience. Our businesses depend on our customers' and members' willingness to entrust us with their health-related and other sensitive personal information, and events that adversely affect that trust could impact our brand and reputation. We face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees, and our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees is essential to meet our current and future goals and objectives. The political environment remains uncertain, and changes in public policy, laws, and regulations can adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Our strategy includes effectively investing our capital and human resources in appropriate strategic projects to transform our businesses in response to changing dynamics in the industries in which we operate. Implementing our strategic initiatives will require significant investments of capital and human resources, and our future performance will depend on our ability to design and implement these initiatives. We may not be able to respond adequately to changes in the competitive landscape, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. Our businesses are subject to various business continuity hazards and risks, including natural disasters, utility failures, and cyber attacks, which could disrupt operations and adversely affect performance. We have developed crisis management and disaster recovery procedures; however, these may not be effective in all circumstances. Our information systems are critical to our operations, and any failure or disruption could lead to significant operational challenges. We rely on third parties for certain functions, and their failure to meet contractual obligations could expose us to brand and reputational harm. The consolidation and integration among providers may increase our medical costs and create new competitors, affecting our ability to maintain competitive advantage. Our health care benefits segment faces significant competition, and we must differentiate our products and solutions to retain customers. The integration of our acquisitions increases operational complexity, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from these transactions. Our future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following acquisitions. We expect to continue pursuing joint ventures and strategic alliances, which may present unique risks, including the need for effective governance and compliance with applicable regulations. Our international operations expose us to various political, legal, and regulatory risks that could affect our ability to operate effectively. We must regularly reassess our global infrastructure and implement effective change management processes to address changes in our businesses. Our ability to anticipate and manage these risks is critical to our long-term success and resilience in a rapidly evolving business environment.

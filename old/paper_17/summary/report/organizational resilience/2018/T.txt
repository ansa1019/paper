The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: adverse economic and/or capital access changes in the markets served by us or in countries in which we have significant investments, including the impact on customer demand and our ability and our suppliers' ability to access financial markets at favorable rates and terms; changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs; increases in our benefit plans' costs, including increases due to adverse changes in the United States and foreign securities markets, resulting in worse-than-assumed investment returns and discount rates; adverse changes in mortality assumptions; adverse medical cost trends; and unfavorable or delayed implementation or repeal of healthcare legislation, regulations or related court decisions; the final outcome of FCC and other federal, state or foreign government agency proceedings involving issues that are important to our business; our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies or delivery methods; the extent of competition including from governmental networks and other providers and the resulting pressure on customer totals and segment operating margins; our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition and increasing fragmentation of customer viewing habits; our ability to generate advertising revenue from attractive video content; the availability, cost and our ability to adequately fund additional wireless spectrum and network upgrades; our ability to manage growth in wireless data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms; the impact from major equipment failures on our networks; the effect of security breaches related to the network or customer information; our inability to obtain handsets, equipment/software or have handsets, equipment/software serviced in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers; severe weather conditions including flooding and hurricanes, natural disasters including earthquakes and forest fires, pandemics, energy shortages, wars or terrorist attacks; changes in our corporate strategies, such as changing network-related requirements or acquisitions and dispositions, which may require significant amounts of cash or stock, to respond to competition and regulatory, legislative and technological developments; the uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions, which may result in a significant decrease in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general. Readers are cautioned that other factors discussed in this report, although not enumerated here, also could materially affect our future earnings. Our ability to successfully integrate our WarnerMedia operations, including the ability to manage various businesses in widely dispersed business locations and with decentralized management, is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and adapting to market demands. The organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring resilience in the face of environmental disruptions. The multifaceted nature of resilience reflects our capacity to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change to survive, grow, and flourish.

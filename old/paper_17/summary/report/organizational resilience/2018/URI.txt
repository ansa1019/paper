Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which may impair our business operations and affect our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. A worsening of economic conditions could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Our significant indebtedness increases our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments and limits our flexibility to plan for or react to such developments. We depend on cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments, and our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, we may have to adopt alternative strategies that could limit our growth and operational flexibility. Our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets, which entails risks such as unrecorded liabilities and operational inefficiencies. We have pursued a strategy of optimizing our field operations and implementing lean management techniques to improve sales force effectiveness and operational efficiency. However, the success of these strategies depends on various factors, including market conditions and our ability to manage costs effectively. Disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to monitor and control operations and implement strategic initiatives. We continuously develop and enhance our controls and processes to protect our systems from potential threats, which requires additional resources. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, and any material failure to comply could increase our costs and affect our reputation. Our collective bargaining agreements with union-represented employees could disrupt our ability to serve customers and lead to higher labor costs. We are exposed to various claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully cover them, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. Our operations are also affected by environmental and safety regulations, and compliance costs that are not currently anticipated could impact our financial condition. The cyclical nature of the rental industry and fluctuations in demand for our services could lead to variations in our operating results. We believe that our size and extensive resources provide us with competitive advantages, allowing us to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. Our strategic initiatives include expanding our footprint and enhancing our service offerings, which are aimed at driving profitable growth. We monitor our financial performance closely and assess our ability to meet our obligations under existing debt agreements, which may impose significant operating and financial restrictions. The ability to maintain operational continuity during periods of economic uncertainty is critical to our organizational resilience. Our commitment to improving our operational management and strategic adaptation positions us to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities in the market.

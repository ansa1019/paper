The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating, and environmental matters could affect us, our customers, and the markets we serve. Railroads are subject to commercial regulation, and additional economic regulation could have a significant negative impact on our ability to negotiate prices for rail services and on the efficiency of our operations. The risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the railroad business, which includes the potential for significant costs and liabilities related to environmental matters. Concerns over climate change have led to legislative efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, which could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease the value of coal reserves we own. We must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk, and the transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses. We may be affected by general economic conditions, including prolonged negative changes that could affect producers and consumers of the commodities we carry. Significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and locomotives, impacting our operational flexibility. We rely on technology and improvements in our business operations, and significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems could result in service interruptions or operational difficulties. Labor agreements and potential strikes could adversely affect our operations, leading to significant disruptions. Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs and decreased revenues. We may be affected by terrorism or war, which could cause significant business interruption. Supply constraints resulting from disruptions in fuel markets could impact our operations and those of our customers. The state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity, and instability or disruptions could restrict our access to financing sources. Our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles. We regularly review estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and changes in the business environment. The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. The variability inherent in our operations could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded. We assess our operational capabilities and the potential for various claims and litigation that could result in significant expenditures. Our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations, and we may incur costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters. We have obtained insurance for potential losses, but coverage may not be available on terms acceptable to us. Our strategic initiatives established in 2015 have created a sustainable platform positioning us for continued execution of transformational changes that will provide greater long-term value for our shareholders.

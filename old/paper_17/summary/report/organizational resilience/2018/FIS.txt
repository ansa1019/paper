We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including cybersecurity threats that could disrupt our delivery of services and damage our reputation. The uninterrupted operation of our information systems is critical to our successful operation, and cybersecurity is one of the principal operational risks we face. If we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure or adapt to emerging security threats, it could compromise the confidentiality of the information we secure. Unauthorized access to our systems could result in interruptions in our operations and damage to our reputation. The markets for our services are characterized by constant technological changes and evolving industry standards, and our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our solutions and develop new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients. We operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Global economic, political, and other conditions may adversely affect our clients, which could impact the demand for our services and our revenue. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees, which depend heavily on consumer, business, and government spending. Changes in economic factors or a sustained deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our financial performance. Constraints within global financial markets or international regulatory requirements could also impact our clients' ability to purchase our services. The sales and implementation cycles for many of our software and service offerings can be lengthy and require significant investment from both our clients and us. Failure to close sales or if a client chooses not to complete an installation could adversely affect our financial condition. Our results may fluctuate due to the unpredictable sales cycle and changes in our mix of licenses and services. We may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining our clients, particularly from larger clients who may seek price reductions. Failure to renew client contracts on favorable terms could adversely affect our business. Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if we experience business interruptions, errors, or failures in our information technology systems. Many of our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems, and we may encounter delays when developing new technology solutions. Our systems and operations could be exposed to damage or interruption from various hazards, which could result in business operation interruptions and exposure to liability claims. We attempt to limit our potential liability through various controls, but we cannot be certain that these measures will always be successful. We are also subject to regulatory changes that could result in increased compliance costs or alter the delivery of services to consumers. Our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations relies on skilled personnel, and competition for such skill sets is intense. Failure to attract and retain skilled employees could harm our ability to grow. Our senior management team has significant experience in the financial services industry, and the loss of this leadership could adversely affect our business. We are involved in various litigation matters that could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Our tax returns are subject to review and audit, and an unfavorable outcome could result in higher tax expenses. A material weakness in our internal controls could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information. Strategic transactions, including acquisitions and divestitures, involve significant risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We continue to invest in modernization, innovation, and integrated solutions to meet market demands and compete effectively.

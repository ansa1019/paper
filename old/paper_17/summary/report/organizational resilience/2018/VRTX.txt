Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below. Our business is dependent on our ability to continue to increase revenues from sales of our cystic fibrosis medicines. Our future success requires us to successfully develop, obtain approval for, and commercialize at least one triple combination therapy that will allow us to treat patients and improve treatment options. The concentrated source of revenues presents risks, including the potential for adverse developments with respect to the commercialization of our medicines and reimbursement policies that may affect our ability to obtain reimbursement or reduce the net price received for our products. We are investing significant resources in the development of next-generation CFTR corrector compounds, and if we are unable to demonstrate safety and efficacy, our business would be materially harmed. Our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products in international markets is critical, as pricing and reimbursement are subject to governmental control, and we face challenges in obtaining reimbursement for our medicines in certain markets. Our future product revenues depend on our ability to complete reimbursement discussions in these markets. The increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals generate significant interest from third-party payors in developing cost-containment strategies. Our business faces competition from major pharmaceutical companies with greater financial resources, and we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy, and tolerability to compete effectively. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, our commercialization efforts could be negatively affected, and our business could be materially harmed. Our products are subject to continuing regulatory oversight, and any adverse safety events could negatively affect commercial sales. We maintain a corporate compliance program designed to identify, prevent, and mitigate risks through the implementation of compliance policies and systems. Our research and development expenses include costs incurred for the development of our drugs and drug candidates, and we must allocate resources among various development programs. The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks, including the potential for adverse data from clinical trials. We are committed to investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation to identify and develop transformative medicines. Our operational management requires significant financial resources, and we must effectively manage our operational infrastructure to support our growth. We are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and human safety, and any accidents could result in substantial liabilities. Our ability to attract and retain skilled employees is critical, as our drug discovery and development activities require highly qualified personnel. If we fail to manage our operations effectively, our business may suffer. We have adopted a business continuity plan to address crises, and if we cannot fully implement these plans, we may experience significant disruptions. Our future capital requirements include substantial operating expenses for research and development activities, and we may need to raise additional capital through various financing opportunities. We will continue to evaluate our collaborations and strategic investments to enhance our pipeline and research capabilities.

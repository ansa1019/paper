AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it, which could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. The risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. AbbVie relies on patent, trademark, and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of its products, and the expiration or loss of patent protection may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings. AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products to remain competitive, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient to cover substantial research and development costs. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. The manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols, and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch may have to be discarded, leading to increased costs and lost revenue. AbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. AbbVie carries business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier. Significant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition. AbbVie is subject to product liability claims and lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations. The company is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. Possible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations, refunds, recalls, or seizures of AbbVie's products, and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. The international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline. AbbVie intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations, or by issuing additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers. AbbVie believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements, and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.

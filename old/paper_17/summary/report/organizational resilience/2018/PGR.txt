Our business involves various risks and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives. Management divides these risks into categories, including operating risks stemming from external or internal events that may affect our insurance operations. Our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, which involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data and the projection of future trends. The realization of risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data, negatively affecting our underwriting profit margins and competitiveness. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we fail to establish accurate loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims. Catastrophes can be caused by natural events or other occurrences, and the frequency, severity, duration, and geographic location of such events are inherently unpredictable. Our success will depend on our ability to accurately predict our reinsurance needs and obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage. The highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry or the failure of one or more competitors, which may require us to absorb losses from failed insurers. Our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services is critical to maintaining our competitive position. Ongoing developments create significant levels of complexity in our products and systems, which may require us to modify our business practices and adopt new systems. We must accurately evaluate and pay claims made under our insurance policies, as failure to do so could undermine customer goodwill and our reputation. Our ability to attract, develop, and retain talent is critical to our success, and we must forecast sales and claims volume with reasonable accuracy to adjust our staffing levels accordingly. Our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments, and compliance with laws and regulations may result in increased costs that could adversely affect our profitability. Our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems, which could disrupt our ability to conduct operations and damage our reputation. Our business is highly dependent on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities and systems, and any interruption could impair our ability to perform critical functions. Efforts to develop new products or enter new areas of business may not be successful and could create enhanced risks. Our financial condition may be adversely affected if parties with which we transact business experience financial difficulties or default on obligations. Our access to capital markets and ability to obtain financing arrangements depend on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit agencies, and downgrades could adversely affect our operations. Our dividend policy may result in varying amounts being paid to shareholders, and changes in the insurance marketplace or our performance could adversely affect investor perceptions.

Due to external factors and opinions, law enforcement agencies may elect to no longer purchase our products, which could adversely affect our revenues. The success of our Axon Evidence software as a service delivery model is materially dependent on acceptance by law enforcement customers, and delays in securing widespread adoption could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products or features that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner. The development of new products is complex and time-consuming, and we may experience delays that could adversely affect our business and financial results. We face risks associated with rapid technological change and competing products, which could adversely affect our business. Defects in our products could reduce demand and result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance, and damage to our reputation. We devote significant resources to engineer secure products and ensure security vulnerabilities are mitigated, yet breaches could occur, resulting in unauthorized access to our data or our customers' data. A security breach could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and lead to legal liability. Interruptions in our service or loss of digital evidence may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers. Our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, which could result in claims, changes to our business practices, and increased costs. Most of our end-user customers are government agencies, which may experience budgetary and political constraints that could delay or prevent sales. Adverse publicity surrounding our products has previously lengthened our sales cycle. We may incur substantial selling costs and expend significant effort in connection with the evaluation of our products by potential customers before they place an order. Our reliance on third-party suppliers creates risks related to our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, which could significantly delay shipments and adversely affect our revenues. We are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment, which could result in significant liabilities and costs. Our international operations expose us to additional risks, including import and export requirements, tariffs, and trade disputes. We may consider additional acquisitions or joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy, which involve significant challenges and risks. Catastrophic events could disrupt our business, and our financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in currency values. Our future success depends on our ability to expand sales through distributors and direct sales, and our inability to recruit new distributors could negatively affect our sales. We are highly dependent on the services of our key management personnel, and the loss of their services could adversely impact our business. Our future success is also dependent on our ability to manage growth and increase manufacturing production capacity while maintaining product quality. We anticipate that a strategic shift towards subscription models will better match the municipal budgeting process of our customers and allow for multiple product offerings to be bundled into existing subscriptions. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements, including capital expenditures and working capital needs, through at least the next 12 months.

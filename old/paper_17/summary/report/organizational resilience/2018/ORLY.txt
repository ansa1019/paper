Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including deteriorating economic conditions that may adversely impact demand for our products and reduce access to credit. The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including general business conditions and consumer confidence, which are outside of our control. Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, negatively impacting our business and financial condition. Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, which could impact our costs and sales. Unusually inclement weather has historically discouraged customers from visiting our stores, while extreme weather conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of automotive parts. We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives, which are dependent on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions and general business conditions. Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel, and we must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. Our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers, and financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase or our ability to source products from them. We expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy, but acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations. Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory and process transactions, and disruptions could negatively impact revenue and our financial condition. We believe our company has built an excellent reputation in the automotive aftermarket industry, and our continued success depends on our ability to preserve and grow the value of our brand. Our liquidity and capital resources are influenced by our ability to generate cash flows from operations, which could be negatively impacted by decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to changing customer preferences, which reflects our adaptability in the face of market pressures. The preparation of our financial statements requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management, which could materially impact our financial condition. We utilize various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities, and our assumptions regarding claims experience and trends represent our judgment about future obligations. Changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations and changes in tax regulations. Our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations, and our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is influenced by external factors. Overall, we believe that our strategic initiatives, including our dual market strategy and focus on customer service, will support our resilience and adaptability in a competitive landscape.

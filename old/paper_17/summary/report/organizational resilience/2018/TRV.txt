The geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposures, which can be caused by various natural and man-made events, underscoring the unpredictability of future climate trends and the potential for increased frequency and severity of catastrophic events. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage catastrophe risk. The company seeks to manage its exposure to man-made catastrophic events, including terrorism and cyber events, which are difficult to model and less reliable. Our ability to adjust terms, including deductible levels, or to increase pricing to offset rising costs of catastrophes may be limited due to public policy considerations and the evolving political environment. The company's operations rely on the reliable and secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information, and disruptions to these systems could significantly impair our ability to perform necessary business functions. Business continuity can be disrupted by events that render large portions of the workforce unable to work, particularly at critical locations. If our business continuity plans do not sufficiently address potential interruptions, this could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business. The company continually refines its claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, and the legal, regulatory, and economic environment evolves. The company employs a conservative investment philosophy, focusing on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio to support its insurance operations. The company’s investment strategy is to achieve a mix of investments that balances long-term growth with near-term benefit payments. The company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models to manage its exposure to catastrophic events, employing various analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions. The company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur. The company expects that retention levels will remain strong by historical standards, and that renewal premium changes will remain positive. The company’s ability to manage its catastrophe exposure is influenced by regulatory actions and the competitive environment. The company’s overall view of the current underlying asbestos and environmental environment remains unchanged, with a high degree of uncertainty regarding future exposure to claims. The company believes that its reserves for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based on known facts, current law, and management's judgment, but uncertainties continue to exist. The company’s claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available, and changes in the legal, regulatory, and legislative environment may impact the resolution of claims and result in adverse loss reserve development. The company’s investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and changes in market conditions could materially affect its results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The company’s capital position is strong, and it expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to shareholders. The company’s liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, and investment income, and it believes that future liquidity needs will be adequately met from these sources.

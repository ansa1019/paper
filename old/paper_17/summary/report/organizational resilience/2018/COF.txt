This section highlights specific risks that could affect our business, including general economic and market risks, changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment, and the potential for adverse effects on our industry, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to recover debt may be limited, which could negatively impact our results of operations. The process and models we use to estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses may become less reliable if volatile economic conditions or changes in consumer behavior cause actual losses to diverge from projections. Disruptions in the capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability, while regulatory risk compliance may increase costs and limit business opportunities. Our operational, technological, and organizational infrastructure must adapt to rapid technological advances, and any failures in these systems could materially affect our business and reputation. We face risks related to operational and technological infrastructure, including reliance on third-party service providers, which may increase our risk exposure. Our ability to manage credit risk may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes, competitors' actions, and inadequate collections staffing. We continuously monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk, with key metrics including delinquency and nonperforming asset rates. Our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating risk exposures in all market environments, and we are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny, which can lead to public enforcement actions. Our risk framework, which includes governance processes, accountabilities, and risk appetites, is essential for managing risks across eight major categories, including compliance, credit, legal, liquidity, market, operational, reputation, and strategic risks. We recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern, and we manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues to strengthen our brand. Our liquidity risk management practices ensure we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves. We employ various techniques to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk, including the use of derivatives. Our primary source of market risk is interest rate risk, which is inherent in our operations. We continuously evaluate our risk management practices and adjust our methodologies to reflect changes in market conditions and borrower behavior. Our ongoing investments in infrastructure are necessary to maintain a competitive business and establish scalable operations. We also face risks from unpredictable catastrophic events, and while we have business contingency plans in place, there can be no assurance that these plans will fully mitigate all potential risks. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate skilled employees is critical to our success, and competition for talent is intense. We rely on our senior leaders not only for business success but also to lead with integrity, as their behavior significantly impacts our brand and reputation.

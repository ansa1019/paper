We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. Our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions, which can impact our ability to adapt and respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism may increase the cost of conducting business and contribute to political and economic unpredictability globally. A financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers, which in turn could harm our business and results of operations. Our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance and costs related to product defects, which may not result in additional net revenue. Rapid technological changes and shifts in customer requirements necessitate constant evaluation of our business model and strategy to ensure operational flexibility and adaptability. We are focused on providing solutions that enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative, which is critical for maintaining competitive advantage. Our executive management team must act quickly and with vision to meet rapidly changing customer expectations and technological advancements. We regularly acquire or invest in businesses and technologies that are complementary to our operations, which involves risks such as the difficulty of assimilating solutions and operations, and the potential for incompatible business cultures. Our dependency on international revenue exposes us to significant regulatory, economic, and political risks, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potential impact of catastrophic events, although there can be no assurance that these plans will enable us to return to normal business operations. Security incidents may compromise the integrity of our offerings and adversely impact our financial results, necessitating ongoing investments in security measures to protect our systems and data. Our strategy to digitize involves leveraging customer data to improve our offerings, which requires compliance with increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues. We rely on third parties for operational and technical services, and any security incidents involving these parties could expose us to liability and harm our reputation. We continually invest resources to update and improve our information technology systems to support our customers and ensure operational continuity. Our financial results fluctuate due to various factors, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the timing of customer renewals. We are committed to maintaining strong relationships with our distribution channels, as their financial stability directly affects our revenue generation capabilities. Our business strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which are essential for sustaining growth and resilience in a competitive landscape.

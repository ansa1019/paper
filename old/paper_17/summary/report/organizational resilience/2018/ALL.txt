In addition to the normal risks of business, significant risks and uncertainties apply to us as an insurer, investor, and provider of other products and financial services. Catastrophes and severe weather events may subject property and casualty businesses to significant losses, and our property and casualty business may be exposed to catastrophic events caused by various factors, some of which may be exacerbated by climate change. Our catastrophe management strategy is designed to address our exposure to catastrophes nationwide, and we continuously seek to limit or not offer new homeowners, manufactured home, and landlord package policy business in certain coastal geographies. We have continued to take actions to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events while meeting the needs of our customers. Our ability to effectively manage claims and claims expenses is influenced by our operational flexibility and the implementation of various loss management programs. We employ a risk management framework and a supporting system of internal controls to mitigate exposures and regularly conduct assessments and measurements of key supporting controls. The accuracy of our catastrophe models may be negatively impacted by changing climate conditions, and we are exposed to assessments from various state-created insurance facilities. Our catastrophe management programs have historically been financed from operating cash flows, and our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe or multiple catastrophes, resulting in extraordinary losses. We utilize various methods to measure and monitor risks, including stochastic methods and scenario analysis, to assess the potential impact of extreme but plausible insurance-related events. We manage financial risk through enterprise risk and return management practices, ensuring that our capital position exceeds economic targeted levels. Our risk-return principles guide decision-making around risk and return, focusing on protecting solvency and acting with integrity. We regularly identify, measure, monitor, and report significant risks, including insurance, financial, investment, operational, and strategic risks. Our operational risk management addresses loss resulting from failures in people, processes, systems, and culture, including cybersecurity risks. We depend heavily on computer systems to perform necessary business functions and are exposed to the risk of cyberattacks and unauthorized access, which could impair our ability to conduct business effectively. The occurrence of a disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, particularly if those events affect our computer-based data processing systems. We have implemented various security measures to protect our data and systems, and we continuously enhance our cybersecurity program to be resilient against emerging threats. Our enterprise risk management framework provides a comprehensive view of risks and is used by senior management to drive strategic and business decisions. We believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available methodologies, facts, technology, laws, and regulations. The establishment of appropriate reserves requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate. Our claims and claims expense reserves include estimates of losses from reported claims and incurred but not reported claims, and we regularly update our reserve estimates based on actual claims experience. We conduct an annual review to evaluate and establish reserves for asbestos, environmental, and other discontinued lines, using established industry practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment.

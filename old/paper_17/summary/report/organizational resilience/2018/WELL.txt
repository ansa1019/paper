This section discusses the most significant factors that affect our business, operations, and financial condition, which could materially adversely affect our ability to continue paying dividends at the current rate. Our investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations, exposing us to risks associated with real estate investments, including the inability to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations. We monitor our investments through various methods determined by the type of property, including reviewing monthly financial statements and other operating data, property inspections, and creditworthiness assessments. Our asset management process aims to intervene early to address negative trends and support the collectability of revenue and the value of our investments. We are exposed to operational risks that could adversely affect our revenue and operations, including fluctuations in occupancy, economic conditions, and competition. Decreases in our operators' revenues or increases in their expenses could affect their ability to make payments to us, necessitating reliance on the credit of our operators and the value of collateral. We cannot assure that our operators will achieve and maintain occupancy levels that enable them to meet their obligations to us. The insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, or managers may adversely affect our business and financial condition, as we are exposed to risks that may not be present with other ownership methods. Our ability to acquire properties may be limited by cash, available borrowing capacity, or other capital resources, which could force us to sell our interests in joint ventures when we would prefer to retain them. We are also subject to various operational risks that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, including regulatory compliance and the availability of labor. The risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, particularly in the seniors housing and health care industries, could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell them. Our success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, and losing any key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments and maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected by various risks, including operational difficulties experienced by our obligors. We depend on the ability of our operators to manage properties efficiently and effectively, and any adverse developments in their business or financial condition could impair their ability to do so. We also face risks associated with international operations, including compliance with foreign laws and regulations and political and economic instability. The dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services may impact our operations and financial condition. Our operators' failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect their operations and ability to meet obligations to us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from tax examinations and other matters, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.

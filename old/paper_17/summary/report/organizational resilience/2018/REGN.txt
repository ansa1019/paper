We operate in an environment that involves a number of significant risks and uncertainties that could affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. We are substantially dependent on the success of Eylea, which represents a substantial portion of our revenues, making us reliant on that product. The continued commercial success of our marketed products will depend on various factors, including the effectiveness of our commercial strategy, maintaining sales in the face of competitive products, and our ability to meet demand for commercial supplies. We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, and failure to maintain regulatory compliance could materially harm our business. Serious complications or unexpected side effects in connection with our marketed products could also materially harm our business. Sales of our marketed products are dependent on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, and changes to such reimbursement may adversely affect our business. We face substantial competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and many of our competitors have greater capabilities and resources. Our ability to generate and grow sales will depend on the extent to which our distributors and specialty pharmacies can provide adequate distribution of our products. We have limited commercial capabilities outside the United States and would need to develop or outsource these capabilities, which could create substantial new risks to the successful commercialization of our products. We rely on collaborations with Bayer and Sanofi for the commercialization of Eylea and other products, and if these collaborations are terminated or if we fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, our business could be materially impaired. Our manufacturing capacity is limited, and we rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies. If we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with these parties, our business could be materially harmed. We are dependent on key personnel, and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our organizations, our business will be harmed. Our operations are increasingly dependent on complex information technology systems, and disruptions or breaches could adversely affect our business. We expect continued increases in our expenditures, particularly in connection with our research and development activities, and the amount of funding required will depend on various factors, including the results of our clinical programs and the continuation of collaborations. We believe that our existing capital resources and anticipated revenues will enable us to meet our projected operating needs for the foreseeable future. However, the potential for significant changes in regulatory requirements, competition, and other external pressures could impact our ability to maintain operational continuity and achieve our major objectives. The complexity of our manufacturing processes and reliance on external suppliers may also pose risks to our operational resilience.

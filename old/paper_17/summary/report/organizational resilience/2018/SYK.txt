This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of our products, and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals can be costly and time-consuming. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including substantial fines and product recalls. We are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices, and we are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters. Our reliance on certain suppliers exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices, which could adversely impact our competitive position. We operate in a highly competitive industry where competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant. Our ability to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals is crucial for the development, marketing, and selling of new and improved products. We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions, as such investments are inherently risky and may not yield the expected benefits. We may experience loss of market share, additional expense, and harm to our reputation due to interruptions in manufacturing operations. We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business, and numerous cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems and data. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, and business harm. We are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system, and any disruptions or deficiencies in this implementation could adversely affect our operations. Our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to access capital markets at competitive rates. We maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations and overall cost of capital. We believe our financial condition allows us to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from various sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. We anticipate being able to manage risks associated with our extensive international operations, including changes in reimbursement and regulatory requirements. Our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on complex income tax regulations, and we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Future changes in judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets could result in significantly different estimates of fair values, potentially impacting our results of operations.

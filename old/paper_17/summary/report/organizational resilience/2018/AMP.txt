Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including market fluctuations and economic, political, and other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These factors can impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives and may lead to declines in U.S. and global market conditions, which have historically affected our businesses. We have been adversely impacted by capital market and credit crises, equity market volatility, and economic downturns, which may affect our clients' activities and our revenues. Our financial condition is largely dependent on the level and mix of assets under management, which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions and client activity. Downturns in equity markets can adversely affect revenues and returns from our asset management services, and general regulatory or economic uncertainty may cause potential purchasers to limit or refrain from purchasing our products. We have hedged a portion of guarantees for variable annuity contracts to mitigate financial losses from market declines, although there can be no assurance that such hedging will fully protect profitability. Poor investment performance could impair revenues and earnings, and clients may terminate relationships with us or reduce managed assets for various reasons, including investment performance and changes in market conditions. Our ability to attract and retain qualified individuals is critical for our success, as we depend on a network of advisors to drive growth. The impairment or negative performance of other financial institutions could adversely affect us, as we have exposure to various industries and counterparties. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may limit our access to necessary capital and affect our liquidity needs. We believe that our liquidity needs are satisfied through reserves and cash generated by operations, although we may need to access financing sources if current resources are insufficient. Our financial strength ratings are crucial for maintaining public confidence in our products and competitive position, and a downgrade could significantly impact our financial condition. We face intense competition in the financial services industry, which could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase market share and profitability. The regulatory environment is uncertain, and changes may impose additional costs or operational challenges. Our operational systems are subject to cybersecurity risks, which could result in the loss of confidential information and damage to our reputation. We have developed a comprehensive business continuity plan to address potential disruptions, but inherent limitations exist. Our risk management policies may not fully mitigate exposure in all market environments, and errors or misconduct by employees could harm our business. The establishment of reserves for future policy benefits and claims is an estimation process that involves significant judgment and could lead to additional reserve requirements if actual experience deviates from estimates. Our operations in foreign markets expose us to exchange rate risks and regulatory challenges, which could adversely affect our business. The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could disrupt our operations and impact financial performance. Changes in laws and regulations may also affect our operations and profitability, and we must continually adapt to these evolving conditions to maintain organizational resilience.

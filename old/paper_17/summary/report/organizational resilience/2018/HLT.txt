We are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth. Our business is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks, including significant competition from multiple hospitality providers, changes in operating costs, and increases in costs due to inflation. Macroeconomic factors beyond our control can adversely affect demand for our products and services, including changes in general economic conditions, governmental action, and political instability. The hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility, which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition. Our revenues are closely linked to consumer demand and general economic conditions, which are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we generate. Our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties could be affected by various external pressures, including the financial condition of third-party property owners and developers. Our relationships with third-party owners, franchisees, and developers are critical to our operational effectiveness and growth. We depend on our long-term management and franchise contracts for a significant portion of our management and franchise fee revenues, and the success of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under these contracts. The hospitality industry is characterized by intense competition, and our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation. Changes in ownership or management practices, accidents, cyber-attacks, and natural disasters can harm our reputation and create adverse publicity. We are exposed to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications, including changes in required technology interfaces and security breaches. We rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions, and any loss or disruption in these services could adversely affect our business. Our business operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including those related to health, safety, and environmental standards, which could result in significant costs or liabilities. We are also subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us, which may adversely affect our financial results. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry. The loss of senior executives or key personnel could significantly harm our business, as could collective bargaining activity that disrupts operations or increases labor costs. Labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business, and increased minimum wage rates could further increase costs. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hospitality industry that may be beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain compliance with covenants in our debt agreements, which could result in an event of default. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain operational continuity is critical to our organizational resilience in the face of adversity.

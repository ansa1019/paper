The organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical to maintaining its operational continuity. Our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting healthcare costs and on our ability to manage future healthcare costs through medical management, product design, and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. We face pressure to contain premium rates, and our customers may renegotiate their contracts to seek to contain their costs or may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. Changes in healthcare practices, demographic characteristics, inflation, and new technologies may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage healthcare costs, as well as our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. Our reserves for health insurance policy benefits are based on assumptions concerning trends in healthcare costs, and unfavorable claims experience compared to these assumptions could increase incurred losses and adversely affect future earnings. We must identify, assess, and respond to new laws and regulations, as well as comply with various existing laws applicable to our business. Future regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products. We face competition in many of our markets, and if we fail to adapt to changes in our industry and develop strategic growth opportunities, our ability to compete and grow may be adversely affected. Our ability to profitably grow our business depends on not only growing our profitable medical membership but also diversifying our sources of revenue and earnings. We must respond to pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and potentially disruptive new entrants. The elimination of the individual mandate penalty may further disrupt the public exchange markets. We are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions. A termination of our agreements with key vendors could result in service disruptions or unavailability, which could adversely affect our business. We have contingency plans and insurance coverage for potential liabilities, but these may not be sufficient to cover all claims. Cybersecurity and the development of controls to protect our systems remain a priority, as we are regularly targeted by cyber attacks. Our participation in government-sponsored programs exposes us to risks associated with dependence on government funding and compliance with government contracts. Changes in government regulations could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We continually evaluate our accounting policies and estimates, especially concerning liabilities for medical claims payable, which are influenced by various factors including utilization levels and unit costs. Our investment strategy is designed to minimize financial risk while maximizing long-term returns, and we are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. We manage our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the constraints of our financial strategy, and our liquidity position is influenced by various factors including profitability and operating cash flows. The regulatory environment and market conditions may impact our ability to maintain financial flexibility and liquidity, which are essential for our organizational resilience.

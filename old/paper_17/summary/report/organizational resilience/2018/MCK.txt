The healthcare industry in the United States has changed significantly in recent years in an effort to enhance efficiencies, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes. These changes have included cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, changes in the basis for payments, and shifting towards value-based payments and risk-sharing models. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to evolve, which may require us to adapt our business strategies to maintain operational flexibility and resilience. Our business operations could be affected by disruptions in our supply of generic drugs, which could significantly reduce our revenues and net income. The majority of our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business agreements are structured to ensure that we are appropriately compensated for the services we provide, and failure to renew these contracts could adversely impact our results of operations. The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation could impose increased costs, negatively impact our profit margins, delay the introduction of new products, or expose us to litigation. We are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, which could result in investigations or penalties that may harm our business. Our profit margins may be adversely affected by laws reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and related services. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in trade protection laws and regulatory requirements affecting our foreign operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit may contribute to instability in global political institutions and financial markets, which could adversely affect our business. We have developed contingency plans to address public health issues, but there can be no assurance that these plans will effectively mitigate negative impacts on our operations. Our business relies on sophisticated computer systems, and a failure or compromise of these systems could result in significant operational and financial consequences. We continuously monitor our operational risks and implement strategies to enhance our resilience against potential disruptions. Our restructuring initiatives aim to optimize our operating models and cost structures, which may involve workforce reductions and facility consolidations. We expect to incur charges related to these initiatives, which could impact our financial results. The integration of acquisitions involves significant risks, including potential operational disruptions and the realization of anticipated synergies. We must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans that rely on third-party providers, and if these vendors fail, we could incur revenue losses and liabilities. Our ability to adapt and respond to environmental disruptions is critical to maintaining our organizational resilience and ensuring long-term success. We must also navigate the complexities of our supply chain and customer relationships, particularly in light of the competitive landscape and ongoing market volatility.

The company faces risks that could materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, or financial condition, particularly in the context of acquisitions and dispositions. The integration of acquired businesses, such as the proposed acquisition of JLT, poses challenges that may impact operational continuity and the achievement of anticipated revenue or profitability targets. Difficulties in retaining key colleagues and clients, implementing business plans, and managing unexpected operating difficulties could hinder the company's ability to adapt and maintain performance under pressure. The company is also subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, which could divert management resources and impact organizational health. Regulatory investigations and inquiries may consume management time and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations. The company’s ability to recover from disasters or business continuity problems is critical, as such events could lead to material financial loss, loss of human capital, and reputational harm. The risk of business disruption is heightened in major metropolitan centers where the company has significant operations. The company regularly assesses and improves its business continuity and disaster recovery plans, but a significant event could materially interrupt operations and result in financial loss. The company relies on a large number of vendors and third parties for critical functions, and any failure by these entities could disrupt operations and impact the delivery of services. The competitive landscape necessitates effective responses to digital disruption and technological change, as failure to innovate could adversely affect the company’s competitive advantage. The company’s success in strategic initiatives, including investments in technology, is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changing market conditions. The company emphasizes the importance of a positive corporate culture and the retention of key personnel to ensure effective organizational functioning. The loss of senior management or key colleagues could limit the company’s ability to execute its business strategy. The evolving needs of clients and economic conditions may reduce demand for consulting services, impacting revenues and profitability. The company’s operations are also influenced by external pressures, including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes, which could affect the demand for services and operational effectiveness. The company’s financial flexibility may be adversely affected by its significant debt obligations, and its ability to respond to changing market conditions is critical for sustaining performance. The company’s defined benefit pension plans and associated obligations are sensitive to market conditions, and fluctuations in funding levels could impact financial results. The company’s global operations expose it to various risks, including currency fluctuations and compliance with diverse legal and regulatory frameworks. The company’s ability to maintain resilience in the face of these challenges is essential for its long-term success and sustainability.

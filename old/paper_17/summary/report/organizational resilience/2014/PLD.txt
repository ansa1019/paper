Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, distributable cash flow, and value of our securities. We are subject to social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries, which include difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations, differing employment practices, and local business factors. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform; however, if we are unable to manage the risks associated with our global business or operational fluctuations, our financial condition could be harmed. We are also impacted by the ability of our non-United States subsidiaries to transfer cash among subsidiaries, which may be restricted by currency exchange control regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences. 

Our global growth subjects us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We are exposed to general economic conditions and other events that affect areas where our properties are geographically concentrated, which may impact our financial results. Our investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk, and while we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification and market research, they cannot be eliminated. 

We have pursued growth opportunities in international markets and expect to continue to do so, despite potential adverse effects from economic instability and political uncertainty. Our organizational practices include evaluating our earthquake insurance coverage annually and maintaining adequate insurance for properties located in areas subject to natural disasters. We believe our properties are adequately insured; however, certain losses may not be fully covered, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our ability to generate cash from operating activities and available financing sources is considered adequate to meet anticipated future development, acquisition, and operating requirements. We expect to fund our cash needs principally from property operations, fees earned for services performed on behalf of co-investment ventures, and proceeds from the disposition of properties. Our liquidity requirements may necessitate alternative ways to increase liquidity, which could adversely affect our financial condition. 

We are also exposed to potential impacts from future climate change and climate-related risks, which may include physical risks from catastrophic weather events. Our organizational resilience is reflected in our ability to adapt to changing conditions, manage risks effectively, and maintain operational continuity. Our strategic initiatives focus on maintaining control of well-positioned land and creating value through development, which is essential for our long-term success in a competitive landscape.

We face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our ability to maintain profitability over the long term is dependent upon our ability to introduce new and improved vehicle models that attract consumers. The automotive industry is highly competitive, and our future competitiveness depends on our ability to control costs through successful restructuring initiatives. Disruptions in our suppliers' operations could disrupt our production schedule, as our automotive operations are dependent upon the timely delivery of systems, components, raw materials, and parts. Our use of "just-in-time" manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory quantities, making us vulnerable to supply disruptions. We are continuing to implement cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives, but external factors, such as interest rates and return on investments, may materially affect our ability to reduce costs. We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess manufacturing capacity, and attempts by competitors to sell more vehicles could negatively impact our pricing and market share. Our business plan includes restructuring operations in various countries, which may require us to impair or rationalize these operations. The success of our strategic actions will depend on our ability to execute and external economic factors. We are subject to extensive governmental regulations that can increase costs related to vehicle production and affect our product portfolio. The enforcement of these regulations may significantly affect our plans for global product development and could result in substantial costs. Our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded, and funding requirements could increase significantly due to various factors, including weak performance of financial markets and changes in assumptions. We are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could materially affect our operations. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic conditions, requiring us to maintain strong relationships with joint venture partners. We continue to strategically assess our operations in various regions, focusing on product portfolio enhancements, manufacturing footprint rationalization, and cost structure improvements. Our future funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans depend on the performance of assets placed in trusts, interest rates, and changes in government laws. We are committed to meeting or exceeding regulatory requirements, which may require significant investments in hybrid and electric vehicles. Our liquidity plans are subject to risks and uncertainties, including macroeconomic conditions that could limit our ability to execute business plans. We believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and availability under revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. Our future uses of cash include capital expenditures, payments associated with vehicle recalls, and payments for restructuring activities. We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our balance sheet and competitive position over the long term, including potential acquisitions and strategic alliances.

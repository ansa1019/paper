Our business is subject to many risks, including competitive and reputational risks that could adversely affect our organizational health and relationships with our guests and team members. We must continue to preserve, grow, and leverage the value of our reputation, as negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence. The retail business is highly competitive, and our ability to create a personalized guest experience is critical for differentiation. Our omnichannel retailing efforts are complex and require us to anticipate and meet changing guest expectations. If we fail to effectively execute these efforts, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We are increasingly reliant on technology investments to support our omnichannel efforts, and the returns on these investments are less predictable than traditional store expansions. Disruptions in our computer systems could adversely affect our operations and guest confidence, particularly in light of past data breaches that negatively impacted our sales and ability to handle customer inquiries. Our fulfillment network is becoming increasingly complex, and interruptions could lead to merchandise out-of-stocks and delivery delays, adversely affecting guest confidence and results of operations. We also face external pressures from macroeconomic conditions, which could negatively impact our sales growth and overall performance. Our workforce management is crucial, as our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified team members directly affects our operations and guest service levels. We are exposed to legal, regulatory, and other external risks, including potential changes in laws that could increase our costs and reduce our margins. Our exit from Canadian operations represents a strategic shift, and we must manage the associated risks and uncertainties effectively. We continually assess our operational capabilities and the potential impact of environmental disruptions, including natural disasters, which could significantly affect our results. Our financial position is also susceptible to changes in consumer confidence and economic conditions, which could lead to reduced sales and profitability. We maintain a program to detect and respond to data security incidents, but the evolving nature of these threats presents ongoing challenges. Our ability to manage risks effectively and maintain operational continuity is essential for organizational resilience. We must also ensure compliance with various regulations, as noncompliance could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our adaptability and responsiveness to market changes, ensuring that we can confront challenges and leverage opportunities for growth. The complexity of our operations requires ongoing evaluation of our resource allocation and management strategies to maintain performance under pressure and achieve our major objectives.

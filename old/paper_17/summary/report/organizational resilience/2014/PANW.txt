Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those related to managing growth and improving systems and processes, which are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and organizational resilience. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, operational systems, and processes to manage future growth effectively. Failure to implement these improvements could disrupt existing customer relationships and limit our ability to manage growth, forecast revenue, and prevent losses. Our productivity and the quality of our products may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train new employees effectively. We have experienced significant growth in our employee headcount and customer base, which adds complexity to our organization and requires effective coordination. Our operating results are likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could adversely affect our financial condition. We face intense competition in our market, necessitating continuous innovation and differentiation of our products to maintain a competitive advantage. Our ability to attract and retain new customers is influenced by various external pressures, including changes in market needs and competitive landscape dynamics. Additionally, we rely on third-party manufacturers for product supply, which exposes us to risks related to manufacturing and logistics delays that could disrupt our operations. We must effectively manage our supply chain and inventory to avoid lost sales opportunities or increased costs. Our corporate culture fosters innovation and teamwork, which are essential for sustaining organizational resilience as we grow. We have implemented a corporate structure aligned with our international business activities to enhance operational efficiencies and reduce our effective tax rate. However, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits from this structure, our financial condition may be adversely affected. We must also address potential risks associated with our reliance on channel partners for product sales, as their performance directly impacts our ability to distribute products effectively. Our future success depends on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions and customer needs, which requires ongoing investment in research and development, sales, and marketing. We are committed to enhancing our product portfolio and expanding our installed customer base while managing the associated risks and challenges. Our cash flow from operations is critical for supporting our business growth, and we must ensure that we can respond to business challenges effectively. The complexity of our operations necessitates ongoing evaluation and improvement of our internal systems and controls to maintain organizational resilience and operational continuity.

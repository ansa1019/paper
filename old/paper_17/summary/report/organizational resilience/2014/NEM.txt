Our business activities are subject to significant risks, including those related to fluctuating gold and copper prices, which can materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical, as a substantial or extended decline in commodity prices could reduce revenues, halt or delay the development of new projects, and limit funds available for exploration. We must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term, and exploration is highly speculative, often unsuccessful, and involves many uncertainties. Our operational flexibility is vital for adapting to environmental perturbations and external pressures, which can impact our competitive advantage. The management of our project portfolio is designed to maintain flexibility to address development risks, including permitting and community support, which are essential for sustaining operations. Our vision is to be recognized for exceptional economic, environmental, and social performance, which requires strategic initiatives and resilience strategies to navigate challenges. We have implemented a management system to promote continuous improvement in health and safety, environmental performance, and community relations, which are integral to our organizational health. The pressures from public scrutiny regarding environmental and social impacts necessitate a proactive approach to crisis management and stakeholder engagement. Our ability to operate effectively is contingent upon maintaining good relationships with employees and contractors, as labor disputes or disruptions could adversely affect production. The exploration and development of mining operations involve a high level of uncertainty, influenced by risks outside our control, such as environmental hazards and political risks. Our operations are also affected by energy shortages and water availability, which are critical for sustaining production. The need for operational continuity and strategic adaptation to changing conditions is paramount for organizational survival. We face intense competition for acquiring attractive mining properties and must navigate complex regulatory environments that can impact our operational capabilities. The ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes is essential for our organizational resilience, as is the capacity to innovate and adapt in response to unexpected situations. Our financial resources and strategic response mechanisms are designed to mitigate risks and enhance our resilience in a volatile market environment. The integration of advanced technologies and the development of human capital are crucial for fostering organizational learning and agility, enabling us to thrive amidst uncertainty and complexity.

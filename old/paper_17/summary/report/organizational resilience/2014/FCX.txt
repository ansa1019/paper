Financial risks, including declines in market prices of commodities such as copper, gold, and oil, could adversely affect earnings, cash flows, and asset values, potentially impacting the ability to repay debt. Fluctuations in commodity prices can arise from complex factors beyond control, including global supply and demand balances, economic conditions, and regulatory policies. A substantial decline in market prices could necessitate revisions to operating plans, including curtailing production and reducing capital expenditures.

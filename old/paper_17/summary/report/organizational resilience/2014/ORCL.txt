We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Economic, political, and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. Our business is influenced by a range of factors beyond our control, including general economic and business conditions, overall demand for enterprise software, governmental budgetary constraints, and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Macroeconomic developments like the continued slow pace of economic recovery could negatively affect our operating results and outlook. Any general weakening of corporate confidence in the global economy could cause customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets, which could lead to delays or cancellations of purchases of our products and services. We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors, leading to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. We use a pipeline system to forecast sales, but these estimates can prove unreliable, particularly during economic slowdowns. A substantial portion of our new software licenses revenue contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter, and a significant percentage of these are larger orders, which increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results. Our cloud computing strategy may not be successful, and we may not be able to compete effectively or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. The increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models may unfavorably impact pricing and overall demand for our on-premise software products. We have invested significantly in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new offerings, which are essential to maintaining our competitive position. Our success depends on our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products, and enhance existing offerings. Rapid technological advances and evolving customer needs characterize the industries in which we compete. Our hardware systems business may adversely affect our overall profitability if we do not effectively manage the associated risks, including potential write-downs and impairments of inventory. We are also subject to various legal proceedings that can divert management's attention and resources. Our international operations expose us to additional risks, including compliance with international laws and regulations, which can increase our cost of doing business. We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage difficulties. We continually focus on improving our cost structure and may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefits of a more efficient workforce structure. Our ability to manage our relationships with third-party manufacturers is crucial, as disruptions could impair our ability to fulfill orders. We have simplified our supply chain processes, but this has made us more dependent on fewer manufacturing partners, increasing our vulnerability to production problems. Our mixed direct and indirect sales model for our hardware systems products may not succeed, and disruptions to our software indirect sales channel could affect our future operating results. We are also susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers.

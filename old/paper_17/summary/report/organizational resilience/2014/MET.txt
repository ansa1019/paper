Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility, and disruptions in global capital markets can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. Disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. The financial markets have also been affected periodically by concerns over U.S. fiscal policy. Concerns about global economic conditions, capital markets, and the solvency of certain EU member states have caused elevated levels of market volatility. The sustained low interest rate environment has contributed to the underfunding of pension plans, which limits our customers' ability to engage in full pension plan closeout terminations. We expect that customers may choose to close out portions of pension plans over time, at costs reflecting current interest rates and availability of capital. Our diversified business mix and geographically diverse business operations partially mitigate these risks, although correlation across regions, countries, and global market factors may reduce the benefits of diversification. We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risks which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and may cause our net investment income to vary from period to period. We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset-liability management principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our investment strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities and utilizing derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk. The sustained low interest rate environment has driven lower investment yields on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar resulting from our holdings of non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, and net income from foreign operations. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the level of claim losses we incur. Our business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems, and failures in these systems could result in significant interruptions in our operations and adversely affect our business and financial results. We employ various strategies to manage risks, including the use of derivatives, reinsurance, and other risk management actions. Our liquidity management includes maintaining a substantial short-term liquidity position and managing our level of liquid assets. We believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates. We actively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows on a proactive basis and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle. The payment of dividends and other distributions by our insurance subsidiaries is governed by insurance laws and regulations, which may impose restrictions on the payment of dividends. We have established various capital support commitments and guarantees with certain of our subsidiaries to ensure they meet specified capital and surplus levels. We continuously monitor the capital markets for opportunities to adjust our liability coverage and manage the risks associated with our products.

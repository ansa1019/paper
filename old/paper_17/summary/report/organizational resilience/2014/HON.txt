Our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near and long term. Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services. The operational results of our business units are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns. The operating results may be affected by downturns in global demand, regulatory changes, and consumer demand. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers' inability to scale production during times of volatile demand. We seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, which may include consolidation of manufacturing facilities and transitions to cost-competitive regions. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in highly competitive markets. We monitor both suppliers and customers for signs of liquidity constraints, limiting exposure to any resulting inability to meet delivery commitments or pay amounts due. We continue to invest for future growth, including research and development targeted at high growth areas and capital expenditures related to the construction and expansion of manufacturing facilities. Our operational excellence and ability to expand profit faster than sales growth is due in part to a consistent application of key internal business processes that drive improvements in organizational efficiency and service quality. We are focused on driving profitable growth through technological excellence and optimized manufacturing capability to deliver innovative products that customers value. We also aim to expand margins by maintaining and improving our cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements. Our operational flexibility is enhanced through effective working capital management, enabling us to undertake strategic actions to benefit the business. We recognize that external pressures, including geopolitical instability and regulatory changes, can impair our flexibility in modifying strategies for growing our businesses. Our commitment to operational continuity and crisis management is evident in our comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, and address cybersecurity threats, which could disrupt business operations and adversely impact our reputation. We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio to ensure they fit our long-term strategic plan and identify business units that will benefit from increased investment. Our ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is critical to our survival and growth. We maintain a focus on strategic initiatives, including the identification of appropriate acquisition targets and the deployment of disciplined integration processes. Our organizational practices are designed to enhance our adaptability and resilience in the face of environmental disruptions and market volatility. We believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs, and we actively manage our liquidity through a combination of cash balances, committed credit lines, and access to public debt and equity markets.

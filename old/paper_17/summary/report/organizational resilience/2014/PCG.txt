PG&E Corporation's and the utility's financial results are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results, and are often beyond their control. The utility's ability to manage its operating expenses is crucial for maintaining its authorized rate of return in a timely manner. The outcomes of regulatory proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the utility's reputation and the regulatory and political environments. The utility's relationship with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) may be negatively affected by ongoing enforcement proceedings, which could increase the risk of adverse regulatory outcomes. The utility's ability to recover costs is contingent upon its compliance with regulatory requirements, which may impose additional operational constraints. The utility must manage various sources of electricity and natural gas, adhering to principles of prudent administration and regulatory compliance. The utility's financial results could be materially affected if actual costs differ from authorized or forecast costs, particularly in the face of unanticipated events such as storms or regulatory changes. The utility's operational flexibility is vital for adapting to unexpected situations and maintaining service continuity. The utility's ability to recover its costs is also impacted by economic conditions and customer demand fluctuations, which can create pressures on its financial performance. The utility's reputation continues to suffer from negative media coverage, which may undermine investor confidence and affect its ability to execute its business strategy. The utility's operational and information technology systems are critical for its functioning and must be resilient against disruptions, including cyber-attacks and natural disasters. The utility's business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor a large number of complex tasks and transactions daily. The occurrence of catastrophic events could interrupt fuel supplies, affect demand for electricity or natural gas, and result in significant costs that may not be recoverable through rates or insurance. The utility's ability to recover costs incurred in connection with third-party claims or litigation is also a critical factor in its financial health. The utility's operational management must continuously assess its capital expenditures and the related regulatory proceedings, as further charges could be required in future periods. The utility's success depends on maintaining a qualified workforce and satisfactory collective bargaining agreements, as labor disruptions could negatively impact its operations. The utility's financial results could be materially affected by the outcomes of pending investigations and enforcement matters, including the potential imposition of fines and the ability to recover costs associated with natural gas matters. The utility's operational resilience is tested by external pressures, including environmental regulations and the need to adapt to climate change impacts, which could affect its financial condition and operational capabilities. The utility's strategic initiatives must focus on enhancing its resilience to navigate complex regulatory environments and maintain operational continuity amidst challenges.

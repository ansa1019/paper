Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our ordinary shares. The acquisition of LSI and the integration of its business, operations, and employees involves risks, and failure to integrate successfully in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results. The integration of the LSI business will be complex and time-consuming, involving additional expense and could disrupt our business and divert management's attention from ongoing business concerns. Challenges include preserving customer, supplier, and other important relationships, improving operating margins, coordinating operations in new regions, integrating financial forecasting and controls, and maintaining employee morale. Our ability to realize benefits from the acquisition depends on the timely integration and consolidation of organizations, operations, facilities, procedures, policies, and technologies. The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers, and the demands or loss of significant customers may adversely affect our business. Adverse global economic conditions could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, characterized by significant downturns, rapid technological change, and fluctuations in product supply and demand. We are dependent on a small number of markets, including the mobile handset market, which is volatile and characterized by short product life cycles and fluctuations in demand. Our business is also subject to lengthy, competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expense. Competition in our industry could prevent us from growing our revenue and from raising prices to offset increases in costs. Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. We rely on third-party manufacturers for critical components, and any failure of these manufacturers to perform could adversely affect our ability to bring products to market. We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, which makes us highly reliant on third-party foundry capacity. A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities or significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are also in the process of relocating our U.S. corporate headquarters, which could require us to incur significant expenses and may cause disruptions. Our cash flows from operations are dependent on various factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and timing of payments. We have made significant investments in research and development to improve existing and develop new technologies to keep pace with technological advances and remain competitive. Our success depends on our ability to retain, attract, and motivate qualified personnel, especially design and technical personnel. We are subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. Our business is subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations. Social and environmental responsibility regulations may make our supply chain more complex and adversely affect our relationships with customers. Our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance, which is based on assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties.

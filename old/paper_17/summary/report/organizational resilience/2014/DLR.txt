The occurrence of global economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. The U.S. and global economies have experienced unprecedented and challenging conditions, including high energy costs, geopolitical issues, and unstable global financial markets, which may impact our ability to access capital markets and meet liquidity requirements. Our substantial development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns, including recessions, as well as adverse developments in the corporate data center and technology industries. Any such slowdown could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or reduced demand for data center space. The development of new technologies or changes in industry practices could also reduce demand for our facilities or render tenant improvements obsolete. We may be unable to lease vacant or development space or renew leases, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our properties depend upon the demand for technology-related real estate, and a decrease in this demand would have a greater adverse effect on our business than if we owned a more diversified tenant base. We have developed detailed procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure they meet our financial and technical criteria. Our growth depends on external sources of capital, which are outside of our control, and our access to these sources depends on market conditions and the perception of our business prospects. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows for our properties is highly subjective and based on assumptions that could differ materially from actual results. We may be unable to successfully integrate and operate acquired properties or businesses, and our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms may be exposed to significant risks, including competition from other real estate investors. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our properties, and we depend on significant tenants whose financial condition may weaken due to economic conditions. Our properties are geographically concentrated, and negative changes in local economic conditions could materially adversely affect our performance. We face significant competition, which may decrease or prevent increases in occupancy and rental rates of our properties. We rely on third parties for internet connectivity, and any delays or disruptions in connectivity may adversely affect our operating results. Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service, and any failure to meet service commitments could subject us to liability and damage our reputation. We are also vulnerable to service failures of our third-party suppliers, which could harm our business. Our operations may be affected by environmental laws and regulations, and we may incur significant costs related to compliance with these laws. Additionally, we are subject to risks associated with investing in unfamiliar international markets, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The complexity of our operations and the need for effective management of our resources are critical for maintaining our organizational resilience in the face of these challenges.

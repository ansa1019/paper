Our capacity is largely driven by production factors such as facilities, data centers, and a trained workforce that require long-term investments and expense commitments which we cannot easily adjust in the short term. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability and we may be unable to generate positive cash flow from operations. We may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors that may result in increased costs. Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. We face cyber-security risks, including unauthorized use or disclosure of customer data, theft of proprietary information, and denial of service attacks. If any of these risks occur, our reputation may be harmed, our services may be perceived as not secure, and we may incur significant liabilities. Disruptions in our services could damage our customers' businesses, subject us to substantial liability, and harm our reputation and financial results. We currently serve our customers primarily using equipment managed by us and co-located in third-party data center facilities operated by several different providers located around the world. These centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, and we cannot rapidly switch to new data centers or move customers from one data center to another in the event of any adverse event. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers' confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information. We do not control or monitor the information that customers process in our services, and we have legal and contractual obligations to protect the confidentiality and appropriate use of customer data. We depend on our senior management team, and if we lose key employees or are unable to attract and retain the employees we need to support our operations and growth, our business could be harmed. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team and many key individual contributors. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, and if we fail to attract new personnel or retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed. Our ability to enhance our existing service, develop new applications, and promote our services for the development of custom applications depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, introduction, and market acceptance. We may not be able to effectively scale and adapt our technology to meet our customers' performance and other requirements. Our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to meet the expanding needs of our customers as their use of our services grows. We expect the number of users and transactions we manage to continue to grow, and we may not be successful in developing or implementing new technologies. Our business depends substantially on our existing customers purchasing additional subscriptions from us and renewing their subscriptions upon expiration of the subscription term. Any decline in customer additional purchases or renewals would harm our operating results. Our growth also depends in part on our ability to sell more subscriptions and additional professional services to our current customers. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, or fail to add more authorized users, our revenues may decline, and our operating results would be harmed. We recognize revenues from our subscription service over the subscription term, and downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results.

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and investors should consider various risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly and be unpredictable due to factors outside of our control, including demand for our products and services, timing of orders, inventory imbalances, and changes in market needs. Adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may adversely impact our business, as our operations depend on the overall demand for information technology and the economic health of our customers. Our reliance on revenue from subscriptions and support services may lead to fluctuations in revenue recognition, which could negatively affect our financial results. We face risks associated with international sales and operations, including economic or political instability in foreign markets, difficulties in enforcing contracts, and compliance with foreign regulations. Our ability to manage inventory effectively is crucial, as insufficient inventory may result in lost sales opportunities, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and pursue new opportunities. Competition for highly-skilled personnel is intense, and failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business. Our average sales prices may decline due to competitive pressures, which could reduce our gross profits. We rely significantly on third-party channel partners to generate revenue, and their failure to perform could limit our ability to sell products and services. We are exposed to risks related to product defects and vulnerabilities, which could harm our reputation and lead to financial liabilities. Our business is subject to risks from natural disasters and other catastrophic events that could disrupt operations and supply chains. We must continue to improve our systems and processes to manage growth effectively, as failure to do so could result in increased costs and harm our results of operations. Our ability to maintain profitability and continue revenue growth is critical, and any failure in this regard could materially affect our stock price. We are also subject to changes in tax rates and potential tax liabilities, which could impact our financial condition. Our future capital requirements will depend on various factors, including growth rate and market acceptance of our products. Our operating activities are our primary source of liquidity, and we must manage working capital effectively to support operations and growth. The complexity of our operations and reliance on third-party manufacturers expose us to risks that could disrupt our ability to fulfill orders. We must navigate the challenges posed by a rapidly evolving network security market, including technological advancements and changing customer needs, to maintain our competitive position.

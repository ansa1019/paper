In deciding whether to invest in AIG, it is essential to consider risk factors that could have a significant or material adverse effect on businesses, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. These factors are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, potentially exacerbating their impact. The organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical, particularly in the context of extreme market events that may lead to volatility, lack of liquidity, and erosion of investor confidence. AIG's businesses are highly dependent on the economic environment, and concerns beyond control, such as fiscal and monetary policy, could adversely affect liquidity and increase volatility. The organization actively manages risks through monitoring the accumulation of exposures and employing reinsurance, hedging, and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures. AIG recognizes the financial threat posed by climate change, which may impact catastrophe risk perception and pricing assumptions.

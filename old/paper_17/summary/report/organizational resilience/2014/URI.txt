Our business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which may impair our business operations. A slowdown in the economic recovery or a decrease in general economic activity could have adverse effects on our revenues and operating results. Our significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic developments and limiting our flexibility to react to such conditions. This could make it more difficult to pay or refinance our debts during periods of adverse economic conditions, thereby affecting our operational flexibility and financial health. We depend on cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we may have to adopt alternative strategies that could limit our growth and operational capabilities. 

Our growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets. Acquisitions entail certain risks, including the difficulty in assimilating operations and personnel, which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and suppliers. The operational and cost reduction strategies we pursue may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect, as their success depends on factors beyond our control. We have achieved significant cost savings through centralization of equipment purchases, but we depend on key suppliers and are exposed to their credit risks, which could impact our operational continuity.

Disruptions in our information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations. The security measures we employ may not prevent all attempts to compromise our systems, which could lead to increased costs and operational challenges. We are also subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations, and any compliance costs that are not currently anticipated could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. 

Our operations are exposed to various claims, and our insurance may not fully cover them, potentially leading to increased reserves and adversely impacting our financial condition. We also face risks associated with labor relations, including potential work stoppages or strikes that could disrupt our ability to serve customers. Fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business, as could trends in oil and natural gas prices, which directly affect the demand for our services. 

Our ability to comply with covenants in our debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments or alternative sources of financing. Our collective bargaining agreements could disrupt our operations or lead to higher labor costs. We are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers and any insolvency or financial difficulties on their part could adversely affect our business. The equipment rental industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge, impacting our resilience and operational effectiveness.

The risks described could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, including changes in the healthcare industry's pricing, selling, inventory, distribution, or supply policies, which could significantly reduce revenues and net income. Our business operations could be affected by external pressures such as changes in the regulatory environment, which may impose increased costs and negatively impact profit margins. The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and further regulation could expose the company to litigation and regulatory investigations, affecting operational continuity and resilience. We are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws relating to healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse, which could require changes in operations and lead to civil and criminal penalties. Our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers are subject to laws that could impose restrictions and affect our ability to operate effectively. The ongoing changes in the healthcare delivery models and reimbursement rates may impact our ability to maintain performance under pressure. Our business is also exposed to risks associated with foreign operations, including changes in trade laws and unexpected regulatory changes, which could disrupt operations and impact financial performance. We have developed contingency plans to address potential disruptions, but there can be no assurance that these plans will be effective. Our reliance on sophisticated information systems means that any malfunction or breach could have a material adverse impact on our operations. We must maintain disaster recovery and business continuity plans, and any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to fulfill contractual commitments. The integration of acquisitions involves significant risks, including the diversion of management's attention and difficulties in assimilating operations, which could adversely affect our growth strategies. The company is also subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings that could disrupt normal business operations and divert management's attention, potentially harming organizational effectiveness. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain operational flexibility is critical for organizational resilience. The company's future results could be materially affected by public health issues, which could disrupt operations and have a broader adverse impact on consumer spending. We continuously monitor outstanding receivables and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt, reflecting our commitment to maintaining organizational health. The successful management of divestitures and acquisitions is essential to achieving strategic objectives and maintaining competitive advantage in a turbulent market environment.

The continued uncertainty in the global economy may negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, highlighting the need for effective risk management and adaptability in response to external pressures. Weakness in the global economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and the growth of the semiconductor industry, causing companies to focus on costs, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase sales. Further economic instability could lead customers to postpone decisions or decrease spending, impacting our operational flexibility and overall performance. The increasing complexity of semiconductor designs and customer concerns about managing costs may lead to decreased design activity, which could adversely affect our financial condition. The semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems, necessitating inter-organizational collaboration to ensure compatibility and optimize our solutions with major foundries and third-party intellectual property. Our ability to innovate and introduce new products is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and responding effectively to market demands. Acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy, but they pose risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition if not managed properly. Consolidation among our customers may lead to fewer customers or increased bargaining power, impacting our revenue and financial health. We must successfully manage competitive factors, including technological shifts and customer demands for lower costs, to sustain our business. Our operations are subject to numerous risks, including compliance with evolving regulations, which could have material adverse effects on our financial condition. Catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and resilience strategies to maintain operational continuity. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales, exposing us to risks associated with global operations, including political tensions and compliance obligations. Our investment portfolio may be impaired by capital market deterioration, highlighting the need for effective resource management and risk assessment strategies. We must also navigate fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could impact our financial results. Our financial statements are affected by assumptions and estimates that may differ from actual results, underscoring the importance of accurate forecasting and adaptability in our financial planning. The complexity of our customer arrangements requires us to anticipate and respond to changing demands effectively, ensuring that we maintain our organizational resilience in a dynamic business environment.

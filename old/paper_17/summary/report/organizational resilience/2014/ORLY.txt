Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including deteriorating economic conditions that may adversely impact demand for our products and reduce access to credit. The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including general business conditions and consumer confidence, which could lead to decreased demand for our products. Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, which could impact our costs and sales. Unusually inclement weather has historically discouraged customers from visiting our stores, reducing sales, particularly to DIY customers. We believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives, which are dependent on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions and general business and economic conditions. Our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel, and we must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. A change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers could affect our financial health, as our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with suppliers. Economic conditions may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings and other unfavorable events for our customers and suppliers. Business interruptions in our distribution centers may affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory and process transactions, and any disruption could negatively impact revenue. Failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business. Our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs is critical, as our success depends on our ability to control costs while meeting labor needs. We have ongoing initiatives aimed at tailoring our product offering to adjust to customers' changing preferences, and we continue to focus on marketing and training to educate customers on the advantages of purchasing higher-quality products. The automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to expend more resources to remain competitive. Our liquidity and capital resources are influenced by our ability to generate funds from operations, which may be negatively impacted by decreased demand or changes in customer buying patterns. We expect to fund our commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business or through borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our long-term business strategy requires capital to open new stores, fund strategic acquisitions, and expand distribution infrastructure. We have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring inventory and have historically been successful in adjusting inventory volume in conjunction with demand. Our supplier financing programs enable us to reduce overall supply chain costs and negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. Our business involves the storage of personal information about customers and team members, and we have taken steps to protect this information. However, a significant data security breach could expose us to damage to our reputation and additional costs. We are involved in litigation arising from the ordinary course of our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Our success depends on our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain operational flexibility in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including adverse economic and market conditions that may adversely impact our customers' future spending as well as payment for our services, potentially affecting our operations and growth. The economic recovery from the recession has been gradual, and there is continuing uncertainty in the marketplace. Stagnant or declining economic conditions have adversely impacted the demand for our services in the past and may adversely affect us in the future. We believe that our financial and operational strengths will enable us to manage these challenges and uncertainties. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, influenced by seasonal variations, project timing, and customer spending patterns. Our business can be highly cyclical and subject to seasonal variations that can result in significant differences in operating results. We may encounter difficulties due to delays in designs, engineering information, or materials provided by customers or third parties, as well as delays from our customers' failure to obtain permits or meet regulatory requirements. A failure to manage and invest in our equipment fleet could negatively impact project performance and results. Our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by our capacity to expand the range of services we offer to customers, attract new customers, and address challenges presented by stringent regulatory requirements and difficult economic conditions. We cannot be certain that our strategies for achieving internal growth will be successful. The nature of our business exposes us to warranty claims, which may reduce our profitability. We may also be required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the resolution of claims is pending, which could adversely affect liquidity and financial results. Our business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees, which could impair our ability to maintain productivity and profitability. Our use of fixed-price contracts could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as actual revenues and project costs can vary significantly from our original projections. We are subject to significant operational hazards due to the nature of services provided, and if we are not fully insured against such risks, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply could result in significant liabilities. Our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected due to our union status, which may create additional liabilities or operational constraints. We are also subject to risks associated with our dependence on suppliers, subcontractors, and equipment manufacturers, which could expose us to operational risks. We believe that our strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaborations will enhance our resilience and adaptability in the face of external pressures and disruptive events. Our decentralized management structure may impact our ability to respond effectively to challenges, and we are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions may have on them. We continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions and investments to broaden our customer base and expand our geographic area of operation, which we believe will create opportunities for growth and enhance our organizational resilience.

Our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We depend heavily on a single customer, the U.S. government, for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in this customer's priorities and spending could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. The U.S. government is implementing significant reductions in spending, and we cannot predict the impact on existing or future programs. Significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs may negatively impact our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. The budget environment, including sequestration, remains a significant long-term risk, and considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold. We believe continued budget pressures will have serious negative consequences for the defense industrial base, including our company, and the customers, employees, suppliers, and communities that rely on us. Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including political and economic factors that may dramatically affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets. We face various cyber and other security threats, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and networks, which could lead to losses of sensitive information or capabilities and damage to our reputation. Our operations are also subject to environmental laws and regulations, and compliance with these laws may require significant operating and capital costs. Changes in regulations or political leadership may impact our ability to conduct business internationally. We are subject to various investigations, claims, and litigation that could divert financial and management resources and result in fines or penalties. Our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet customer needs. The occurrence of unforeseen problems, such as design issues or production challenges, could prevent us from meeting requirements and create significant risk. Our business is subject to disruption caused by natural and environmental disasters, which could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position. We endeavor to ensure the efficient conversion of operating income into cash for deployment in our business and to maximize shareholder value. We believe that our business is well-positioned in areas that the Department of Defense has indicated are key focuses for future defense spending, but the long-term impact of budget cuts remains uncertain. Our ability to perform our obligations could be adversely affected if subcontractors or suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon products or materials in a timely manner. We must rely on certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to develop new products and technologies or attract and retain a qualified workforce, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position. Our contracts often require innovative design capabilities and are technologically complex, and failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects.

There are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business, including intense price competition, aggressive expansion, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, and entry of non-traditional competitors. We have developed a strategic plan that provides a balanced approach to meet the wide-ranging needs and expectations of our customers in this challenging economic environment. Our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and vital to continuing operations. Difficulties in maintaining or operating existing systems could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations. Concerns regarding product safety could cause shoppers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, leading to a substantial and adverse effect on our reputation and financial condition. Our relationship with unions, including prolonged work stoppages, could have a material adverse effect on our results. We are a party to approximately 300 collective bargaining agreements, and if we cannot control health care, pension, and wage costs, we may experience increased operating costs. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical, particularly in the context of economic conditions that impact consumer spending. Our operational flexibility is essential for adapting to changes in the competitive landscape, including pricing and promotional activities. We recognize the need for effective crisis management and preparedness strategies to mitigate risks associated with labor relations and economic downturns. The integration of new business through mergers and acquisitions presents challenges, including the coordination of geographically separate organizations and unforeseen expenses. Our ability to achieve anticipated benefits from these integrations may be subject to significant uncertainties. We continue to evaluate our potential exposure to under-funded multi-employer pension plans, which could trigger substantial withdrawal liabilities if we cease contributions. Our capital investments are aimed at maintaining operational continuity and enhancing our competitive advantage. We expect to obtain sales growth from new square footage and increased productivity from existing locations. Our strategic initiatives are designed to address external pressures and enhance organizational resilience. We believe that our cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Our ability to respond effectively to economic conditions, including consumer confidence and spending, is crucial for maintaining our organizational health. The impact of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions could disrupt our operations, emphasizing the importance of resilience strategies. We continue to focus on maintaining market share by offering good prices and superior products and services, which reflects our commitment to organizational success. Our operational management practices are designed to foster adaptability and resourcefulness in the face of unexpected situations. We are committed to learning and evolving as an organization, ensuring that we can confront challenges and sustain our performance under pressure.

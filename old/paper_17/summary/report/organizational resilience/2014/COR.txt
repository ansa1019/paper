The healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation, which could give resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, potentially leading to greater pressure to reduce prices for products and services. Our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the United States and other countries where we do business; deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers, thereby reducing purchases by our customers and negatively affecting our revenue growth and profitability. The volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers. A disruption in our relationship with key customers, such as Walgreens, could adversely affect our business and financial results. If Walgreens' operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, it could adversely affect our business, sales, and profitability. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We have entered into arrangements with Walgreens and Alliance Boots with the expectation that these transactions will result in various benefits, including cost savings and operating efficiencies. However, achieving these anticipated benefits is subject to significant challenges and uncertainties, including the potential disruption of our plans and operations. Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability. Compliance with various federal and state laws and regulations may impose additional burdens on our operations. Natural disasters or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition. The occurrence of unexpected events, including severe weather, could result in physical damage to distribution centers and disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers. Our business relies on sophisticated information systems to manage data and facilitate operations; any interruption or failure of these systems could disrupt our business. Cybersecurity remains a priority, as breaches could damage our reputation and increase costs. We are subject to various risks inherent in global operations, including local political changes and economic environments. Our operations in jurisdictions outside the United States may be affected by changes in local laws and regulations. We have established reserves against amounts due from suppliers and maintain ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial conditions. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is vital for our organizational resilience. We must continue to develop plans to mitigate potential impacts of legislative and regulatory changes on our operations. Our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers expose us to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse, which could result in significant penalties if not complied with. The strategic initiatives we undertake, including acquisitions, must be managed carefully to ensure they align with our objectives and do not disrupt our operational flexibility. Our financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame.

Our business is subject to various industry, economic, regulatory, and other risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. The pharmacy benefit management (PBM) industry has been experiencing margin pressure due to competitive pressures and increased client demands for lower prices and enhanced service offerings. We maintain contractual relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers that provide for purchase discounts and rebates on drugs dispensed by pharmacies in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacies. If we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the discounts or rebates decline, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Competitive pressures have resulted in our clients sharing a larger portion of rebates and discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers, impacting our ability to offer plan sponsors competitive pricing. Changes in federal or state laws or regulations could also reduce the discounts we receive. Our retail pharmacy segment has been impacted by these margin pressures, including client demands for lower prices and network reimbursement pressure. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations to reduce prescription drug costs may impact our profitability. Increased utilization of generic pharmaceuticals has resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payments, causing a reduction in the generic profit rate. Our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition costs of generic pharmaceuticals has historically mitigated the effect of this trend, but significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry may enhance manufacturers' pricing power and diminish our negotiating ability. The health care industry has been subject to increased governmental regulation and audits, which may require extensive system and operating changes that could be difficult to implement. Untimely compliance with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations, including potential penalties and loss of government certifications. Our business is affected by the economy in general, including changes in consumer purchasing power and preferences. A worsening economic environment could cause a decline in drug utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management services. Our PBM business generates net revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services. The reputational impact of service-related incidents could negatively affect our ability to grow and retain our client base. The profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug products, which is affected by the introduction of new and successful pharmaceuticals as well as lower-priced generic alternatives. Many aspects of our operations depend on our information systems, which are subject to damage or interruption from various threats. A data security breach could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions. Our ability to maintain customer loyalty depends on superior customer service and our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences. Failure to adapt to dynamic customer expectations and technological advancements could adversely affect our competitiveness. The health of the economy and changes in consumer spending patterns could negatively impact our financial performance. Our business is also subject to various litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that may disrupt operations and incur substantial costs. The foregoing risks highlight the multifaceted challenges we face in maintaining operational continuity and adapting to external pressures, which are essential for our organizational resilience.

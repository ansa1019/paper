The company has identified risks and uncertainties that may impair its business and financial statements, including general economic conditions, geopolitical events, and public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The global operations expose the company to risks associated with public health crises, including the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on operations, commercial organizations, supply chains, and distribution systems. The company deployed its capabilities, expertise, and scale to address critical health needs related to COVID-19, including developing diagnostic tests and providing support for vaccine and therapy development. The duration and extent of future demand for COVID-19 related products remain uncertain and depend on multiple factors, including the persistence of the virus in endemic form. The company’s business is sensitive to economic conditions, and slower economic growth, inflation, and changes in government policies can adversely affect demand for products and services, increase order cancellations, and disrupt supply chains. The company faces intense competition and must retain longstanding relationships with major customers while continuously developing new products and services to maintain its competitive advantage. The ability to compete effectively can be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements, including the demand for environmentally-friendly products and services. The company’s growth depends on timely development and commercialization of new products and services based on technological innovation, and failure to innovate may lead to obsolescence. The company has implemented significant restructuring activities to adjust its cost structure, which could diminish resources and competitiveness. The company’s geographic and industry diversity helps limit the impact of any single industry or economy on its consolidated operating results. The company is making significant investments to address rapid technological changes and to globalize its manufacturing and customer-facing resources, particularly in high-growth markets. The company’s success depends on its ability to expand in high-growth geographies, consummate acquisitions, develop innovative products, and improve operational efficiency. The company monitors key competitors and customers to gauge performance and outlook, and its individual businesses must adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. The company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect its business and financial statements. The company has established policies to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these policies will prevent violations. The company’s financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of supplies and labor, and sustained interruptions in supply can result in production delays and inefficiencies. The company’s ability to manage its cash flow and liquidity is critical for funding operations, acquisitions, and investments, and it continues to generate substantial cash from operations to meet its cash requirements. The company’s defined benefit pension plans and healthcare costs are subject to market risks that could adversely affect financial statements. The company is also exposed to various legal and regulatory proceedings that can impact its business and financial statements. The anticipated separation of the environmental & applied solutions segment into a publicly traded company may not achieve the intended benefits and could distract management from operating the business.

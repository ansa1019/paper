There are risks and uncertainties that can affect our business, including the integration of new business and strategic alliances, which may allow for future growth but present significant challenges and uncertainties. Achieving anticipated benefits may be subject to whether unique corporate cultures work collaboratively and efficiently, and unforeseen expenses or delays could disrupt our current plans and operations. The operating environment for the food retailing industry is characterized by fragmentation and intense competition, where customer behavior has shifted rapidly, requiring us to adapt to changing preferences to maintain our competitive advantage. We must anticipate and meet evolving customer needs and implement technology and processes to fulfill orders conveniently and cost-effectively. Our ecosystem monetizes traffic and data insights to create revenue streams, and we are evolving from a traditional food retailer into a more diverse business that expects to deliver consistent net earnings growth. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance customer connection and loyalty, which are critical for sustainable growth. We are committed to investing in our associates and enhancing their experience, which we believe is essential for achieving long-term sustainable growth. Our operations are increasingly dependent on complex information technology systems, and difficulties in maintaining or operating these systems could result in significant losses. Cybersecurity threats pose risks to our operations, and we must continuously invest in our information technology systems to mitigate these risks. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has heightened the possibility of cyberattacks that could affect our operations. We are also subject to various laws and regulations that create challenges and may increase compliance costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Weather conditions and natural disasters have the potential to disrupt our operations, and the effects of climate change may impact our ability to procure goods at optimal costs. Supply chain disruptions could negatively affect our business, and we must effectively manage these risks to maintain operational continuity. Our liquidity and capital resources are managed to ensure we can respond effectively to changes in economic and market conditions, and we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. We believe our current levels of cash and access to capital markets provide us with operational flexibility to confront challenges. The proposed merger with Albertsons is expected to accelerate our strategic initiatives and enhance our ability to navigate the evolving market landscape. Our ability to manage risks and uncertainties, adapt to changing conditions, and maintain operational effectiveness is crucial for our organizational resilience and long-term success.

In addition to the other information set forth in this annual report, we are particularly vulnerable to macroeconomic and market risks, as the transportation industry is highly cyclical and susceptible to trends in economic activity. Our primary business is to transport goods, so our business levels are directly tied to the purchase and production of goods and the rate of growth of global trade. Recent macroeconomic, geopolitical, and public health developments have led certain manufacturers and retailers to invest in producing and housing goods closer to supply chains and consumers. We expect these trends to continue, which may affect our operational flexibility and ability to adapt to changing conditions. Political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has heightened many other risks disclosed in this annual report. Disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattacks, could limit our access to key resources and impact our ability to maintain our strong reputation and the value of the FedEx brand. Our ability to attract and retain customers, operate efficiently, and compete effectively depends on the sophistication, security, and reliability of our technology network. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly unpredictable, and we may experience increased risk of adverse effects on our operations if a significant portion of our workforce is negatively impacted. We have incurred increased operating expenses related to personal protective equipment and safety measures, which may be higher than similar expenses incurred by companies in other industries. Our business operations may be disrupted by remote work arrangements, including due to cyber risks or other disruptions to our technology infrastructure. We are making significant investments and decisions in connection with our long-term business strategy, including initiatives to improve productivity and lower costs through advanced technology and optimization of operations. Our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics is critical to our future financial results. We are also subject to various loss contingencies and legal proceedings that could impact our financial condition. The regulatory environment is evolving, and unfavorable changes could harm our business. We are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding data protection, which may impose significant compliance burdens and costs. Our operations are capital intensive, characterized by significant investments in technology and infrastructure, and we must make commitments to purchase or modify aircraft years before they are needed. Our ability to manage and optimize our capital allocation is essential in a challenging macroeconomic environment. We face intense competition, and our ability to maintain or grow our market share may be impeded by competitors offering better service levels or lower prices. We must also navigate the complexities of labor market challenges, including the availability of qualified personnel and the impact of potential labor organization efforts. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our operational capabilities and resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

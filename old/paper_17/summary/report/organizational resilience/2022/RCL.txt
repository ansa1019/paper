The risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results, affecting our operations. Adverse economic conditions could reduce demand for cruises and passenger spending, impacting our operating results and financial condition. Our business is exposed to many different economies, and challenging conditions in any of the markets could negatively impact our performance. The occurrence of terrorist attacks, war, and other similar events could have a material adverse impact on our business, leading to disruptions and increased operating costs. Disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have caused significant disruptions, creating new risks and exacerbating existing ones, including a drop in demand for cruises and travel restrictions. Our industry may be subject to enhanced health and safety requirements in response to such outbreaks, which may be costly and take time to implement. Significant weather, climate events, and natural disasters could adversely impact our operations, resulting in travel restrictions and guest cancellations. Increased frequency and severity of these events could disrupt our operations further. Our sustainability activities could result in reputational risks and increased costs, as stakeholders place importance on corporate ESG practices. We rely on shipyards and suppliers for the construction and maintenance of our ships, exposing us to risks that could adversely impact our business. Disruptions in our supply chain could limit the availability of critical products and increase costs. We also rely on travel advisors to generate bookings, and disruptions in the travel advisor community could adversely impact our financial condition. Our attempts to expand into new markets may not be successful, increasing the complexity of our operations and straining our resources. We are subject to various international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions and fines, impacting our reputation and financial condition. Our ability to maintain our credit facilities may be affected by changes in our ownership base, which could lead to adverse impacts on our liquidity and operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity, prompting us to take actions to maintain adequate liquidity, including reductions in capital expenditures and operating expenses. We have significant contractual obligations, and our ability to meet these obligations is dependent on our future operating and financial performance. Our reliance on technology and systems requires significant investment, and failure to keep pace with developments could impair our competitive position. Cybersecurity attacks pose risks to our operations and data integrity, and any breach could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. We are exposed to various risks associated with the collection and handling of sensitive information, and compliance with applicable laws may incur substantial costs. The inherent uncertainties in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements could lead to challenges in meeting our obligations.

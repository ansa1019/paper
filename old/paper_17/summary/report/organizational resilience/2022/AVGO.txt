Our business, operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted normal business activity and impacted our supply chain. The pandemic has resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays, which could recur in the event of future disruptions. We depend on our contract manufacturers to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, and any substantial disruption in these services could materially harm our business and customer relationships. Our ability to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our facilities is critical to meet anticipated customer demand, and failure to do so may adversely affect our relationships with customers and our financial condition. We operate in a highly cyclical semiconductor industry characterized by rapid technological change and fluctuations in product supply and demand, which could lead to diminished demand for end-user products and high inventory levels. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, particularly in engineering and technical roles, as competition for these employees is significant. We have made substantial investments in research and development, and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business. Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to various factors, including the timing of new product launches and changes in end-user demand. The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses, which could adversely affect our market acceptance and reputation. We are also subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may incur significant expenses and could restrict our operations. Our business is affected by global political and economic conditions, including trade tensions and geopolitical turmoil, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We may pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, and dispositions, which could involve risks and uncertainties, including unexpected delays and disruption of our business. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for operational flexibility and the ability to adapt to unexpected situations. Our strategic initiatives focus on maintaining our competitive advantage through innovation and effective resource allocation, which are essential for organizational resilience. We recognize that our organizational capabilities, including our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity, are vital for sustaining performance under pressure and achieving long-term success.

Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We face risks related to our ability to compete effectively, fluctuations in our financial results, and unfavorable media coverage. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our advertising business and created challenges in maintaining user engagement. Our ability to retain existing users or add new users is critical to our success, as is maintaining levels of user engagement with our products. The loss of marketers or reduced spending by them could seriously harm our business. We have experienced fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in various markets, particularly due to external pressures such as geopolitical conditions and regulatory changes. The war in Ukraine has restricted access to our services in Russia, contributing to declines in user engagement. We are also subject to government restrictions that could impair our ability to sell advertising and may require us to change our business practices. 

We are investing in our technical infrastructure to build, maintain, and scale our operations, which is essential for our organizational resilience. Our restructuring efforts, including layoffs and facilities consolidation, aim to pursue greater efficiency and realign our strategic priorities. We are making significant investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve our advertising tools and enhance user engagement. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and innovate our product offerings is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. 

Our advertising revenue has been adversely affected by reduced marketer spending and limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools due to regulatory changes and evolving privacy laws. We are developing privacy-enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads while reducing the amount of personal information processed. The complexity of our operations and the need to manage multiple relationships with users, marketers, and developers create significant challenges for our management. 

We recognize that our business is subject to various risks, including cybersecurity threats, which could harm our reputation and diminish user trust. Our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review are designed to combat misuse of our services and user data. We anticipate that these efforts will require significant resources and may impact our ability to launch new features and products in a timely manner. 

The effectiveness of our strategic initiatives and our ability to respond to unexpected situations will determine our organizational resilience. We are continuously evaluating our operational processes and systems to ensure we can effectively manage the scale and complexity of our business. Our financial results are influenced by numerous factors, including our ability to maintain and grow our user base, attract and retain marketers, and comply with evolving regulatory requirements. The ultimate outcome of these matters could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.

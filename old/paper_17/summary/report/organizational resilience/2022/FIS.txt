We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including security breaches, privacy breaches, and cyber attacks, which could harm our business by disrupting delivery of services and damaging our reputation. Cybersecurity is fundamental to our global, complex business, as we electronically receive, process, store, and transmit sensitive business information of our clients. The uninterrupted operation of information systems and the confidentiality of customer information are critical to our successful operation. If we fail to maintain an adequate security infrastructure or adapt to emerging security threats, it could compromise the confidentiality of the information we secure. Unauthorized access to our systems could result in significant operational disruptions and damage to our reputation. The markets for our solutions are characterized by constant technological changes and evolving industry standards, and our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current solutions and develop new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients. We operate in a competitive business environment, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The market for our solutions is intensely competitive, with competitors varying in size and scope. We face direct competition from third parties and potential clients that have historically developed their key applications in-house. Emerging technologies and increased competition may also unbundle bank solutions, resulting in the displacement of our legacy systems. Global economic, political, and other conditions, including business cycles and consumer confidence, may adversely affect our clients or trends in consumer spending, impacting the demand for our services and our revenue. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees, which depend heavily on consumer, business, and government spending levels. Any change in economic factors, including inflation and interest rates, may adversely affect consumer spending and, consequently, our financial performance. We may experience lengthening sales cycles due to economic uncertainty, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Consolidation activity in the banking and financial services industry could also adversely affect our business by eliminating some of our existing clients and making us more dependent on a limited number of clients. We may face pricing pressure in obtaining and retaining clients, and larger clients may seek price reductions during contract renewals. Our business and operating results could be adversely affected by interruptions, errors, or failures in our information technology systems. We may encounter delays in developing new technology solutions, and our systems could be exposed to damage or interruption from various hazards. We are subject to regulation by numerous governmental and regulatory bodies, and failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant penalties. The evolving regulatory landscape requires us to adopt new business practices, impacting our operational flexibility and requiring additional capital investments. We continue to invest in modernization, innovation, and integrated solutions to meet market demands and compete effectively. Our future growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain talent, particularly in technology and management roles, as competition for skilled personnel is intense. The planned spin-off of our merchant business may not achieve anticipated benefits and could disrupt our operations, impacting our ability to adapt to market changes and client needs. We are committed to enhancing our operational resilience through strategic initiatives and continuous improvement in our service offerings.

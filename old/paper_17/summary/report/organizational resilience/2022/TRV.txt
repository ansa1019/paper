The company believes that changing climate conditions have likely added to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. Severe weather events over the last two decades underscore the unpredictability of climate trends, with the frequency and/or severity of hurricane, tornado, hail, and wildfire events in the United States being more volatile during this time period. The insurance industry has experienced increased catastrophe losses due to factors including aging infrastructure, population growth in high-risk areas, and higher inflation. The company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and calibrates catastrophe risk model estimates to manage exposure to catastrophic events. The estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other catastrophic events can be affected by the inability to access impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, and legal and regulatory uncertainties. The company has established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril to develop industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise, which is incorporated into product development, risk selection, pricing, capital allocation, and claim response. The company discusses how changing climate conditions may present issues for its business, including increased frequency and severity of claims, the impact of climate change regulation on customers, and the emergence of liability exposures related to climate conditions. The company’s ability to respond to changes over time through adjustments to its underwriting strategy, product pricing, and related policy terms and conditions is emphasized. The company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur. The ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may result in recognizing higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development. The company’s liquidity requirements can be impacted by the timing and amount of catastrophe claims, which are inherently unpredictable, as well as the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries. The company has experienced a higher level of bodily injury severity than anticipated, which has implications for its operational management and strategic response to emerging risks. The company’s investment strategy focuses on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio to support its insurance operations and ensure adequate liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. The company’s management believes that the combination of operating company liquidity, holding company liquidity, its investment portfolio, and its capital resources are sufficient to meet its contractual obligations. The company’s approach to risk management includes evaluating and monitoring the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. The company’s overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment is unchanged, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding future exposure to asbestos claims. The company’s change in reserve estimates for various product lines reflects better than expected loss experience and highlights the importance of adaptability in its operational practices. The company’s ability to maintain its financial strength ratings and effectively manage its exposure to losses is critical to its organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and environmental perturbations.

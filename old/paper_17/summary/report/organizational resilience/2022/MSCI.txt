Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including operational risks related to our dependence on third parties to supply data, applications, and services for our products and services. Any failure by key vendors to distribute our products or provide necessary data could impair our ability to deliver services to clients, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continually assess its potential effects on our business, taking appropriate actions in accordance with relevant authorities. The pandemic has created significant uncertainties that could negatively impact our operational and financial performance. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is crucial. We recognize that our clients may become more self-sufficient, which could reduce demand for our products or services and materially affect our business. Additionally, we face pressures from competition and financial constraints affecting our clients, which may lead to price reductions or loss of market share. Our growth strategy includes extending leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes, leading the enablement of ESG and climate investment integration, and enhancing distribution and content-enabling technology. We must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services to remain competitive, which requires effective collaboration across various functions and product lines. Our global operations and future expansions may place significant demands on our management and resources, exposing us to additional risks and costs. We are also subject to extensive laws, rules, and regulations that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our ability to maintain compliance with these regulations is critical to our operational resilience. The realization of any risks, including reputational damage or failure to comply with laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have implemented safeguards and policies to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access to confidential information, and we continually assess our operational continuity plans. Our financial flexibility may be impacted by changes in economic conditions, and we must manage our resources effectively to navigate these challenges. Our organizational capabilities, including our ability to attract and retain talent, are essential to our success. The competitive landscape is evolving, and we must adapt to changing market conditions and client needs to sustain our performance. Our operational management strategies are designed to enhance our resilience and ensure that we can respond effectively to unexpected situations, thereby maintaining our organizational health and effectiveness.

Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those related to supply chain management, which places significant pressure on operational flexibility and business continuity. We have been and could continue to be subject to manufacturing disruptions and supply chain delays, which could hinder our ability to forecast component supply, manufacturing capacity, and timing of inventory receipts. A significant interruption in these critical functions has resulted in delayed order fulfillment or cancellation of orders, negatively impacting our relationships with customers and reducing future sales. The reliance on third-party manufacturers to build our products exposes us to operational risks, including their ability to obtain components in a timely manner and to ramp manufacturing sufficiently to meet customer demand. We face intense competition and industry consolidation, which could harm our business and financial condition. Our revenue growth may decline if we are unable to attract new large customers or sell additional products and services to existing customers, particularly in a rapidly evolving networking market. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from large end customers, which has been linked to changes in demand patterns and the complexity of large orders. Our ability to maintain our competitive position relies on our capacity to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, including the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. The ongoing global economic uncertainties, including inflation and geopolitical tensions, may negatively impact our ability to fulfill customer demand and could lead to increased costs and reduced gross margins. We continue to monitor the impact of these macroeconomic factors on our operations and financial condition. Our research and development efforts are focused on new product development and maintaining additional functionality for our existing products, which is critical for sustaining our competitive advantage. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time due to various factors, including pricing pressure from competition and the mix of sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing. The complexity of managing our supply chain and inventory is compounded by external pressures such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which have resulted in prolonged manufacturing and supply chain disruptions. Our operational management strategies must address these challenges to ensure resilience and adaptability in our business model. We have made substantial investments to develop new products and services, and our success in these new markets depends on our ability to attract a customer base and compete effectively. The variability in our customer concentration and the unpredictability of our revenue recognition necessitate a robust demand planning strategy to mitigate risks associated with order cancellations and delays. We are committed to enhancing our organizational capabilities and maintaining operational continuity in the face of adversity, ensuring that we can respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure.

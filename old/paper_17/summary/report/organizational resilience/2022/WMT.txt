The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping, which may affect our market position and financial performance. Our strategy, which includes investments in ecommerce, technology, talent, and supply chain automation, may not adequately allow us to grow our ecommerce business or offset the impact of a moderated pace of new store openings. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience that deepens our relationships with customers. Furthermore, failure to respond effectively to consumer trends could negatively affect our relationship with customers, demand for our products, and our market share. The emergence of global health pandemics, such as COVID-19, could disrupt our operations, impacting demand, supply chain operations, and our ability to predict future performance. The occurrence of natural disasters, climate change, and geopolitical events could materially affect our financial performance, resulting in physical damage to properties, disruption of supply chains, and changes in consumer purchasing patterns. Our operations are also subject to risks associated with suppliers, including political and economic instability that could disrupt the supply of goods. We face strong competition from various retailers, and failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures could adversely affect our financial performance. Our ability to attract and retain qualified associates is critical to our business success, and we compete for talent with other businesses, which could increase our labor costs. The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships could materially affect our financial performance, as these arrangements may not generate the anticipated level of sales. We are also exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats, which could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our reputation and financial performance. Our compliance programs and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk, and disruptions caused by security incidents could materially affect our operations. Changes in laws and regulations could require us to modify our operations, increasing our operating costs and potentially impacting our financial performance. The ongoing uncertainty in the global economy, including inflation and supply chain pressures, may impact our results. We are committed to helping customers save money and live better, but we have seen supply chain disruptions contributing to higher than normal inventory levels. Our strategies include adjusting pricing and merchandising to respond to cost increases and working with suppliers to manage costs. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations and support long-term growth. The risks we face are multifaceted and include operational, financial, legal, and reputational factors that could adversely affect our business performance and resilience in a rapidly changing environment.

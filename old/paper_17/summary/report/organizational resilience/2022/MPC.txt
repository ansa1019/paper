Our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses, which adversely affect our operations and may result in significant damage to property and equipment, impaired ability to manufacture our products, and substantial losses. We have experienced certain of these incidents in the past, and the occurrence of these events can lead to operational disruptions. We are increasingly dependent on the performance of our information technology systems and those of our third-party business partners and service providers for the safe and effective operation of our business. Cybersecurity threats may compromise our ability to operate and the integrity of data in our systems. We have developed disaster recovery plans and systems, but these may not be sufficient to defend against all unauthorized attempts to access our information or impact our systems. Our operations are also subject to risks arising from our operations outside the United States, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on our business and on general economic, financial, and business conditions. We continue to focus on strengthening our competitive position by evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio, ensuring that each asset generates free cash flow back to the business.

The risks associated with societal and political pressures regarding carbon-based fuels could adversely impact our business and ability to realize certain growth strategies. We are subject to increasing environmental and climate-related litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in tax laws, regulatory actions, and compliance costs related to evolving environmental regulations. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, which is essential for our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives. Our liquidity position is supported by cash flows from operations and access to capital markets, enabling us to manage resource allocation effectively in response to market conditions.

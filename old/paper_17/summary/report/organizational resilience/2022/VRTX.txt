Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. We invest significant resources in the research, development, manufacturing, and supply of therapies for serious diseases, and if we are unable to successfully commercialize these therapies, our business could be materially harmed. Our future success is largely dependent upon our ability to increase revenues from sales of our medicines, which requires us to gain approval and reimbursement for our products. We have limited experience developing and commercializing cell and genetic therapies, which could result in challenges that delay or prevent their development and commercialization. The commercial success of our therapies will depend on acceptance by the medical community, patients, and third-party payors, and we may face difficulties in recruiting patients for clinical trials, which could delay regulatory approval. We are also subject to various and evolving laws and regulations that govern the privacy and security of personal data, and failure to comply could adversely affect our business. Our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to engage in transactions and collaborations that add to our pipeline or provide new commercial opportunities. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or collaborations, and the integration following any such acquisition may disrupt our business. We depend on third-party manufacturers and our internal capabilities to manufacture our products, and any disruptions in these relationships could significantly affect our operations. Our reliance on third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities, and we remain responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks, including the potential for adverse results in clinical trials. We have adopted a business continuity plan to address crises, but if we are unable to implement these plans fully, we may experience significant disruptions in our operations. Our revenues are subject to fluctuations due to various factors, including the timing of orders from significant customers and changes in reimbursement rates from third-party payors. We expect to continue to invest in our research programs and expand our capabilities in cell and genetic therapies, which may require substantial resources. Our strategic initiatives involve balancing risks inherent in product development while pursuing innovative medicines. The successful commercialization of our products and achievement of our research and development objectives depend on our ability to respond effectively to external pressures and maintain operational flexibility. We face intense competition for skilled personnel, and failure to attract and retain qualified employees could materially harm our business. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have added complexity to our operations, including potential delays in clinical trials and disruptions in our supply chain. We monitor local COVID-19 trends and government guidance to assess employee access to our sites, but any site closures or delays could adversely affect our operations and the development of our product candidates.

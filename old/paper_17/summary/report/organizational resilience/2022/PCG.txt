The utility's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the costs and effectiveness of the utility's wildfire mitigation initiatives, which include vegetation management, asset inspections, and system hardening. The success of these initiatives depends on various factors, including the utility's ability to retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation actions. The utility has taken aggressive steps to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires, and its wildfire mitigation initiatives are designed to reduce the potential for catastrophic wildfires related to electrical equipment, reduce the potential for fires to spread, and reduce the impact of public safety power shutoff events. The utility's ability to adapt to potential business and regulatory changes is critical, as failure to meet customer demand for new business interconnections in a timely manner could materially impact its business model and strategy execution. The utility's operational networks and information technology systems could be impacted by a cyber incident, severe natural event, or physical attack, which may disrupt operations and negatively affect the utility's ability to safely generate, transport, deliver, and store energy. The utility's infrastructure is aging, posing risks to safety and system reliability, and the utility may not be successful in mitigating the risk of future wildfires despite significant investments in mitigation measures. The utility's ability to recover costs associated with wildfire-related claims and legal fees through rates is contingent upon the California Public Utilities Commission's determination that the utility has met the prudency standard. The utility's wildfire-related liabilities depend on various factors, including negotiations and settlements, the cause of each fire, and the extent of damages incurred. The utility's financial performance is also influenced by external pressures such as severe weather conditions, extended drought, and climate change, which have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management. The utility has developed adaptation plans to address the potential effects of climate change on its assets, operations, and services, recognizing that the consequences of climate-driven events could include increased stress on the energy supply network, reduced hydroelectric output, and higher operational costs. The utility's organizational culture and governance are under scrutiny as part of an ongoing investigation into whether they prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to achieve safety goals. The utility's compliance with regulatory requirements and its ability to manage costs effectively are critical to maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of regulatory and environmental challenges. The utility has established a robust compliance program and is focused on delivering excellent customer experiences to limit the impact of enforcement and litigation matters. The utility's strategic initiatives, including its wildfire mitigation efforts, are essential for ensuring organizational resilience and adapting to the evolving regulatory landscape while addressing the demands of a changing business environment.

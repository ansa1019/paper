Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including market fluctuations and economic, political, and other factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These factors may impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives and maintain operational flexibility. The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and other global health emergencies have highlighted the need for effective crisis management and adaptability in response to unexpected situations. Market downturns and volatility may cause individual investors to limit their participation in global markets, negatively impacting our retail business and product sales. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent, which is critical for maintaining our organizational capabilities and ensuring effective service delivery. Our continued success depends on our ability to attract, motivate, engage, and retain qualified individuals in a competitive market. The financial services industry is experiencing increased labor market activity, which has resulted in labor shortages and increased costs of labor. We recognize that increased turnover may impact our ability to support and retain clients. Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments, which could lead to investment losses or ineffective hedging strategies. The interconnectedness of financial institutions means that the decline in the financial condition of one or more institutions may expose us to credit losses or defaults. We have exposure to various industries and counterparties, and our operations depend on the performance and financial strength of these institutions. The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters and catastrophes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Such events may disrupt our ordinary business operations and impact our ability to process transactions or provide products and services to our clients. We have established policies and implemented technical and operational measures designed to protect sensitive information and respond to cybersecurity incidents. However, the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats requires ongoing monitoring and continual improvement of our security capabilities. We believe that our ability to maintain adequate capital for regulatory or other purposes is essential for organizational resilience. Our financial strength ratings are critical to maintaining public confidence in our products and competitive position. Any downgrade in our ratings could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We continuously assess our exposure to different industries and counterparties, and we regularly review our reserve levels to ensure they are adequate to cover future obligations. The ability to effectively manage operational, legal, and regulatory risks is crucial for maintaining organizational health and achieving our major objectives. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our operational resilience and adaptability in the face of external pressures and market volatility. We recognize the importance of collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration in fostering resilience and ensuring effective responses to disruptive events. The management of operational resources and the implementation of change management processes are vital for maintaining organizational effectiveness and performance under pressure. We are committed to developing innovative products and services that meet evolving client demands while navigating the complexities of regulatory requirements and market conditions.

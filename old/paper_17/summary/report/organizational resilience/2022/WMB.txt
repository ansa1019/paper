Our ongoing major expansion projects include the deepwater shenandoah project, which expands our existing gulf of mexico offshore infrastructure, and the regional energy access project, which aims to increase capacity in the northeastern United States. We have adopted certain practices highlighted in our sustainability report, including with respect to air emissions, biodiversity, and climate change. We face pressures from stockholders to prioritize sustainable energy practices and reduce our carbon footprint. The occurrence of risks such as opposition to infrastructure projects, unexpected increases in capital expenditures, and physical damages to facilities could impact our ability to execute our plans. 

We continuously monitor regulatory changes and how they may impact our operations. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. We are also subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions that could impair our operations and impact our ability to deliver services. Our reliance on third-party pipelines and other facilities for delivery options could adversely affect our revenues if these facilities become unavailable. We face risks related to climate change, including physical and financial risks associated with extreme weather events, which could increase our costs and impact our operational capabilities. 

Our ability to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce is critical to our operational effectiveness. We recognize the importance of maintaining organizational resilience through effective risk management, strategic initiatives, and operational flexibility. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by various factors, including changes in market conditions, competition, and regulatory environments. We are committed to adapting our strategies to ensure continued performance under pressure and to maintain our organizational health in the face of external pressures and challenges.

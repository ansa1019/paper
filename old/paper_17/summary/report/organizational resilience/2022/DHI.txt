The homebuilding, lot development, and rental housing industries are cyclical and affected by changes in economic, real estate, or other conditions that could adversely affect business or financial results. Adverse changes in these general and local economic conditions or deterioration in the broader economy may negatively impact business and financial results and increase the risk for asset impairments and write-offs. The company has experienced multiple disruptions in its supply chain, which have resulted in shortages of certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, causing construction cycles to lengthen and impacting profit margins. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the global economy, contributing to disruptions in the supply chain. The effects of the pandemic on operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including its impact on customers, trade partners, and employees. The company believes it is well-positioned to meet changing market conditions with its affordable product offerings and lot supply, managing home pricing, sales incentives, and inventory levels based on homebuyer demand. The company’s strategy focuses on enhancing long-term value to shareholders by maximizing returns on inventory investments and generating strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk and maintaining financial flexibility to navigate changing economic conditions. The company maintains significant cash balances and a strong liquidity position while controlling debt levels, which provides operational flexibility to adjust to changes in economic and market conditions. The company regularly assesses projected capital requirements to fund growth, repay debt obligations, and maintain sufficient cash and liquidity levels to support operational needs. The company’s financial services operations are subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which could adversely affect business or financial results. The company’s ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to operational success, and it seeks to retain key personnel and have succession plans in place to address potential losses. The company’s operations are also affected by competitive conditions within the industries in which it operates, which could negatively impact sales volumes, selling prices, and profit margins. The company’s homebuilding operations utilize a senior unsecured revolving credit facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit, and it regularly evaluates opportunities to raise additional capital. The company believes that its existing cash resources, revolving credit facilities, and ability to access capital markets will provide sufficient liquidity to fund near-term working capital needs and debt obligations. The company’s business and financial results could be adversely affected by significant inflation, higher interest rates, or deflation, which could lead to a decrease in overall spending and borrowing levels. The company is subject to various risks, including supply shortages, adverse weather conditions, and natural disasters, which could harm business operations and financial results. The company’s ability to manage and service debt and comply with related covenants could also adversely affect financial condition or operating flexibility. The company’s strategic initiatives include investing in lots, land, and land development in desirable markets while controlling the level of land and lots owned in each market relative to local new home demand.

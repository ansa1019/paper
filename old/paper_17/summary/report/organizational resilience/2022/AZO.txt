Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and stock price. We face strategic and operational risks, including demand fluctuations for our products, which may be influenced by factors beyond our control such as economic conditions, technological advances, and the prevalence of electric vehicles. Our ability to compete effectively against other businesses selling similar products is critical, as competitors may possess greater financial and marketing resources. We rely on our workforce, which represents our largest operating expense, and we face challenges in hiring, training, and retaining qualified employees due to market pressures and regulatory changes. Our business is also impacted by external pressures, including employment laws and potential unionization efforts, which could affect our operational flexibility and culture. We depend on our domestic and international vendors to supply quality merchandise at competitive prices, and disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our ability to distribute inventory timely, resulting in lost sales and customer loyalty. Events such as natural disasters and public health crises can negatively impact our operations and supply chain, highlighting the need for effective crisis management and preparedness strategies. Our reputation is vital for maintaining customer trust and loyalty, and any negative publicity could adversely affect our brand and financial performance. We utilize information technology systems extensively, and any failure or interruption in these systems could disrupt our operations and key business processes. The evolving regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity presents additional challenges that could impact our operational resilience. Our ability to manage risks associated with global supply chains, including geopolitical and economic factors, is essential for sustaining our competitive advantage.

The risk and return committee oversees the effectiveness of the program, governance structure, and risk-related decision-making, while focusing on the company's overall risk profile. The transformative growth strategy aims to accelerate growth by improving customer value, expanding customer access, increasing customer acquisition sophistication, and modernizing the technology ecosystem. If the strategy is not implemented effectively, customer retention and policy growth objectives could be adversely impacted. The company actively manages its capital and liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic, and business conditions, ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet obligations. The management of market risk is integral to the results of operations, and the company employs various strategies to manage risks associated with interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. The enterprise risk appetite is cascaded into individual risk limits, which set boundaries on the amount of risk the company is willing to accept from specific risk categories. The company regularly identifies, measures, manages, monitors, and reports all significant risks, including strategic, insurance, investment, financial, operational, and culture risks. The operational risk and return management framework is anchored to the enterprise risk and return management learning loop, which includes risk identification, measurement, management, monitoring, and reporting. The company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in its comprehensive approach to risk management, which includes scenario analysis and stochastic modeling to assess potential losses. The company’s claims organization executes a plan to manage the impacts of a higher loss cost environment and continuously refines its best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. The company also focuses on maintaining operational continuity and flexibility in response to environmental perturbations and unexpected situations. The integration of risk management into strategic initiatives ensures that the company can adapt to changes in the competitive landscape and external pressures while maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. The company’s resilience strategies include proactive measures to mitigate risks associated with disruptive events and the development of capabilities to respond effectively to crises. The emphasis on learning organization principles supports the company’s ability to reconfigure and adapt its operations in response to evolving customer needs and market conditions. The company recognizes the importance of emotional resources and social capital in fostering a resilient organizational culture that can withstand pressures and uncertainties. The management of claims and claims expense reserves is a critical component of the company’s risk management strategy, ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to meet future obligations while navigating the complexities of the insurance landscape.

Our ability to manage risk or influence outcomes in joint ventures may be constrained, as we conduct many operations through joint ventures where another partner is the operator, which may not align with our interests. The scope and nature of our operations present significant hazards and risks, including operational hazards such as explosions, fires, and severe weather, which require continuous oversight. Our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond appropriately to these hazards or major crises, or if we fail to efficiently restore affected operational components. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy and disrupted supply chains, creating significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets, which could materially increase costs and negatively impact revenues. Our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that continue to increase in complexity, affecting our ability to operate and requiring substantial capital expenditures. The evolving political and economic landscape, including potential sanctions and restrictions, could damage our operations and reduce profitability. We have adopted operating principles designed to meet or exceed government requirements, and our practices evolve as technology improves and regulations change. Our climate risk strategy is aligned with the aims of the Paris Agreement, focusing on managing climate-related risks and optimizing opportunities. We aim to maintain a resilient asset portfolio and set emissions-reduction targets to address climate-related challenges. Our commitment to responsible and reliable ESG performance is reflected in our climate risk framework and our ambition to achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2050. We continuously assess our operational and financial strategies to ensure resilience in the face of market volatility and external pressures. Our foundational principles include maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, and making disciplined investments, all of which support our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The macro-environment continues to evolve, and we believe our strategic initiatives will allow us to navigate these challenges effectively. We strive to maintain operational flexibility and adaptability in our capital allocation decisions, ensuring that we can respond to unexpected situations and pressures. Our commitment to sustainability and addressing climate-related risks is integral to our long-term strategy, as we recognize the importance of reducing greenhouse gas intensity in our operations. The energy transition will likely be complex and evolve over multiple decades, requiring us to continuously adapt our strategies and operations. Our ability to foresee and confront challenges, including regulatory changes and market dynamics, is critical to our organizational resilience and long-term success.

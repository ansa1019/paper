We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events, and outcomes, as well as our business outlook and objectives, which are subject to numerous risks that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position, or future financial performance. Our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain is critical, as our business results depend on maintaining key manufacturing and supply arrangements. Disruptions due to natural disasters, acts of war, or disease outbreaks could interrupt product supply and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We face significant operational challenges, including the need to manage cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. Our competitive landscape requires us to respond effectively to local, regional, or global economic volatility, including reduced market growth rates and the ability to generate sufficient income and cash flow to achieve our expected share repurchases and dividend payments. Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to significant local, regional, or global economic or social disruptions. We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture, and divestiture activities, as these could adversely impact our financial results. Our organizational structure is designed to support our strategic initiatives and resilience strategies, enabling us to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences. We rely on third-party relationships, which create additional risk, and we must effectively manage these relationships to avoid disruptions in our operations and financial results. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations and may continue to do so, leading to potential impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets. Our ability to manage and mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, political volatility, and labor market disruptions is essential for maintaining operational continuity and organizational health. We must also address the evolving regulatory landscape, which could increase compliance costs and impact our business operations. Our strategic focus includes leveraging environmental sustainability as a driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility and resilience, and delivering on our employee value equation to attract and retain top talent. We are committed to enhancing our organizational capabilities and ensuring we can confront and adapt to unexpected situations effectively. The ability to foresee and respond to disruptions is crucial for our organizational success, as is maintaining operational flexibility to navigate complex situations and external pressures. Our approach to crisis management and preparedness is integral to sustaining our performance under pressure and achieving our major objectives in a turbulent business environment.

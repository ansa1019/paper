The successful operation of new facilities or transmission or distribution projects is subject to risks relating to supply interruptions; labor availability, work stoppages and labor disputes; weather interferences; unforeseen engineering and environmental problems, including those related to climate change; opposition from local communities, and other risks described herein. Severe weather or acts of nature, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of our facilities, and cause service outages, production delays, and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. The effects of climate change will have increased the physical risks to our facilities and operations resulting from such climate hazards as more severe weather events, such as experienced from superstorm Sandy and tropical storms Isaias and Ida, sea level rise, and extreme heat. Our business is subject to policy, regulatory, technology, and economic uncertainties and contingencies, including regulatory approvals required for various of our clean energy initiatives, many of which are beyond our control and may affect our ability to implement our clean energy strategy and initiatives and achieve our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, or other greenhouse gas emissions reduction or climate-related goals that we may set from time to time, in a cost-effective manner or at all. We have historically benefited from access to mutual aid, a voluntary and reciprocal arrangement with other utilities that provides access to a trained and flexible labor force which has helped to reduce outage restoration times during extreme weather events. However, there is no guarantee that we will have continued access to mutual aid as the utility industry consolidates and the frequency of severe weather events rises. Our ability to generate cash flow is dependent upon, among other things, industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors. The ability to arrange financing and to refinance existing debt and the costs of such financing or refinancing depend on numerous factors including, among other things: general economic and capital market conditions, including but not limited to, prevailing interest rates; the availability of credit from banks and other financial institutions; tax, regulatory, and securities law developments; investor confidence in us and our industry; and our current level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in our debt agreements. We are exposed to the risk of asset and equipment failures, gas explosions, accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of war or terrorism or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations, sabotage, physical attacks, or security breaches, cyberattacks, or other incidents, including pandemics such as the coronavirus pandemic, that impact our ability to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and remain competitive and could result in substantial financial losses. The success of our businesses is dependent on our ability to continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers while minimizing service disruptions. Our business plan focuses on achieving growth by allocating capital primarily toward regulated investments in an effort to continue to improve the sustainability and predictability of our business. We are focused on investing to modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability and resilience, increase energy efficiency, and deliver cleaner energy to meet customer expectations and be well aligned with public policy objectives.

Our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control, which could adversely affect our operations or cash flows. Significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation, or other necessary supplies could adversely affect our financial results. An inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements or avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. Cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, and failures of key information technology systems could disrupt our business operations and cause financial and reputational damage. While we have contingency plans in place to mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations. Our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and political, social, and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. The war in Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in Russia and the surrounding region, leading to increased input costs and supply chain complexities. Our ability to continue operations in Russia may change as we experience reduced consumer demand and restricted access to financial institutions. We face various risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, which may have material adverse effects on our business, including disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in demand for our products and changes in consumer behavior. Disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business. Our ability to manufacture, distribute, and sell products is critical to our operations and is subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, labor strikes, and governmental regulatory requirements. We have a complex network of suppliers, including sole-source suppliers, and disruptions at these suppliers could adversely impact our operations. Our strategy includes operations growth outside the U.S., especially in developing markets, which may be affected by political, economic, and currency volatility. We continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions and enhancing operational efficiencies. Our growth strategy is built on delivering value-added innovations and driving category opportunities, which are enabled by our focus on investing in our commercial capabilities. We are subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our business operations and financial results, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in consumer purchasing patterns. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We are actively monitoring the situation in Russia and the increased risk of cyber-based attacks as a result of the war in Ukraine. Our climate change risk categories include transition risks and physical risks, which could disrupt our operations. We continue to progress toward our sustainability goals, which include reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and responsible sourcing practices. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not act responsibly regarding sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business.

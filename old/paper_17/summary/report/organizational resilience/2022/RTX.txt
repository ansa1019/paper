Our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity can be impacted by changes in global economic conditions, international relations, and geopolitical events, which can create pressures that affect our performance. The current global supply chain and labor market challenges have negatively affected our performance and that of our suppliers and subcontractors, highlighting the need for operational flexibility and resilience strategies to mitigate risks. We face risks relating to our U.S. government contracts, including potential performance delays and cost overruns, which could negatively impact our competitive position and financial condition. The tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our customers' ability to obtain financing, leading to a decrease in orders for our products and services, thus impacting our organizational health. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in economic activity, which could lead to significant disruptions in our operations. We continuously work to mitigate the effects of supply chain issues by seeking alternate supply sources and increasing our inventory of materials, reflecting our commitment to resource management and operational continuity. The COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated our operational landscape, creating uncertainties that could hinder our recovery and adaptation efforts. Our performance is also influenced by the evolving nature of government policies and regulations, which can impact our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We are subject to risks associated with cybersecurity threats, which could disrupt our systems and impact our operational integrity. Our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel is crucial for maintaining our organizational capabilities and resilience in the face of adversity. The complexity of our operations requires us to adapt and reconfigure our strategies to meet customer needs and respond to unexpected situations. We are committed to fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration, which is essential for navigating turbulent markets and ensuring our long-term sustainability. Our strategic initiatives, including digital transformation and restructuring plans, are aimed at enhancing our operational effectiveness and resilience. The integration of advanced technologies into our operations is critical for maintaining a competitive advantage and ensuring we can respond to future challenges. We recognize the importance of stakeholder engagement and inter-organizational collaboration in achieving our major objectives and enhancing our organizational resilience. The dynamic nature of our business environment necessitates a proactive approach to risk management and resource allocation, ensuring we can effectively confront and adapt to complex situations.

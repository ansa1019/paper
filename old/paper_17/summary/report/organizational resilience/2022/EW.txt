Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty, which may adversely affect our organizational resilience. The covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted nearly all aspects of our business and markets, including our workforce and operations, necessitating a proactive approach to maintain access to our technologies while supporting clinician partners and protecting employee well-being. We are actively managing inventory, assessing alternative logistics options, and closely monitoring the supply of components to address potential supply constraints. Our continued growth and success depend on our ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products in a timely manner. Failure to successfully innovate and market products could have a material effect on our prospects, particularly in the face of competitive pressures and changing customer preferences. We face substantial competition and must demonstrate the full value of our differentiated products to healthcare providers and payors to maintain our competitive position. The success of many of our products depends upon key physicians and research institutions, whose knowledge and experience are critical to our innovation and market strategies. Our reliance on third parties for design, manufacture, and sterilization of products introduces risks that could disrupt our operations. We are subject to risks associated with public health crises, including staffing shortages and impacts on clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The operational impacts of the pandemic and other external pressures highlight the importance of organizational flexibility and the ability to adapt to unexpected situations. We have experienced significant setbacks in clinical trials, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals and the market's view of our future prospects. Our manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruptions from various factors, including natural disasters and cyber incidents, which could materially affect our business. We are also exposed to risks associated with international sales and operations, including economic conditions and regulatory changes that could impact our ability to operate effectively in global markets. Our strategic initiatives, including investments in research and development, are essential for maintaining our operational capabilities and responding to market demands. We continuously assess our organizational practices and engage in change management processes to enhance our resilience strategies. The competitive landscape requires us to remain agile and responsive to environmental disturbances, ensuring that we can sustain performance under pressure. Our ability to recruit and retain qualified talent is critical to our organizational health and operational continuity. We are committed to developing innovative technologies and providing patient care while navigating the complexities of the healthcare environment. The interplay of external pressures, competitive dynamics, and our internal capabilities will shape our organizational resilience and ability to thrive in a challenging business environment.

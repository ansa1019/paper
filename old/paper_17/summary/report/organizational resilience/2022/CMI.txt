The ongoing nature of our formal internal review and discussions with regulatory agencies emphasizes our commitment to compliance and the need to adapt our emissions systems to enhance effectiveness, which is essential for maintaining our competitive position. Our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be critical for us to sustain our operational flexibility and competitive advantage in the engine applications and industries we serve. The nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards are unpredictable and subject to change, which could result in a loss of our competitive advantage. Our business operates globally, and changes in international trade laws and regulations could adversely impact demand for our products and our competitive position. We are also vulnerable to fluctuations in raw material, transportation, and labor prices, which could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers. Supply chain disruptions have significantly impacted our results of operations and financial condition, limiting our ability to meet end-user demand. We are diligently working to minimize these supply chain impacts to our business and to our customers. The successful development and introduction of new products to comply with regulatory requirements are subject to risks such as delays in product development and unanticipated technical difficulties. Our geographic diversity and broad product offerings help limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or region. We face significant competition in the regions we serve, and our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, and emissions compliance. The demand for our products is influenced by various factors, including economic conditions and customer preferences, which can fluctuate significantly. Our strategic initiatives involve exploring acquisitions and divestitures to improve revenue growth and operational benefits. The integration of acquired operations, such as Meritor, poses uncertainties that could affect our ability to realize anticipated benefits. We are also subject to risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations, which could limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Our operations are affected by geopolitical risks, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in the suspension of our operations in Russia. The impact of climate change and evolving regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our operations and competitive landscape. Our organizational resilience is tested by the need to adapt to these external pressures and to maintain operational continuity amidst environmental disruptions. We recognize the importance of internal knowledge and capabilities in navigating these challenges, and we are committed to fostering a learning organization that can effectively respond to unexpected situations and crises. Our strategic response mechanisms are designed to enhance our resilience and ensure that we can maintain performance under pressure while adapting to changing market conditions.

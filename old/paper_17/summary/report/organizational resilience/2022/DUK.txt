Duke Energy's future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy, including achieving its carbon emissions reduction goals. The company’s clean energy transition is subject to uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve. The approval of state regulators is necessary for the company to continue to retire existing carbon-emitting assets or invest in new generation capacity. The rapid transition to certain low-carbon resources may challenge the ability to meet customer expectations of reliability in a carbon-constrained environment. Additionally, the company is continuing to seek to renew operating licenses for its nuclear reactors, which are central to achieving its objectives. The regulatory, legislative, and legal risks associated with the utility's operations may limit its ability to recover costs and could negatively impact earnings. The company’s results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic, and other conditions beyond its control, including economic downturns that could impact the financial stability of customers and result in increased bad debt expense. The company is actively working to manage and maintain prices at lower levels despite increased commodity prices and is focused on driving productivity, increasing flexibility, and prioritizing spending based on risk and strategic value. The modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters and storm hardening, helps ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improving reliability and flexibility. The company has demonstrated its ability to effectively handle storm response efforts, applying lessons learned from previous events. Duke Energy's climate strategy is integrated into its business strategy, focusing on investing in carbon-free technology and modernizing infrastructure to deliver sustainable value while maintaining affordability. The company is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and has established interim targets for carbon emissions reduction. The impacts of global climate change and regulatory changes related to greenhouse gas emissions may require additional capital expenditures and increase operating costs. The company recognizes that severe weather events could materially impact future results of operations, and it routinely takes steps to reduce potential impacts on its electric transmission and distribution systems. The steps include modernizing infrastructure and maintaining inventories of fuel to mitigate disruptions. The company’s ability to recover costs associated with compliance with environmental regulations may be affected by changes in regulatory frameworks, which could result in delays or failure to recover such costs. Duke Energy’s operations are subject to extensive federal regulation and a wide variety of laws and governmental policies, including environmental regulations that may change over time. The company’s strategic initiatives include enhancing operational management and resource allocation to address external pressures and ensure organizational resilience in the face of evolving market conditions and regulatory landscapes.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally, impacting our business operations and financial condition. We continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply chain costs. The magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and the resulting decline in global business activity are uncertain. Our customers have experienced disruptions in their operations, resulting in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The ongoing economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. We have taken multiple steps to mitigate the component shortages and deliver products to our customers, including partnering with key suppliers and optimizing our inventory build and customer delivery plans. We recognize the increased risks associated with our increased inventory balances and purchase commitments to secure supply to meet customer demand. The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging, significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. We have experienced fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially due to changes in the global economic environment and the overall movement toward industry consolidation among competitors. Our ability to execute strategic plans and achieve targeted cost reductions is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and organizational health. We are focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing their digital transformations, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings is part of our strategy to adapt to changing customer needs and market conditions. We have initiated a restructuring plan to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. We continue to invest in research and development to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. The success of our new products and services depends on several factors, including timely completion and market acceptance. We face increased competition in various markets, which may lead to more variability in our operating results. Our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at addressing the evolving needs of customers and ensuring operational continuity. The risks associated with supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainties necessitate a proactive approach to risk management and resource allocation. We believe that our strong cash position allows us to use our resources for strategic investments, acquisitions, and customer financing activities, which are critical for sustaining organizational resilience.

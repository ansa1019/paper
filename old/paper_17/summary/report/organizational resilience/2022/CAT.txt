The statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business, which include various external pressures and disruptive events that could materially affect our operations and financial condition. Our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions, which can lead to reduced demand for our products and services during economic downturns. Catastrophic events, including global pandemics such as COVID-19, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The occurrence of major disruptions could adversely affect our employees, our systems, and our ability to produce and distribute our products. Current material and component shortages, logistics constraints, and labor inefficiencies have limited our ability to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We continue to monitor a variety of external factors, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures, and have developed contingency plans to minimize challenges that may impact our ability to meet increasing customer demand. The demand for our products generally depends on customers' ability to pay, which is influenced by their access to funds and overall economic conditions. Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results, and our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks that could disrupt economic activity. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing, and we must develop and sell products that appeal to our customers. Our continued success is dependent on leading-edge innovation and the ability to maintain key dealer relationships. We face risks associated with our past or future acquisitions, including the failure to achieve anticipated revenue or profit forecasts and unforeseen expenses that may arise during integration. Unexpected events, including natural disasters and pandemics, may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations. We are also subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs, and failure to comply could expose us to penalties or civil liability. Our financial position is influenced by our ability to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position, and we track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow, and margins. We utilize a match-funding policy to manage interest rate risk, aligning the interest rate profile of our debt portfolio with that of our finance receivable portfolio. The potential impact of changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions is continuously monitored, and we have implemented various strategies to mitigate associated risks. Our organizational resilience is further supported by our focus on strategic initiatives, including investments in technology and services growth, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to market changes.

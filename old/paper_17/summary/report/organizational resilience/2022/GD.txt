An investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties, including the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability, and quality of commodities and subsystems. The U.S. government provides a significant portion of our revenue, and levels of U.S. defense spending may be impacted by numerous factors, such as the domestic political environment and changes in national and international priorities. Our revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government, and decreases in U.S. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could impact our financial performance. U.S. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and funding is subject to disruption or delay, which can impact our programs and timing of new awards. The annual budget process may be delayed or disrupted, potentially leading to a shutdown or operation under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels. Changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for our programs, and delays or changes in funding can affect the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content. Our business operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to audit by the U.S. government, which can result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed. We face various cybersecurity threats, including unauthorized access to our proprietary information and physical security threats, which challenge our operational continuity and resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to our operations, including temporary closures of facilities and supply chain disruptions, which could materially adversely affect our ability to perform on contracts. We continuously evaluate the evolving landscape of environmental-related legislation and seek opportunities for continuous improvement, although changes in customer demand patterns driven by climate change may adversely affect our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet customer needs. The demand for skilled personnel may exceed supply, leading to higher labor costs. We rely on other companies and government customers to provide materials and components, and any disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our ability to meet commitments. Our operational flexibility is critical in managing risks associated with supplier performance and the complexity of our contracts. We emphasize cash flow generation and cost control, which provides us with the flexibility for prudent capital deployment and preserves a strong balance sheet for future opportunities. Our capital deployment strategy includes investments in products and services to drive long-term growth, and we believe agility is key as market conditions change. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in economic and trade sanctions that have caused disruptions to global economies and heightened cybersecurity risks, which could impact our future U.S. government defense spending. The long-term outlook for our defense business is influenced by military funding priorities and our ability to evolve products to address a fast-changing threat environment. Our operational management and strategic initiatives are designed to enhance organizational resilience by ensuring we can adapt to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure.

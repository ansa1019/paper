Howmet's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors, including cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals end-use markets. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted global energy markets, leading to high volatility and increasing prices for crude oil, natural gas, and other energy supplies, which results in increases in operating expenses at manufacturing facilities. A material disruption of, or manufacturing difficulties at, Howmet's manufacturing operations could adversely affect the company's ability to effectively meet its obligations to customers. Manufacturing problems arising from equipment failure or malfunction, inadvertent failure to follow regulatory or customer specifications, and problems with raw materials could have an adverse impact on the company's ability to fulfill orders or meet product quality or performance requirements. Howmet is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for materials and services essential to operations, and supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the business. The company faces significant competition, which may have an adverse effect on profitability, and its competitive position and future performance depend on the ability to develop and innovate products, deploy technology initiatives, and implement advanced manufacturing technologies. The loss of key personnel could significantly harm Howmet's business, and any unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions could deplete the company's institutional knowledge base, resulting in loss of technical or other expertise. Howmet's global operations expose it to risks that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the market price of its securities. The company is also subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties, termination of contracts, or increased pricing pressure. The company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past, which may threaten the integrity of its intellectual property and disrupt business operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on Howmet's business, and the nature and extent of the impact over time remain uncertain. The company anticipates that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Howmet's management has focused on actions to improve the cost structure and liquidity, providing the company with the ability to operate effectively. The company has maintained a disciplined approach to cash management, and cash provided from operations is expected to be adequate to cover operational and business needs over the next 12 months. The company has aligned its operations consistent with how the CEO assesses operating performance and allocates capital. The anticipated demand in the commercial aerospace, industrial gas turbine, and oil and gas markets is expected to increase, which could positively impact sales. Howmet's ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical for maintaining operational continuity and ensuring organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

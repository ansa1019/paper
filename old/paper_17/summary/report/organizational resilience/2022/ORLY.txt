Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including deteriorating economic conditions that may adversely impact demand for our products and cause financial hardship for our customers. The economic health of our customers is influenced by factors such as general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, and consumer confidence, which are largely outside of our control. Adverse changes in these factors could lead to decreased demand for our products, negatively impacting our business and financial condition. Our business is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions and natural disasters, which may discourage customer visits to our stores and reduce sales. Business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our ability to deliver inventory, resulting in lost sales or potential loss of customer loyalty. We rely extensively on information technology systems to manage inventory and process transactions, and any failure or interruption of these systems could significantly disrupt our operations. Our ability to respond effectively to disruptions in our supply chain is critical to maintaining our competitive position. We believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve and leverage the value of our brand, which is influenced by perceptions of quality and customer trust. Our operations are also impacted by risks associated with international operations, including compliance with local laws and political conditions. We must attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees to ensure operational effectiveness, as the unexpected loss of key personnel could materially affect our business. Additionally, we face risks related to future acquisitions, which may not lead to expected growth or could result in increased costs. Our long-term business strategy requires capital to invest in new stores, expand distribution infrastructure, and develop enhanced information technology systems. We expect to fund our cash requirements primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings, but there is no assurance that we will maintain liquidity at recent levels. Our ability to meet debt covenants is essential for accessing funds under our credit facility. We utilize a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to manage potential liabilities, and our self-insurance reserves are based on historical claims experience and projected trends. We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment based on projected future cash flows, which involves subjective judgments that could materially impact our assessments. The regulatory environment related to information security and data privacy is complex and constantly evolving, and failure to comply could result in significant costs and reputational damage. Our growth objectives are influenced by external factors, including economic conditions and competition, and we cannot assure that we will achieve our growth plans. The impact of inflationary cost pressures has historically been mitigated through supplier incentive programs and economies of scale, but future increases in acquisition costs could affect our pricing strategies. We believe that our dual market strategy and focus on customer service will support continued demand for our products, despite challenges posed by economic and market conditions.

The ongoing roll out of the covid-19 vaccines and gradual lifting of covid-19 restrictions had a positive impact on our business during fiscal 2022. The impact of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, and therefore, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted. Unexpected events, including global health pandemics such as covid-19, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations. These events could result in customer disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities, or the temporary disruption of information systems. We have an active disaster recovery plan in place that is frequently reviewed and tested. Although we believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related and other potential disruptions, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers. Our ability to attract, develop and retain key employees is a key component of our success. Competitive pressures and labor shortages within and outside our industry may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain key employees which could adversely affect our businesses. We believe that a key component of our success is our corporate culture, which has been imparted by management throughout our corporate organization. Our corporate culture, along with our entire operation, depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key employees. The duration of the pandemic itself and the market and workplace disruptions it has caused, as well as the long-term effects on the economy and our customers are uncertain and as yet unknowable. The ultimate impact of global health pandemics such as the covid-19 pandemic on our consolidated results of operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including the impact of governmental, business and individuals' actions taken in response to such pandemics. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past, but none of these incidents, individually or in the aggregate, have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. If the network of security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems to address these threats to our technology fails, or we are unable to successfully address security incidents, production downtimes, operational delays and interruptions in our ability to provide products and services to our customers could result in financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability and damage to our reputation. Our ability to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals are subject to risks, many of which are outside of our control, and our reputation and brands could be harmed if we fail to meet such goals. The impact of new laws and regulations cannot be predicted. Compliance with new laws and regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines by government authorities, payment of damages to private litigants, or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could adversely affect our ability to service customers and our consolidated results of operations. We regularly review our operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate. The risks and uncertainties described herein are not the only ones we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties presently not known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also harm our business.

The following discussion addresses significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky and provides important information for understanding our operations. We must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity, as significant reductions in demand can lead to increased costs associated with resizing our operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We continue to work to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, and improve our ability to address surges in demand with adequate resources, although we cannot be sure that these measures will fully address service shortcomings. We transport hazardous materials that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion, and a rail accident involving hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties. We rely on technology in all aspects of our business, and if we do not deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire or maintain technology, we may suffer a rail service outage or competitive disadvantage. We are subject to cybersecurity risks, and despite significant resources devoted to protecting our technology systems, we may experience varying degrees of cyber incidents that could materially disrupt our systems. Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena could result in significant business interruptions, adversely affecting our entire rail network and potentially impacting revenues and costs. We are dependent on certain key suppliers, and if they discontinue operations, we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of necessary equipment. Labor disputes and the availability of qualified personnel could also adversely affect our operations, as changes in demographics and training requirements may negatively impact the availability of qualified personnel throughout the supply chain. We are subject to significant governmental regulation, and our failure to comply with applicable laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. Climate change may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity over both the long-term and near-term basis, as violent weather caused by climate change could cause line outages and other interruptions to our infrastructure. We strive to increase reliability of our service product, reduce variability in network operations, and improve resource availability, including actively hiring additional employees. Our capital plan includes investments to support our growth strategy and improve the safety and resilience of the network. We are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity, maintaining adequate resources to meet foreseeable cash requirements. Our ability to generate cash is influenced by various factors, including economic conditions and the impact of public health crises. We expect to continue to have access to liquidity through various sources, including increasing the utilization of our receivables facility and issuing commercial paper. Our strategic initiatives focus on providing consistent and reliable service, efficiently managing operations, and protecting our employees and communities.

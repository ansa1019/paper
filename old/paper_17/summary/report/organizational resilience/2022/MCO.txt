Moody's operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S., including the reform act and the Dodd-Frank act, which are complex and continually evolving. The company's compliance and efforts to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties, or other sanctions can result in significant expenses. Moody's is exposed to risks related to its compliance and risk management programs, and the effectiveness of its policies and procedures to identify, evaluate, and manage risks may not be fully effective. The company faces risks related to protecting its intellectual property rights, which could harm its reputation and affect its competitive advantage. Additionally, the company is subject to legal, economic, operational, and regulatory risks of operating in multiple jurisdictions, which include exposure to exchange rate movements and differing legal or civil liability standards. Moody's ability to conduct business may be materially impacted by disruptions in the infrastructure that supports its operations, including technological infrastructure and data center facilities. The company's customers depend on its ability to handle substantial quantities of data and transactions on computer-based networks, and any significant failure or cyber breach may impair its ability to deliver products and services. The company is also exposed to risks from infrastructure malfunctions or failures, which could disrupt operations and result in losses. The ongoing Russia/Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to declines in rated issuance volumes, impacting the company's financial performance.

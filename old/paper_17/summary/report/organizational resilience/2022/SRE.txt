When evaluating our company and its subsidiaries, we recognize that our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and prospects could be materially adversely affected by risks and uncertainties, including those related to operational and structural risks. Our ability to pay dividends and meet our debt obligations largely depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and entities accounted for as equity method investments, which are separate legal entities that may not be obligated to make distributions to us. The inability to access capital from these entities could have a material adverse effect on our financial health. We are subject to risks arising from aging infrastructure and systems, human error, and supply chain constraints, which may affect our operational flexibility and ability to manage unexpected situations. Our businesses are interconnected with those of third parties, and their operational risks could adversely impact our facilities. Severe weather and natural disasters pose additional risks, potentially disrupting our operations and affecting our ability to provide reliable service. We face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with our infrastructure, which could lead to operational disruptions and regulatory compliance failures. Our businesses are capital-intensive, and we rely on long-term debt to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures. The availability and cost of financing could be negatively affected by market conditions, which may limit our flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities or react to changes in the industry. We continuously assess our risk management procedures, which may not always prevent material losses. Our operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and failure to comply could result in significant penalties or operational curtailments. The changing regulatory environment, particularly concerning climate change and environmental compliance, could materially impact our operations and financial condition. Our businesses are also subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory investigations, which could divert management's attention from strategic initiatives. We have substantial investments in businesses we do not control, exposing us to additional risks, including potential liabilities or losses. Our ability to adapt to changes in the energy landscape, including the transition to renewable energy sources, is critical for maintaining our competitive advantage. We are committed to investing in new technologies and infrastructure to enhance our resilience and operational continuity. Our future performance will depend on our ability to navigate these challenges effectively, ensuring we can respond to external pressures while maintaining our organizational health and effectiveness.

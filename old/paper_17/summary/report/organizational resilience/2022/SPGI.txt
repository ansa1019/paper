The risks and uncertainties described in this annual report should be carefully considered as they could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential data, and breaches may cause material interruptions or malfunctions, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of information regarding us and our customers. We face vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software, and while we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems, there is no assurance that all security measures will provide absolute security. The integration of our businesses following the merger with IHS Markit involves significant costs and challenges that may adversely impact anticipated synergies and our business. Our ability to innovate and compete with new or enhanced products and services is crucial for maintaining a competitive position in rapidly changing markets. The rapid change of technology necessitates the deployment of improved processes and technology to innovate and support new products, which requires effective collaboration across various divisions. Disruptions in our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, especially if they result from human error, natural disasters, or cyber incidents. We have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities, but our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be effective. Our ability to attract and retain key qualified personnel is critical for developing and delivering successful products and services, and challenges in this area could adversely affect our strategic goals. The legal and regulatory environment is evolving, and compliance with privacy and data protection laws is increasingly complex, which may impact our operations and expose us to risks. Our business is also impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the financial markets, which can introduce uncertainty and affect business confidence. The ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has introduced volatility and uncertainty into the global markets, potentially impacting our business operations. We are subject to numerous legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries that could impose additional expenses and require management's attention. Our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by disruptions in the infrastructure that supports our operations, and we continuously assess and improve our business continuity plans. The geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, and reputational risks, including changes in foreign laws and regulations. Our expansion into new markets requires significant investment and attention from management, and there can be no assurance of success in these efforts. The dynamic nature of our business environment necessitates a focus on risk management, compliance, and control to ensure operational resilience and adaptability to changing conditions.

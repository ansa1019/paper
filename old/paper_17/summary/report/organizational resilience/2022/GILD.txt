In evaluating our business, it is important to consider the risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial results. Our operations could be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks. The dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to predict revenues or supply needs, which impacts our operational flexibility and ability to adapt to unexpected situations. We face significant challenges in accurately forecasting sales due to fluctuations in purchasing patterns, particularly in the non-retail sector, which can cause quarter-over-quarter variations that do not reflect actual patient demand. Our reliance on third-party vendors for the collection and delivery of products introduces additional risks, as disruptions could affect our ability to meet operational objectives. The introduction of new products and the expansion of existing product indications are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring organizational health. We must continue to demonstrate the advantages of our therapies to the medical community and adapt to evolving market conditions and regulatory environments. Our strategic initiatives include maximizing revenue growth and expanding our oncology programs, which require effective resource allocation and management of operational resources. The complexities of drug development and commercialization necessitate a robust approach to risk assessment and mitigation. We are also subject to significant pricing pressures from government agencies and third-party payers, which can impact our financial performance and necessitate adjustments to our business strategy. Our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel is essential for fostering innovation and maintaining operational continuity. Additionally, we face risks associated with global operations, including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and potential disruptions from natural disasters or public health emergencies. Cybersecurity incidents pose further threats to our organizational resilience, as they can compromise sensitive data and disrupt operations. Our success depends on our ability to navigate these challenges, maintain strong relationships with third parties, and effectively manage our supply chain. The evolving landscape of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters presents additional operational and reputational risks that could impact our strategic goals. We are committed to adapting our practices to meet stakeholder expectations while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. Our ability to respond to these multifaceted challenges will determine our organizational resilience and capacity to thrive in a turbulent business environment.

A significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand. Factors that may affect such demand include increased mergers, consolidations or exits that reduce the number of communications service providers, the financial condition of communications service providers, and disruptions in the financial and credit markets. The ability and willingness of wireless and cloud service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure is crucial. Our growth projections are based on future revenue from a small number of customers, and such projections could be adversely impacted by adverse changes in their creditworthiness and financial strength. The current inflationary and high interest rate environment could materially and adversely affect our customers through disruptions in their ability to procure equipment and maintain liquidity. Financial difficulties could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and impairments of our assets. We depend on the continued financial strength of our customers, many of whom operate with substantial levels of debt. Our international operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and compliance with various laws and regulations. The ongoing transition from 2G to 4G technology in certain markets, such as India, has included a period of carrier consolidation, which we believe has resulted in a more constructive industry structure. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We must safeguard our customers' infrastructure and equipment located in our data centers and ensure operational continuity at all times. Problems at our data centers could result in service interruptions or significant infrastructure damage, which could impair our ability to meet service level commitments to customers. Our customers may experience difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems. We are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems to mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access and data breaches. The emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, and our ability to innovate in response to these developments is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. Our strategic initiatives involve risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired assets and ensuring operational flexibility. We must also adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs to sustain our business. The financial performance of our operations is influenced by our ability to manage risks effectively and to deploy resources strategically. Our liquidity and ability to fund capital expenditures depend on our capacity to generate cash flow from operating activities and maintain compliance with debt covenants. We are committed to enhancing our organizational resilience through proactive measures and strategic foresight to navigate complex situations and ensure long-term sustainability.

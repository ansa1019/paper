The company is in the process of implementing a comprehensive, multi-year technology and operating model transformation across multiple areas of the business in an effort to modernize its processes and create efficiencies. This technology transformation will include the implementation of certain new systems. The company is performing this implementation in the ordinary course of business to increase efficiency and to modernize the tools and technology used in its key financial processes. The company has modified certain processes and procedures to enhance the quality of internal control over financial reporting. The company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, confirm there has been no change in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company’s IT capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The company focuses on information management capability—that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. The notion of IT capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. The company’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The company’s ongoing evaluation of its business relationships, such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives, aims to identify potential variable interest entities. The company has concluded that consolidation of any such entity is not appropriate for the periods presented. The company’s strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology platforms, which are distinct from the franchise agreement because they do not require integration with other goods or services that the company provides. The company provides goods or services related to various technology platforms to certain franchisees, and the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the consolidated statement of income. The company’s technology infrastructure and IT governance are integral to its operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, facilitating business process optimization and enhancing overall firm performance. The company’s strategic management practices are designed to align its technology capabilities with business strategy, ensuring that IT investments contribute to competitive advantage and market agility. The company continues to monitor and modify the design and operating effectiveness of key control activities to align with the updated business processes and capabilities of the new financial systems.

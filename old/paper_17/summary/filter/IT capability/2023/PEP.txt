The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has resulted in increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, which could adversely affect our business. Our ability to innovate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase, and consume them, is critical. We are focused on leveraging technology, including artificial intelligence and data analytics, to develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies. Our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by geopolitical events, wars, and other military conflicts, which can negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues. We depend on information systems and technology for many activities important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers, ordering and managing inventory, managing and operating our facilities, protecting confidential information, maintaining accurate financial records, and complying with regulatory requirements. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, and the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems are constantly evolving. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business could be adversely affected, resulting in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and lost revenues. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may increase our cybersecurity risks. We have experienced and could continue to experience disruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain, which can adversely affect our business. Our reliance on third-party service providers for certain areas of our business, including information technology support services, can also lead to business disruption and systems performance degradation if these providers fail to meet their contractual obligations. We are currently undergoing a multi-year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems to enterprise-wide solutions, which may result in systems outages and operating inefficiencies. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers may complicate our efforts to address issues that arise. Our technology infrastructure must be robust to support our operational needs and strategic initiatives, including our commitment to sustainability and efficiency improvements. We continue to invest in technology capabilities to enhance our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. Our strategic management practices involve leveraging technology to optimize our processes and improve our organizational effectiveness. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving our business objectives. We recognize that the effective management of our information systems and technology resources is critical to our overall performance and ability to respond to market dynamics.

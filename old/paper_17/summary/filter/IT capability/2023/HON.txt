Information technology capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The company focuses on information management capability, which is the ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailoring these in response to changing business needs and directions. IT capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. The firm’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding, and human resources to further organizational goals. The company recognizes that its IT systems are critical for processing, transmitting, and storing electronic information, managing or supporting various business processes and activities. The cybersecurity risk management program is designed to assess, identify, manage, and govern material risks from cybersecurity threats, which are integrated into the overall enterprise risk management program. The company maintains cybersecurity policies and procedures in accordance with industry standard control frameworks and applicable regulations, laws, and standards. Honeywell's board is responsible for cybersecurity risk oversight and has delegated such oversight to the audit committee, which regularly reports on information technology and cybersecurity matters. The company seeks to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate cybersecurity threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, and continuous monitoring of IT networks and systems. The effectiveness of Honeywell's internal control over financial reporting is assessed regularly, and it is determined that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The organization continues to monitor the activities in corporate and all other areas to determine the need for further reportable business segment disaggregation. The company also recognizes the importance of strategic resource allocation and investment opportunities in enhancing its IT capabilities, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and operational efficiency. The firm aims to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets, which requires effective management of its IT resources and capabilities. The company’s investment in IT infrastructure and governance is critical for supporting its business transformation initiatives and achieving desired performance outcomes. The integration of digital technologies into business processes is seen as a key driver for innovation and operational flexibility, allowing the firm to respond effectively to market dynamics and consumer demands.

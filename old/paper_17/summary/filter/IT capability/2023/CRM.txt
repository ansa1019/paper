The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Any breaches in our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the internet that cause unauthorized access to a customer's data, our data, or our IT systems, or the blockage or disablement of authorized access to our services, may result in significant reputational harm, legal exposure, and liabilities. Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers' and their customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial, health, and personal information. Our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes, and internal security controls is crucial in mitigating these risks. The dependency of our services on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties exposes us to risks inherent in international operations. Our ability to compete effectively in the intensely competitive markets in which we participate is critical, and any failure to expand our services and develop and integrate our existing services to keep pace with technological developments could harm our business. The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented, requiring continuous innovation and adaptation to maintain a competitive advantage. Our success depends on our ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively to support business needs and enhance operational efficiency. The evolving regulatory landscape regarding data privacy and cybersecurity may impose additional burdens on our operations and affect our ability to deliver services globally. The introduction of new data privacy laws and regulations may require us to make changes to our practices and services, potentially increasing our liability exposure. Our strategic investments in technology startups and system integrators are aimed at enhancing our capabilities and expanding our solution ecosystem. However, these investments carry risks, including the potential for significant changes in the fair value of our portfolio. We must continuously enhance our service offerings to meet customer demands and respond to market dynamics. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is essential for maintaining our operational capabilities and driving innovation. The complexity of our services and technologies necessitates a skilled workforce, and competition for talent in the technology industry remains intense. Our restructuring plan aimed at reducing operating costs and improving margins may impact our ability to attract and retain employees. We face challenges in integrating acquired technologies and ensuring that they meet the quality standards consistent with our brand and reputation. Our operational flexibility is vital for responding to changing market conditions and customer needs, and we must invest in our infrastructure to support growth. The effectiveness of our IT governance and management practices will be critical in navigating the challenges posed by cybersecurity threats and regulatory requirements. We must also consider the impact of external factors, such as geopolitical developments and economic conditions, on our business performance and strategic decisions. Our ability to execute on our business plan and achieve our financial targets is contingent upon effectively managing these risks and leveraging our IT capabilities to drive business transformation.

Our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our systems, facilities, and business functions, as well as the operation of various third-party systems. The shut-down, disruption, degradation, or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. Many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, and an interruption or degradation of service from a third-party system could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions, including customer interactions and access to company or customer data. We must maintain a brand and reputation that is recognized and trusted by consumers, and our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services, which may include technological advances, is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position. Our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex technology systems, and we rely on third-party systems and applications to run our operations and to store significant volumes of data. Cybersecurity risks are a significant concern, as our systems are subject to cyber-attacks by third parties, which are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. We undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive information, but our efforts may not be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the effects of such events. Our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors' initiatives is essential, as technological and societal changes may lead to changes in customers' preferences. Our increasing reliance on third-party systems, including cloud computing environments and software as a service applications, presents additional risks. The complexity of our products and systems, driven by ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, and informational developments, creates barriers to innovation or the provision of high-quality products and customer experiences. We must effectively manage this complexity to execute our business strategies successfully. Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talent with strong technological and analytical skills necessary for us to run our insurance businesses and adapt to technological trends. Our financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to access our cash accounts or convert investments into cash on favorable terms. The performance of our investment portfolios is subject to various risks, including market conditions and the performance of third parties with which we enter into significant contracts. Our ability to comply with complex privacy and security regulations is critical, and any failure to comply could result in significant monetary payments, fines, and damage to our reputation. The development and use of new technology, including artificial intelligence, present additional risks that could adversely affect our business. We are subject to evolving regulatory standards regarding the use of technology and data, and our ability to respond to these changes is essential for maintaining our competitive position. Our business is highly competitive, and we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized companies and new entrants with technological innovations. The ability to discern market conditions and respond appropriately is crucial for our financial performance and operational effectiveness.

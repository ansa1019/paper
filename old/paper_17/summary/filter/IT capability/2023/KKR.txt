Investing in our securities involves risk, and the performance and value of the investments held by us and our investment vehicles are materially affected by market and economic conditions or events throughout the world. Difficult market and economic conditions can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. We operate an investment management business where we manage investment vehicles that invest in alternative asset classes and also conduct a related capital markets business. The attractiveness of our investment vehicles and insurance products to investors is influenced by our ability to raise capital for new or successor funds on attractive terms. The competitive landscape is characterized by intense rivalry, where competition for investors in our investment vehicles is based primarily on investment performance, investor liquidity, and the quality of services provided. Our investment management and insurance businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. 

We depend on the efforts, skills, reputations, business contacts, and conduct of our employees, and our ability to retain and recruit talented employees is crucial for maintaining our competitive position. Our success is highly dependent upon our employees and other key personnel, whose loss could jeopardize our relationships with investors and result in a reduction of assets under management or investment opportunities. The reliance on third-party service providers for significant operational support exposes us to operational, reputational, and other risks, particularly if these processes or systems do not operate properly. 

Our investment activities have significant liquidity requirements, and changes in debt or equity markets may materially and adversely affect our investment activities. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from realizations of investments to fund our liquidity needs. The valuation of our investments is subject to significant uncertainty, and changes in market conditions can materially impact the valuations of our portfolio companies. Our insurance business, through global atlantic, faces risks associated with market volatility and economic conditions, which can adversely affect our ability to grow and maintain profitability. 

Our insurance business relies on technology and information systems to manage operations and investments effectively. Cybersecurity threats and data breaches pose risks to our information technology infrastructure, potentially disrupting our operations and impacting our financial condition. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies presents both opportunities and risks, as reliance on these technologies may expose us to new operational, legal, and regulatory challenges. 

The evolving regulatory landscape, particularly regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, requires us to adapt our compliance frameworks and may increase operational costs. Our ability to manage investments effectively is influenced by our technological capabilities, which are essential for processing and evaluating transactions across markets and geographies in a timely and accurate manner. The integration of technology in our investment strategies and operational processes is critical for achieving competitive advantage and enhancing organizational effectiveness.
Any failure to meet applicable requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject Global Atlantic to examination or corrective action by regulators, including limitations on Global Atlantic's writing additional business or engaging in finance activities, supervision, receivership or liquidation. New statutory accounting guidance or changes or clarifications in interpretations of existing guidance may adversely impact our insurance subsidiaries, including by limiting our ability to originate, or invest in, certain assets on behalf of our insurance subsidiaries or causing our insurance subsidiaries to increase their required capital in respect of such assets, thus making such asset exposures less attractive to our insurance subsidiaries, which may materially and adversely affect our business. The determination of RBC is based on the NAIC designation of the assets in which Global Atlantic invests. NAIC designation for certain investments depends on the applicable NRSRO rating. If there are changes in an NRSRO's methodology, Global Atlantic's ability to invest in such assets may be impacted and Global Atlantic's investment results may be adversely impacted, or Global Atlantic may need to increase its required capital. Regulators continue to propose or adopt fiduciary rules, best interest standards and other similar laws and regulations applicable to the sale of retirement and life insurance products, including the Department of Labor's October 2023 proposal redefining the scope of "investment advice fiduciary" under ERISA. These rules, standards, laws and regulations generally require advisers providing investment recommendations to act in the client's best interest or put the client's interest ahead of their own interest. Global Atlantic faces uncertainty regarding the adoption of these rules and regulations, including that the SEC, Department of Labor and state insurance departments may adopt potentially conflicting or overlapping standards. The cost of compliance with existing laws and regulations, including capital requirements, is high, and the cost of compliance with any changed, new or additional regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our insurance business, including further restricting our ability to conduct business and our ability to continue to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which could impact Global Atlantic's potential growth and could subject Global Atlantic to fines and other sanctions. Our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the BMA that may restrict their operations, and we cannot guarantee that insurance supervisors in the United States or elsewhere will not in the future assert that our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries are subject to additional licensing requirements. The Bermuda insurance act and the policies of and/or other codes issued by the BMA relevant to insurers require each of our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries to maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus; satisfy solvency standards; comply with restrictions on dividends; obtain prior approval or provide notification to the BMA of changes in shareholder controller shares; make financial statement filings; prepare a financial condition report; maintain a head office in Bermuda from which each of our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries' insurance business will be directed and managed; and allow for the performance of certain periodic examinations of its financial condition. These statutes and regulations may restrict Global Atlantic's ability to write insurance and reinsurance policies, distribute funds and pursue its investment strategy. Our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries will be exposed to any changes in the political environment in Bermuda. The Bermuda insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework is subject to scrutiny from many jurisdictions. As a result of such overseas scrutiny, the BMA has implemented and imposed additional requirements on the licensed insurance companies it regulates to achieve equivalence under Solvency II, the solvency regime applicable to the EU insurance sector.

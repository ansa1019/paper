JPMorgan Chase's businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of its financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing, and other operational systems to process, record, monitor, and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly, and securely. The effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase's operational systems depends on the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated, or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's operations depend on the competence and integrity of its employees and those of external parties. The ineffectiveness, failure, or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyber breach, or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including delays or other disruptions in providing information, services, and liquidity to clients and customers. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase's connections to external operational systems expose it to greater operational risks, as external operational systems can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. The introduction of new products or services, changes to existing platforms, or the failure to identify operational risks associated with those changes could diminish JPMorgan Chase's ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients, counterparties, and customers. Moreover, JPMorgan Chase's risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk, and any inadequacy or lapse in its risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models, or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses. The quality of JPMorgan Chase's data gathering and validation processes is critical to its risk management practices, and deficiencies in these processes could result in ineffective risk management and inaccurate risk reporting. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which can lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, potentially resulting in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, or other sanctions. The firm must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, and any failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. The ongoing evolution of technology and the emergence of new competitors in the financial services industry necessitate that JPMorgan Chase continuously adapt its operational and technological capabilities to maintain its competitive position. The firm faces significant and increasing competition, and its ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses, and return capital to shareholders is contingent upon effective management of its operational systems and technology infrastructure. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase's operations or operational systems could hinder its ability to provide services to its clients and customers, require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, and expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions.

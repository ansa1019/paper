We face intense competition as our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, with many competitors across geographies and industries, including e-commerce and digital content. Some of our competitors may secure better terms from vendors and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, and marketing. The complexity of our current scale can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, and internal financial controls. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results. Our expansion into new products, services, and technologies subjects us to additional risks, including potential claims if customers experience service disruptions or failures. We experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rates, and our revenue growth may not be sustainable. Our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers is critical, as is our ability to offer products on favorable terms and manage inventory. The introduction of competitive stores and changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet and e-commerce can also impact our business. Our ability to optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers is crucial, as failures to predict customer demand can result in excess or insufficient capacity and increased costs. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory and completed orders, and disruptions from natural or man-made disasters can negatively impact our operations. Our international operations expose us to risks, including local economic and political conditions, government regulation, and compliance with laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, and network security. We face risks related to successfully optimizing and operating our fulfillment network and data centers, as well as risks associated with our commercial agreements and strategic alliances, which require substantial infrastructure capacity and resource commitments. Our technology and content investment is critical for enhancing customer experience and improving process efficiencies, and we expect spending in these areas to increase over time. We seek to invest efficiently in technology infrastructure to support our operations and improve our capabilities. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows, driven by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital. We believe that advances in technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve the consumer experience and increase the ubiquity of the internet. Our ability to manage shareholder dilution while maintaining flexibility for strategic purposes is essential, as is our focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices and increasing product availability. The risks associated with our business, including competition, operational challenges, and regulatory changes, could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.

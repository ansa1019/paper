Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, particularly related to our ability to grow our business in intensely competitive markets. The markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry. As the market for digital workflow products matures and new technologies and competitors enter the market, we expect competition to intensify. Our current competitors include large, well-established enterprise application software vendors and large integrated systems vendors, as well as new entrants developing technologies to solve similar problems. Many competitors may respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, customer requirements, and buying practices. They may utilize acquisitions, integrations, or consolidations to offer integrated or bundled products, enhanced functionality, or other advantages. Furthermore, privacy laws and concerns, evolving regulation of cloud computing, and data transfer restrictions may adversely affect our business. As a cloud-based service provider, we optimize performance by utilizing data centers that may be located in different political jurisdictions, and changing laws could impact our ability to develop products and services. Our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed if we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological, market, and customer developments. We compete in markets that continue to evolve rapidly, and the pace of innovation will accelerate as customers increasingly base their purchases on digital technologies and capabilities. To compete effectively, we must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies, accurately predict our customers' changing business needs, and invest in and continually optimize our technology platform. We must also efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers' digital environments and effectively deliver the business process planning and IT systems architecture planning that our customers require. Delays in the release of new or updated products may slow the adoption of our technologies, reduce our ability to efficiently provide services, and adversely impact sales. We face risks related to the procurement process and compliance with government contracting requirements, especially as we provide products and services to heavily regulated organizations. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team and key individual contributors, and competition for experienced personnel is intense. We also rely on our network of partners for a significant portion of our revenues, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, cyber-attacks, and other events beyond our control, which could harm our ability to deliver services. We have made substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure, and our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position. As we acquire or invest in companies and technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits, and these transactions may divert our management's attention. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of sensitive data, and while we have security measures in place, breaches may occur that could harm our business and operating results.

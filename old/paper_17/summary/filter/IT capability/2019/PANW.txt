Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the need to effectively manage growth and improve our systems, processes, and controls. As we continue to grow, our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently is critical. We must improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and controls. The complexity of our organization increases with growth, requiring effective coordination to avoid increased costs and disruptions to existing customer relationships. Our business performance and operating results may be adversely affected if we fail to manage growth effectively. We have experienced significant growth in our subscription and support offerings, which accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. Our subscription and support revenue is recognized over the term of the relevant service period, and fluctuations in sales of these offerings can impact our operating results. Our ability to attract and retain customers is influenced by various factors, including market dynamics and competition from larger, well-established companies. We face challenges in managing improvements to our systems and processes, particularly in connection with third-party software. Our reliance on channel partners for sales and distribution exposes us to risks if they fail to perform effectively. Additionally, we must navigate the complexities of international operations and regulatory environments, which can impact our ability to compete and grow. Our technology capabilities are essential for maintaining our competitive position, and we continue to invest in research and development to enhance our product offerings. The introduction of new technologies and the expansion of our platform are vital for meeting customer needs and improving our market position. We must also ensure that our technical support services are of high quality, as they significantly affect customer satisfaction and retention. Our future success depends on our ability to effectively manage our IT capabilities, including the integration of new technologies and the optimization of our operational processes. We recognize that our IT architecture must evolve to support our business strategies and enhance our operational efficiency. The growth of our installed customer base and the adoption of our cloud-based offerings are critical to our long-term success. We must also address the challenges posed by competitive pressures and the need for continuous innovation in our product development efforts. Our ability to leverage strategic resources and manage our technology portfolio effectively will be crucial in navigating the competitive landscape and achieving sustainable growth.

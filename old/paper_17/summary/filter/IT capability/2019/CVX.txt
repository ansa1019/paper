Chevron's operations are subject to numerous risks, including those associated with cybersecurity and the integrity of its information technology (IT) systems. The company recognizes that cyberattacks targeting its process control networks or other digital infrastructure could materially impact its business and results of operations. Chevron faces evolving risks to its cybersecurity from various threat actors, including criminal hackers and state-sponsored intrusions, which may compromise its IT systems and data. Despite significant resource allocation to prevent intrusions and protect its systems, the company continues to experience cyber incidents that can disrupt business operations, harm the environment, and lead to the loss or corruption of critical data. The company has limited control over third-party IT systems, which can also be compromised, introducing vulnerabilities to its own IT infrastructure. The implications of these cyber threats extend to financial losses, legal liabilities, and reputational harm, potentially affecting the company's overall performance and operational efficiency. 

Chevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential risks to its operations and assets, including those related to IT capabilities. The company integrates considerations of cybersecurity into its capital investment reviews and decision-making processes, recognizing the importance of IT capability in supporting business strategies and enhancing operational resilience. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively is crucial for Chevron to maintain its competitive advantage and respond to market dynamics. Furthermore, the company acknowledges that the effectiveness of its IT governance and management practices is essential for ensuring the reliability and security of its information systems. The interplay between operational risks and IT capabilities underscores the necessity for continuous oversight and improvement in technology deployment and infrastructure management to safeguard against disruptions and enhance organizational performance. 

As Chevron navigates the complexities of the energy market, it must also contend with the regulatory landscape, which increasingly emphasizes environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The company's strategic alignment with these considerations is vital for maintaining its market position and addressing stakeholder expectations. The integration of IT capabilities into Chevron's strategic resource allocation and operational processes is critical for optimizing performance outcomes and enhancing the company's resilience in a rapidly changing business environment. The company's commitment to leveraging technology resources effectively is a key component of its broader strategy to achieve sustainable growth and operational excellence.

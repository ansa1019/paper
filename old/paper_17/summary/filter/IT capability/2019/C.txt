Citi's 2019 results reflected steady progress toward improving profitability and returns, driven by strong client engagement and balanced growth across businesses and geographies. The firm demonstrated strong expense discipline, resulting in expenses that were largely unchanged from the prior year, while continuing to make investments in the franchise. Citi's positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline resulted in an improvement in pretax earnings. The firm reported broad-based loan and deposit growth across its Global Consumer Banking (GCB) and Institutional Clients Group (ICG). ICG's revenues increased 3%, reflecting a 1% increase in banking revenues and a 5% increase in markets and securities services revenues. The increase in banking revenues was driven by solid growth in treasury and trade solutions, investment banking, and the private bank. Treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 4%, reflecting strong client engagement and volume growth. ICG's international presence is supported by trading floors in approximately 80 countries and a proprietary network in 98 countries and jurisdictions. The firm’s strategy is to leverage its global footprint and be the pre-eminent bank for affluent consumers in large urban centers. The overall strategy emphasizes optimizing performance to benefit shareholders while remaining flexible and adapting to market and economic conditions. Citi's operating expenses were largely unchanged, as efficiency savings offset volume-driven growth and continued investments in the franchise. The firm’s IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of assets and internal processes, supporting business strategies and enhancing operational efficiency. The focus on information management capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in conjunction with leveraging the value of other organizational capabilities. Citi's investment in technology resources and infrastructure is aimed at enhancing customer relationships and improving business processes. The firm’s ability to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security is critical in responding to changing business needs. The firm’s IT governance and management capabilities are essential for navigating the complexities of the financial environment, ensuring compliance, and optimizing resource allocation. As economic forecasts for 2020 have been lowered, various economic, political, and other risks could create a more volatile operating environment, impacting Citi's businesses and future results. Despite these challenges, Citi intends to continue building on the progress made during 2019, focusing on further optimizing its performance and enhancing its IT capabilities to maintain competitive advantage and market responsiveness. The firm’s commitment to digital transformation and innovation partnerships is integral to its strategy for achieving operational flexibility and improving performance outcomes.

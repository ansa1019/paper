Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the need to effectively manage future growth and improve our systems, processes, and controls. As we have grown, we have increasingly managed more complex deployments of our products and services with larger end-customers. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. We may not be able to successfully scale improvements to our enterprise resource planning system or implement or scale improvements to our other systems, processes, and controls efficiently or in a manner that does not negatively affect our operating results. Our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software, which could disrupt existing customer relationships, cause us to lose customers, limit us to smaller deployments of our products, or increase our technical support costs. Our failure to improve our systems, processes, and controls, or their failure to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business and to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses, and earnings, or to prevent certain losses. We are implementing certain new enterprise management systems, and any failure to implement these systems may disrupt our operations and increase our operating expenses. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing end-customers by selling additional products and securing other areas of our end-customers' networks and endpoints. We rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and services will be limited, and our operating results will be harmed. We are also subject to various risks associated with international sales and operations, including political, economic, and social uncertainty around the world, which could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our growth strategy is dependent, in part, upon increasing sales of our products to medium and large enterprises, which involves risks that may not be present with sales to smaller entities. We must continually introduce new products, services, and technologies and enhance existing products and services to remain competitive. Our ability to sell our products is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and those of our channel partners, and the failure to offer high-quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our end-customers' satisfaction with our products and services, our sales, and our operating results. We must commit significant resources to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, and the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.

The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs; our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies or delivery methods; the ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to lower cost structures and regulatory and legislative actions adverse to us; changes in our corporate strategies, such as changing network requirements or acquisitions and dispositions, which may require significant amounts of cash or stock, to respond to competition and regulatory, legislative and technological developments; our ability to adequately fund our wireless operations, including payment for additional spectrum, network upgrades and technological advancements; and our ability to manage growth in wireless data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms. The impact on our networks, including satellites operated by Directv, and business from major equipment failures; security breaches related to the network or customer information; our inability to obtain handsets, equipment/software or have handsets, equipment/software serviced, and in the case of satellites launched, in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers; or severe weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, energy shortages, wars or terrorist attacks could also affect our operational efficiency. Our ability to integrate our acquisition of Directv and our increased exposure to video competition and foreign economies due to our recent acquisitions, including regulatory and political uncertainty in Latin America, are additional factors influencing our strategic capabilities. The uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions may result in a significant reduction in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general and on our products and services specifically. The final outcome of FCC and other federal or state agency proceedings involving issues that are important to our business, including the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, competition policy, and broadband deployment, will also impact our IT capabilities. Our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition is essential for maintaining our market positioning. The continued development and delivery of attractive and profitable video offerings through satellite and U-verse, the extent to which regulatory and build-out requirements apply to our offerings, and the availability, cost and/or reliability of the various technologies and/or content required to provide such offerings are critical to our operational flexibility and market agility. The issuance by the financial accounting standards board or other accounting oversight bodies of new accounting standards or changes to existing standards may influence our financial activities and investment decisions. Overall, our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is vital for transforming our firm into a competitive force and achieving our organizational goals.

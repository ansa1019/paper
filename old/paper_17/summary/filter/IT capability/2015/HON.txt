Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond and mitigate these threats including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, develop and maintain competitive products and defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors, enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers' needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Our consolidated results are principally impacted by change in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets; overall sales mix, in particular the mix of aerospace original equipment and aftermarket sales and the mix of ACS products, distribution and services sales; and the extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation. We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment.

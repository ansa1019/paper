Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include our ability to develop, market, and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements. The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly, and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand. If we are unable to extend our core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to technological changes, the market's acceptance of our products and services could decline. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance existing products and services, introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, and meet changing customer needs. The introduction of new products, services, and business models by competitors could harm our competitive position and results of operations. The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards, and disruptive technology developments. Our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which depends on customer satisfaction with our products and services. Security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or liability claims. Maintaining the security of our products and networks is critical for us and our customers. Cyber-attackers regularly develop new techniques to penetrate security measures, and the costs to prevent or alleviate security problems are significant. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products and improving our incident response time. We also rely on third-party service providers for hosting and delivering services and data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services could expose us to liability and harm our business. Our reliance on third-party providers increases our vulnerability to disruptions. Our business has shifted towards a subscription model that requires continued investment in product development and cloud operations. This cloud strategy may raise concerns among our customer base regarding information security and service availability. If we cannot adapt our products to new platforms or if significant demand arises for competitive products before we offer our solutions, our business could be harmed. The complexity of our enterprise offerings results in extended sales cycles, which makes it difficult to predict when a sales cycle will close. We face various risks associated with operating as a multinational corporation, including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in government preferences for software procurement. Our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet cash outlays for our restructuring actions. We have significant commitments under operating leases, royalty agreements, and various service agreements. Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration in financial markets, and we actively monitor our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. Our ability to comply with various laws and regulations globally may also impact our business.

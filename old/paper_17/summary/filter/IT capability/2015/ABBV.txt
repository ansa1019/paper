AbbVie relies on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, or breakdown. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of biologics is a long, expensive, and uncertain process, and manufacturing biologics often requires the use of innovative technologies. AbbVie must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. AbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties. The company is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. AbbVie’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of its merger with Pharmacyclics will depend on its ability to effectively and profitably commercialize Imbruvica, including ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers Imbruvica to AbbVie’s customers. The anticipated benefits of AbbVie’s merger with Pharmacyclics will depend on AbbVie’s ability to create and meet continued market demand, achieve market acceptance, and generate product sales. AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company expects to achieve its revenue growth objectives through various means, including driving biologic penetration across disease categories and increasing market leadership. AbbVie’s financial performance in 2015 reflected continued funding in support of AbbVie’s emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets, continued investment in AbbVie’s growth brands, and the global launch of AbbVie’s interferon-free HCV treatment. AbbVie’s products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies, and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. The company’s financial performance in 2015 included delivering fully diluted earnings per share of $3.13. AbbVie’s ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. The company cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future. AbbVie’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers. AbbVie believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements, and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.

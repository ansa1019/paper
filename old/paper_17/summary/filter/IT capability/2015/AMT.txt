Our business relies on information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational, reporting, and compliance activities and to maintain our business records. We utilize IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance operational efficiency. Our computer systems are subject to interruption or damage from various risks, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, and security breaches, which could impact our ability to provide services to our tenants. We maintain disaster recovery programs and security measures; however, if our systems are compromised or cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations or allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information. The integration of acquired or leased assets involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results, disrupt operations, or expose us to additional risks. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations and personnel, which is critical for leveraging our IT capabilities effectively. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks, influenced by the growth of wireless services and the financial performance of our tenants. The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution, compelling our tenants to deploy additional equipment across their existing networks. Our holistic master lease agreements with certain tenants provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn, enhancing our strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility. We also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect our ability to plan, forecast, and budget for our international operations. Our revenues from international operations are primarily denominated in local currencies, and fluctuations can negatively impact our reported revenues and operating profits. The development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks could reduce the need for tower-based wireless services, thereby decreasing demand for tower space and impacting our revenue. Additionally, our business is subject to government regulations that could restrict our ability to operate as we currently do, affecting our strategic management practices and operational effectiveness. Our ongoing contractual revenues may be negatively impacted if a significant number of tenant leases are not renewed, which could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and impairments of our assets. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants, and any failure by these tenants to perform their obligations could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is dependent on maintaining recurring revenue and converting it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs. The financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital are critical factors influencing our operational capabilities and market responsiveness.

Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to the evolving economic and regulatory environment, which significantly impacts our strategies and operational capabilities. We face competition in the credit card market from other consumer financial services providers, including non-traditional providers such as financial technology firms, which affects our ability to attract and retain customers. The consumer financial services business is highly competitive, and we compete on various factors, including brand, reputation, customer service, product offerings, and technology functionalities. Our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high charge-off rates is critical, as it may be adversely affected by economic conditions and the effectiveness of our risk management framework. We rely on technology to deliver services, and disruptions in technology services or the internet could negatively impact our ability to process transactions and serve our customers. Our operational and other risk management frameworks seek to identify and mitigate risks, including those related to technology and compliance, which are essential for maintaining organizational effectiveness. The implementation of technology changes and upgrades is necessary to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and any failure in this area could disrupt our business operations. We are also subject to increasing cybersecurity threats, which require ongoing investment in our information security and business continuity programs to protect sensitive customer information. Our ability to develop and implement innovative technology solutions is vital for executing our strategy to be a leading direct bank and payments partner. The regulatory environment continues to evolve, with increased scrutiny on compliance and operational processes, which may require us to invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts. Our strategic decisions regarding investments in technology and infrastructure are crucial for enhancing our operational efficiency and maintaining competitive advantage. We continuously monitor our liquidity and funding needs, ensuring we have adequate resources to support our business operations and respond to market dynamics. The integration of new technologies and the management of third-party service providers are essential for maintaining the reliability of our services and protecting our brand reputation. Our ongoing investments in infrastructure and technology are necessary to support our growth initiatives and adapt to changing market conditions. We must effectively empower, integrate, and deploy our management and operational resources to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy in an increasingly dynamic and competitive economic and regulatory environment. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to leverage technology capabilities, manage risks associated with operational processes, and maintain strong relationships with our customers and partners.

ExxonMobil's financial and operating results are subject to various risks that can affect its business, including technological improvements in energy efficiency and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices. The company emphasizes the importance of operational efficiency, which is critical for competitive performance, requiring continuous management focus, including technology improvements and productivity enhancements. The success of ExxonMobil's upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses relies on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects that necessitate a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. The ability to manage expenses and improve production yields is essential, and this requires ongoing technology improvements and the recruitment, development, and retention of high-caliber employees. Research and development are vital for maintaining competitive positioning, particularly in adapting to changing market and policy environments, including the development of technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The company recognizes that cybersecurity breaches pose significant risks, as insufficient protection against such risks could lead to compromised business systems, altered or lost proprietary information, and disrupted operations. ExxonMobil's management effectiveness is crucial for navigating external economic and political factors, impacting performance relative to competition. The company's ability to adapt and apply its strengths to provide future energy products in a cost-competitive manner is dependent on successful research efforts and the effective management of its technological capabilities. Furthermore, the company acknowledges that its operations may be disrupted by severe weather events and natural disasters, necessitating robust facility engineering and rigorous disaster preparedness and response planning. The integration of technology into operational processes is essential for enhancing efficiency and achieving organizational goals, while also addressing community priorities and regulatory requirements.

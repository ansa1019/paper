Ongoing changes in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, expose our business to significant risks. The semiconductor equipment industry is constantly developing and changing, and if we fail to timely develop new technologies and products that successfully anticipate and address these changes, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. The increasing cost of building and operating fabrication facilities impacts our customers' investment decisions, while the emergence of disruptive technologies alters prevailing semiconductor manufacturing processes, affecting inspection and metrology requirements. Our management monitors trends such as differing market growth rates and capital requirements for various applications, as well as the higher design costs for advanced integrated circuits, which may constrain leading-edge manufacturing technology customers. The concentration of our customer base, particularly in the semiconductor industry, increases our exposure to risks related to the financial condition of each customer. Semiconductor manufacturers must commit significant resources to qualify, install, and integrate process control and yield management equipment, which can lead to reliance on specific suppliers for extended periods. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry is largely driven by our customers' capital spending patterns and their need for expanded manufacturing capacity, influenced by factors such as consumer demand and inventory levels. Our ability to recognize revenue from customers may be negatively impacted by their funding status, which can be affected by adverse business conditions or inaccessibility to capital markets. We must continue to make significant investments in research and development to enhance the performance, features, and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and satisfy customer demands. Our competitive advantage and future success depend on our ability to accurately predict evolving industry standards and develop new products that address changing customer needs. The complexity of our products exposes us to risks, as unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs, including increased service or warranty costs and potential litigation. Our future operating results will depend significantly on our ability to produce products and provide services that have a competitive advantage in our marketplace. We believe that substantial and focused investments in our research and development are essential to address the yield challenges our customers face at future technology nodes. Our management provides quarterly forecasts for financial metrics based on operational forecasts, but actual results may vary due to unexpected changes in customer orders or market conditions. Our ability to operate effectively is also influenced by our reliance on third-party service providers for information systems management, which can affect our operational flexibility and response to changing market conditions. Cybersecurity threats pose a risk to our information systems, as we collect and store sensitive data, and any breaches could disrupt operations and result in reputational damage. Our global operations depend on critical information systems, and any disruptions could adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes. We are committed to managing our technology resources and capabilities effectively to enhance our operational efficiency and maintain our competitive position in the market.

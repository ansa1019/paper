The rapid development of new technologies, services, and products has eliminated many traditional distinctions among communication services and brought new competitors to the market, necessitating a strong IT capability to effectively support business needs. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our network quality, capacity, coverage, pricing of products and services, and the quality of customer service, all of which are influenced by our IT capabilities. We must adapt to changes and disruptions in technology to address changing consumer demand, as failure to do so may result in reduced demand for our services and hinder our business strategy implementation. The introduction of new technologies and offerings is essential to meet customer demands, and we must phase out outdated technologies to maintain competitiveness. Our dependence on key suppliers and vendors for critical technology components underscores the importance of our IT capabilities in maintaining operational efficiency and service provision. Cyber attacks pose a significant risk to our IT systems, potentially causing disruptions and loss of sensitive information, which could adversely affect our business operations and customer trust. The effectiveness of our IT governance and management practices is crucial in mitigating these risks and ensuring the reliability and security of our information systems. Furthermore, regulatory changes can impact our operational flexibility and ability to innovate, emphasizing the need for robust IT capabilities to navigate these challenges. Our organizational capabilities, including technology management and process optimization, are vital for enhancing performance and achieving strategic objectives. The integration of IT resources with other organizational assets is necessary for effective resource mobilization and to leverage competitive advantages. As we face increasing competition and market dynamics, our IT capabilities will play a critical role in transforming our business processes and enhancing our overall performance. The ability to provide timely and accurate information to users is essential for informed decision-making and maintaining operational efficiency. Our investment in IT infrastructure and capabilities is fundamental to our strategic resource allocation and the development of new offerings that align with market demands. The ongoing evolution of our IT capabilities is essential for sustaining our competitive positioning and achieving long-term business success.

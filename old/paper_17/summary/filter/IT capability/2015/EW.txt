Our business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty, including the need for regulatory clearance and the introduction of new products, which can impact our IT capabilities. We contract with third parties for important services related to infrastructure and information technology, which are critical for maintaining operational efficiency and supporting our business processes. The cardiovascular products industry is characterized by technological changes, and our ability to market new products is limited by various factors, including regulatory requirements and competition. We devote significant financial and other resources to our research and development activities, which are essential for enhancing our IT capabilities and driving innovation. The introduction of new technologies and the ability to keep pace with competitors are vital for maintaining our competitive advantage. Our success is measured by the development of innovative therapies and the value they bring to our stakeholders, necessitating a strong focus on information management capability to provide accurate, timely, and reliable data to users. We face challenges in establishing additional or replacement sources for materials and components, which can affect our operational flexibility and resource management. Our manufacturing processes are complex and subject to strict quality controls, where disruptions can occur during the implementation of new systems or equipment. The need for effective information technology systems is underscored by our reliance on proprietary intellectual property, which is dependent on sophisticated IT infrastructure. Cybersecurity threats pose risks to our sensitive company information, and we continuously invest to protect our intellectual property and enhance our systems. Our competitive position can be adversely affected by product problems and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of quality and effective IT governance in the medical device industry. We regularly explore potential acquisitions and strategic alliances to enhance our technology portfolio, which requires significant management resources and can result in unforeseen operating difficulties. The regulatory approval process for new products requires extensive clinical trials and procedures, and unfavorable clinical data can adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary approvals. Our operations are subject to rigorous governmental regulations, and failure to comply could lead to substantial sanctions, impacting our business performance. We anticipate that market demand, governmental regulation, and societal pressures will continue to change the healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances that may exert downward pressure on our prices. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our capacity to develop and acquire new products and technologies, anticipate technological advances, and maintain strong relationships with key stakeholders. The introduction of cost containment incentives by third-party payors can adversely affect our ability to profitably sell our products, highlighting the need for strategic alignment in our business strategies. As we expand into new markets, we may face unanticipated surges in demand that could strain our production capacity, necessitating agile responses and effective resource allocation. The evolving landscape of the medical technology industry requires us to continuously adapt our IT capabilities to meet changing business needs and directions.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including technological changes and events. The success of our strategies may be affected by market fluctuations and by economic, political, and other factors, including technological changes. We believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of many of our businesses, and poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth. Our businesses have been adversely affected by U.S. and global capital market and credit crises, equity market volatility, and stress or recession in the U.S. and global economies generally. Our financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by the availability and cost of capital, the level and volatility of equity prices, and changes in consumer economic variables. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent, and our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified people, particularly financial advisors and portfolio managers. Our operational systems and networks have been, and will continue to be, subject to evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client information and damage to our reputation. Maintaining the integrity of these systems and networks is critical to the success of our business operations. We routinely encounter and address cybersecurity threats, including phishing scams and unauthorized payment requests. Changes in our client base, the mix of assets under management, and technology platform changes may require corresponding changes in our systems, networks, and data security measures. The increasing reliance on technology systems and networks has enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cybersecurity threats. We cannot assure that our systems and networks will not be subject to attacks, breaches, or interference, which may result in operational disruptions and unauthorized access to sensitive information. We rely on third-party service providers and vendors for certain communications, technology, and business functions, and we face the risk of operational failure, including failure caused by inaccuracies or deficiencies in data reporting. Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures, but these methods may not predict future exposures accurately. Our ability to manage operational, legal, and regulatory risks requires effective policies and procedures, which may not be fully effective in all market environments. We are also subject to the risk of nonperformance or inadequate performance of contractual obligations by third-party vendors of products and services used in our businesses. The establishment of reserves for future policy benefits and claims is an estimation process that requires management to make assumptions about future experience, which are inherently uncertain. Our insurance companies are required by law to maintain certain capital levels, and changes in the regulatory environment may impact our ability to operate effectively. We use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks, and the fair value of these derivatives is determined using market quotes or valuation models. The fair value of our liabilities is adjusted based on observable market data to reflect nonperformance risk. Our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and cash generated by our operations, and we believe that our resources are adequate to meet anticipated obligations.

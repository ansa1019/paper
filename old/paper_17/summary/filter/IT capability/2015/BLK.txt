BlackRock's infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. The sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via the Aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients are an important element of BlackRock's competitive success. Aladdin's competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine sophisticated risk analytics with comprehensive portfolio management, trading, and operations tools on a single platform. BlackRock relies on its ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. The analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin analytical calculations. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or information, or disruption of such information flows, could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock's ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. BlackRock's management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of assets under management (AUM). The company continuously monitors and develops its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock's operations and cause financial losses. A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures, and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline. BlackRock's ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its ability to maintain and grow AUM, its creditworthiness, and operating cash flows. The company is subject to extensive regulation around the world, and these regulations subject BlackRock's business activities to a pervasive array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly, time-consuming, and complex. BlackRock's ability to attract and retain highly talented professionals is largely dependent on the company's reputation, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession. The company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees, or vendors. BlackRock's success is also dependent on its ability to develop, market, and manage new investment products and services, which require continued innovative efforts and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. The company continues to invest in technology, training, and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures. BlackRock's diversified platform enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management.

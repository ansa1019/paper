BlackRock's infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. The sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via the Aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients are an important element of BlackRock's competitive success. Aladdin's competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine sophisticated risk analytics with comprehensive portfolio management, trading, and operations tools on a single platform. The failure to maintain Aladdin's competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock's productivity and growth. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions may weaken Aladdin's competitive position and may cause the company's revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures, and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline. The company collaborates with clients, vendors, and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information. Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines, and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm, or legal liability. BlackRock's ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform is crucial. The analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin analytical calculations. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or information, or disruption of such information flows, could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock's ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. The company continues to invest in technology, training, and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures. BlackRock's management believes that the company will be able to continue to grow AUM organically by focusing on strong investment performance, efficient delivery of beta for index products, client service, developing new products, and optimizing distribution capabilities. The development and introduction of new products and services require continued innovative efforts on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. BlackRock's ability to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to additional costs or operational risk. The company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees, or vendors. BlackRock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues; however, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex, and if the company fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, or penalties, fines, and/or sanctions.

We depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. government for a substantial portion of our business, with 71% of our total net sales derived from government contracts in 2016. The U.S. government continues to face significant deficit reduction pressures, which may constrain discretionary spending for several years. Our largest program, the F-35, represented 23% of our total net sales in 2016, and we anticipate continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the Department of Defense and congressional oversight processes. Current program challenges include supplier and partner performance, software development, and successfully negotiating and receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats and disruptions that could adversely affect our internal operations and the services we provide to our customers. Our business strategy focuses on program execution, improving quality and predictability of product delivery, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our customers. We continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people to ensure we have the necessary technical skills. The integration of our products and technologies with those of acquired businesses, such as Sikorsky, is expected to enhance our capabilities and customer relationships. Our operations are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, which impose risks and costs on our business. We must comply with laws relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, and a violation could harm our reputation and result in penalties or loss of contracts. Our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of contracts undertaken, our performance, and our ability to control costs. We have a strategy to grow international sales, which involves strengthening relationships through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is subject to numerous political and economic factors, regulatory requirements, and significant competition. We are committed to maintaining strong customer relationships and providing advanced technology solutions at affordable costs. Our contracts generally record sales for products and services under cost-reimbursable, fixed-price, and time-and-materials contracts, with the majority of our net sales accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method. We evaluate new or significantly modified contracts to determine if individual deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. We closely monitor compliance with our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting, which requires significant estimates and assumptions. Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties, including potential liabilities related to environmental cleanup issues and the performance of our products and services. The ability to recover investments made to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control. Our success depends on our ability to develop new products and technologies, maintain a qualified workforce, and manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business.

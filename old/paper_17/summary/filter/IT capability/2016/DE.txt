In addition, as security threats continue to evolve, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems. John deere is subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection.

John deere collects personally identifiable information (pii) and other data as an integral part of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the european union, canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of pii and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction that are more restrictive than those in the u.s. Additionally, in may 2016, the european union adopted the general data protection regulation that will impose more stringent data protection requirements and will provide for greater penalties for noncompliance beginning in may 2018. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us or company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.

The company is increasingly reliant on technological systems, such as point-of-sale and other in-store systems or platforms, as well as technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration internally, with affiliated entities, or with independent third parties to conduct its business, including technology-enabled solutions provided by third parties. Any failure of these systems could significantly impact operations and customer perceptions. Despite the implementation of security measures, technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability, or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events. The company faces risks associated with information technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of network security that may interrupt operations. Security breaches involving the company’s systems or the systems of third-party providers may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The occurrence of any of these incidents could result in adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, and criminal penalties or civil liabilities.

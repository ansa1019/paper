In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks that could affect our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition. Our operational and security systems, infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, are integral to our performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day operations, and our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by significant disruptions. Cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased, and our businesses rely on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential information. We continuously update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws, which entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, and we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to various types of risk, including operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems. We employ a comprehensive approach to risk management, which includes the establishment of a risk framework and risk appetite statement approved annually by the enterprise risk committee and the board. Our operational risk management program addresses the overarching processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling operational risk, and reporting operational risk information to management and the board. We utilize various risk mitigation techniques, including the use of technology to enhance our operational capabilities and improve our ability to manage risks. Our technology infrastructure supports our business processes and is critical for maintaining operational efficiency. We also engage in asset securitization transactions to fund consumer lending activities, which requires effective management of our technology resources and capabilities. The integration of technology into our operations enhances our ability to respond to changing market dynamics and consumer demands. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan, and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks, which include the effective deployment of IT capabilities to support business needs. We monitor our liquidity position and review the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility. Our risk management framework is dependent on ensuring that a sound risk culture exists throughout the corporation, and we manage risks associated with third parties and vendors. The effectiveness of our IT governance is crucial for ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and we continuously assess our technology capabilities to enhance our operational resilience and support our business innovation initiatives. The management of our technology portfolio is integral to our overall strategy and operational effectiveness, allowing us to leverage IT capabilities to achieve competitive advantage and improve firm performance.

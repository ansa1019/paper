The company relies on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data. These systems support a variety of critical business processes and activities. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, these information technology systems could adversely affect the business, reputation, and financial statements. The company has been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, and other cyber-attacks, which are expected to continue increasing in sophistication and frequency. The ability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements is crucial to prevent data breaches and regulatory consequences. The company’s operations are also affected by worldwide, regional, and industry-specific economic and political factors, including rapid technological development, particularly with respect to computing, mobile connectivity, communications, and digitization. The company is making significant investments, both organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development, and customer-facing resources. The company’s growth and profitability depend on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and segments, identify and integrate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. The company’s strategic resource allocation includes investments in technology management, which are essential for maintaining operational efficiency and enhancing business processes. The company’s reliance on collaborative relationships with third parties for development, supply, and marketing of products and potential products is critical, as these partnerships can significantly impact the success of product development and commercialization. The company’s ability to innovate and develop new technologies and applications, as well as to acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies, is vital for maintaining a competitive advantage in rapidly changing markets. The company also faces risks associated with compliance with various regulations, including those governing data privacy and security, which can impact its operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The company’s financial performance is sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be influenced by technological innovations and the introduction of new products and services. The company’s success will depend on its ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences, allocate research and development funding effectively, and stimulate customer demand for new technologies. The integration of acquired businesses and the realization of anticipated synergies through the application of the company’s business system are also critical for enhancing its information technology capabilities and overall organizational effectiveness.

Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations are subject to numerous factors, including changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers' spending plans. The ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments is critical, as price and product competition in the communications and networking industries can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models. The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers is also a significant factor. The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, as well as our success in new and evolving markets, including in our newer product categories such as data center and collaboration, are essential for maintaining competitive advantage. Our ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans, and the impact of changes in our business model, could result in significant restructuring charges. We have been investing in key growth areas and expect to continue to do so, particularly in data center virtualization, software, security, and cloud, while also focusing on maintaining leadership in routing, switching, and services. However, the return on these investments may be lower or develop more slowly than expected. Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, particularly in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment. The timing of large orders can significantly affect our business and operating results from quarter to quarter. We have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times, which have caused some customers to place duplicate orders or to cancel orders upon receipt of the product. Inventory management remains an area of focus, as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component shortages in the past, which have affected our operations. We may experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of manufacturing issues or strong demand in the industry for those parts. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. Many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multiple-party, collaborative interaction would demand. Our architectural approach is designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and IT. The process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends, our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in market-accepted products. The growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market, and the success of new products depends on several factors, including proper new product definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation from competitors, and market acceptance.

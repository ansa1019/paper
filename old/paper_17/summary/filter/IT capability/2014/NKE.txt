Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including its supply chain and retail operations, with any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology potentially harming its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. The reliability of these information technology systems is crucial for effectively managing and maintaining inventory and shipping products to customers on a timely basis. Nike has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions where it operates, and ongoing work to integrate and enhance these systems and related processes is essential. The failure of these systems to operate effectively or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced operational efficiency, requiring significant capital investments to remediate issues and potentially adversely affecting results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, the company engages in electronic communications globally among employees and with third parties, including customers and suppliers, making its information technology systems critical to many operating activities and business processes. Disruptions or shutdowns of these systems could negatively impact Nike's operations, leading to delays in reporting financial results and resulting in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Nike's commitment to product innovation and quality is supported by substantial investments in digital capabilities and infrastructure, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly changing market environment. The company’s operational strategies include leveraging information technology to enhance business processes, improve operational efficiency, and drive growth through innovative product offerings and deep consumer connections. The integration of advanced information technology capabilities is also aimed at optimizing supply chain management and enhancing customer relationships, which are vital for sustaining market agility and responsiveness to consumer demands. Additionally, Nike’s digital transformation initiatives are focused on enhancing its information management capabilities, ensuring data security, and improving the accuracy and timeliness of information processing, which are critical for informed decision-making and strategic resource allocation. The company acknowledges that challenges in managing its increasingly complex information systems and controls, including those related to demand and supply planning and inventory control, could pose risks to its operational effectiveness and overall business performance.

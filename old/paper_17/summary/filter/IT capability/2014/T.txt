The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs; our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies (e.g., cable, wireless and VoIP) and our ability to maintain capital expenditures; the extent of competition and the resulting pressure on customer and access line totals and wireline and wireless operating margins; our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition in our wireless and wireline markets; the ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to lower cost structures and regulatory and legislative actions adverse to us; changes in our corporate strategies, such as changing network requirements or acquisitions and dispositions, which may require significant amounts of cash or stock, to respond to competition and regulatory, legislative and technological developments; our ability to manage growth in wireless data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms; our ability to adequately fund our wireless operations, including payment for additional spectrum, network upgrades and technological advancements; and the impact on our networks and business from major equipment failures; security breaches related to the network or customer information; our inability to obtain handsets, equipment/software or have handsets, equipment/software serviced in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers; or severe weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, energy shortages, wars or terrorist attacks. These factors highlight the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions may result in a significant reduction in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general and on our products and services specifically, due to this fiscal uncertainty. The final outcome of FCC and other federal or state agency proceedings involving issues that are important to our business, including the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, competition policy, and broadband deployment, will also influence our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. Our ability to attract and offer a diverse portfolio of wireless service and device financing plans, devices and maintain margins is critical in the context of evolving market dynamics and competitive positioning. The continued development of attractive and profitable service offerings and the availability, cost and/or reliability of the various technologies and/or content required to provide such offerings are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. The outcome of pending, threatened or potential litigation, including patent and product safety claims by or against third parties, may also impact our operational efficiency and strategic management practices. Overall, these elements underscore the significance of IT capability in supporting business needs and enhancing organizational performance in a rapidly changing business environment.

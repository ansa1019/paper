In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including those related to technology and operational systems. Our operational and security systems, infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, are integral to our performance. We rely on digital technologies, computer, database and email systems, software, and networks to conduct our operations. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and as a result of our interactions with third parties, which may expose us to risk. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years, driven by the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication of organized crime and hackers. Our businesses rely on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks. We continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth, which entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. 

The corporation's risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, focusing on identifying, measuring, monitoring, reporting, and controlling exposure to various risks, including operational risk. Our risk management processes are integrated into key strategic, capital, and financial planning processes, ensuring that risks are appropriately considered and evaluated. We employ a risk management process referred to as immc: identify, measure, monitor, and control, which is fundamental to our operations. The board and its committees oversee compliance with safe and sound banking practices, while executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business. 

Our liquidity risk management activities are centralized within corporate treasury, enhancing our ability to monitor liquidity requirements and access diverse funding sources. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets that can be used to meet our funding requirements. The corporation's liquidity policy is approved by the board, and the enterprise risk committee (erc) approves the contingency funding plan, establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. 

We utilize various models to assess and control our market risk exposures, which are subject to inherent limitations. Our models rely on historical trends and assumptions, which may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns or extreme market movements. The risk management framework includes delegations of authority whereby the board and its committees oversee compliance with risk management activities. 

In addition, we have developed and maintain contingency plans designed to prepare us for potential adverse outcomes and scenarios. These plans include capital contingency planning, liquidity contingency funding plans, and recovery planning. We conduct corporation-wide stress tests to understand balance sheet, earnings, capital, and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios. Our risk management practices are continuously reviewed and enhanced to ensure they remain effective in mitigating risks associated with our operations and technology capabilities.

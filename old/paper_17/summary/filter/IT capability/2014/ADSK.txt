We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks, including the impact of global economic and political conditions on our business, financial results, and financial condition. As our business has expanded globally, we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in these conditions, which may cause customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in reductions in sales of our products and services. The transition from personal computer to cloud, social, and mobile computing has accelerated our move to the cloud, requiring considerable investment of technical, financial, legal, and sales resources. Our ability to achieve financial objectives is subject to risks such as market acceptance of new offerings, security, reliability, performance, and customer concerns regarding data management. We are focused on providing solutions that enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative, which is essential for meeting evolving customer requirements. Our strategy includes improving product functionality and expanding offerings through internal development and acquisitions, which may involve integration challenges and impact operating margins. We continually invest in our information technology systems to support business strategies and work processes, and any failure in these investments could disrupt operations and harm financial performance. The complexity of our software products necessitates extensive testing and quality control, and any errors could damage our reputation and lead to loss of revenue. Our business model transition to cloud-based products and flexible licensing is designed to enhance operational efficiency and customer value, although it presents uncertainties regarding customer demand and acceptance. We rely on a network of distributors and resellers for a significant portion of our revenue, and any financial instability within this channel could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. Our financial results are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which we manage through derivative instruments. We are committed to maintaining strong relationships with our distribution channels, as their financial health is critical to our revenue generation. The success of our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services is contingent upon our ability to effectively manage technological changes and customer preferences. Our investments in technology and product development are aimed at enhancing our competitive advantage and addressing complex challenges faced by our customers. We also recognize the importance of maintaining robust information management capabilities to ensure data accuracy, reliability, and security. Our ongoing efforts to enhance our IT capabilities are integral to achieving operational flexibility and supporting strategic resource allocation, which are essential for sustaining business performance in a competitive landscape.

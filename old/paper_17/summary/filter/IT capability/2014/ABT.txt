Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's results of operations. The size and complexity of Abbott's information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a significant effect on Abbott's business. In addition, Abbott's management has recognized the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support and enhance business strategies and work processes. The company has also engaged in significant investments in information technology, which are critical for operational efficiency and the coordination of its assets and internal processes. Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline. To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies, committing substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. The company’s ability to effectively support business needs through its IT capabilities has become key in transforming Abbott into a competitive force. The research and development process focuses on the geographic expansion and continuous improvement of the segment's existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. Abbott's strategic management practices involve evaluating and optimizing its technology portfolio to ensure alignment with business strategies and market demands. The integration of technology capabilities into Abbott's operations is essential for enhancing organizational effectiveness and achieving performance gains. Additionally, Abbott's transitional services agreements with AbbVie include certain information technology and back office support, which are designed to enable AbbVie to establish its stand-alone processes. The ongoing management of Abbott's IT systems is crucial for maintaining information reliability, security, and compliance with regulatory requirements. The company’s commitment to improving its IT infrastructure is reflected in its capital expenditures, which include investments in information technology and laboratory instruments placed with customers. Overall, Abbott's IT capabilities are integral to its operational flexibility, market agility, and ability to respond to competitive actions and external influences, thereby supporting its long-term business objectives and performance outcomes.

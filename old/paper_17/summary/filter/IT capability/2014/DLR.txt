Digital Realty Trust, Inc.'s portfolio consists primarily of technology-related real estate, particularly datacenter real estate. A decrease in the demand for datacenter space, internet gateway facilities, or other technology-related real estate would have a greater adverse effect on the business and financial condition than if the portfolio were more diversified. The company is particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns and adverse developments in the corporate datacenter, internet, and data communications industries, which could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or reduced demand for datacenter space. Changes in industry practice or technology, such as virtualization or more efficient computing devices, could also reduce demand for physical datacenter space. The development of new technologies and the adoption of new industry standards could render many tenants' current products and services obsolete, increasing the likelihood of tenant defaults. Digital Realty Trust, Inc. focuses on investing in and developing technology-related real estate, believing that growth in corporate datacenter adoption will continue to be superior to that of the overall economy. The company targets high-quality, strategically located properties that contain applications and operations critical to the day-to-day operations of corporate enterprise datacenter and technology industry tenants. The properties are equipped with fully redundant electrical supply systems, multiple power feeds, above-standard cooling systems, and high-level security systems. The company has developed detailed procedures for evaluating new real estate investments to ensure they meet financial and technical criteria. The ability to grow earnings depends in part on the ability to develop space and lease development space at favorable rates, which may not be obtainable. The company expects to incur significant tenant improvement costs to build out and develop turn-key flex® space, which is move-in-ready space for datacenter environments. As of December 31, 2014, the company had approximately 1.3 million square feet of space under active development and approximately 1.2 million square feet held for future development. The company’s growth strategy includes acquiring additional technology-related real estate and managing and leasing assets to increase cash flow. The demand for datacenter space continues to exceed supply in many markets, particularly in Dallas, Northern Virginia, and Dublin, although the Silicon Valley market may face significant over-supply risks. The company’s substantial development activities make it particularly vulnerable to economic downturns and other adverse developments in technology industries. The ability to attract and retain tenants is influenced by the availability of telecommunications carriers' fiber networks serving the locations of the datacenters, as well as the company's reliance on third parties for internet connectivity. Any delays or disruptions in connectivity may adversely affect operating results and cash flow. The company also faces risks related to the management of its growth, including the need for significant capital investment in technology infrastructure and the potential for increased operating expenses due to higher utility rates. The company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet customer needs depend on the reliability of its technology systems and infrastructure. The company’s strategic management practices include evaluating market conditions, tenant demand, and the competitive landscape to optimize resource allocation and enhance firm capabilities.

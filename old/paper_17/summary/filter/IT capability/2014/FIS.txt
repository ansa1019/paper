We are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those related to constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new services, and evolving industry standards. Our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to enhance our current services and develop new services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers. The markets for our services are characterized by intense competition, and we face direct competition from third parties, as many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key applications in-house. The migration by many financial institutions to outsourced integrated technology solutions is a trend from which we are benefiting, as it helps improve profitability and rapidly address regulatory challenges. Our integrated solutions and outsourced services are positioned to address this outsourcing trend across the markets we serve. We believe that our consulting services, particularly in risk and compliance, are increasingly in demand as financial institutions seek to transform their businesses to reduce costs, innovate, and comply with increased regulatory oversight regarding information technology and related processes. Our clients are increasingly seeking to provide a single integrated banking experience through their branch, mobile, internet, and voice banking channels, and we are focused on enabling them to deliver this experience through our integrated solutions. We are also investing in our card management solutions to accommodate the transition to EMV integrated circuit cards, which is anticipated to accelerate. High-profile security breaches in the payment card industry have pushed the industry towards improved information security measures, and we are making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems. Our operations are regularly examined by federal and state regulatory authorities, and we are required to comply with numerous regulations that could impact our business practices and the demand for our software and services. The Dodd-Frank Act and associated regulations may require us to modify our products and services to facilitate compliance for our clients, which could necessitate additional capital investments. Our ability to attract and retain skilled technical employees is critical to our growth, as the development of our products and services requires proficiency in various disciplines. The competition for such technical personnel is intense, and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could adversely affect our ability to satisfy client demand. We are also subject to risks associated with our technology solutions, including potential defects, development delays, and service disruptions, which could harm our business and reputation. Our technology infrastructure is essential for the verification of transactions and the detection or prevention of fraudulent payments, and any compromise could result in significant financial loss. We continue to monitor our information security and risk management programs to address emerging threats and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. As we expand our international operations, we face additional risks associated with economic volatility and regulatory compliance in emerging markets, which could impact our revenue and growth.

BlackRock's infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock's business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock's control, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth. BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cyber security policies, procedures, and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. A failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies could disrupt operations and cause financial losses. The sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via the Aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and business relationships are a key element to BlackRock's competitive success. BlackRock relies on its ability, as well as the ability of a number of third parties who provide it with various types of data and software, to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. The company has invested significantly in technology to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures. BlackRock's management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of assets under management. The company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients or employees, and has procedures and controls in place designed to detect and address these issues. BlackRock's ability to develop, market, and manage new investment products and services requires continued innovative efforts and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. The development and introduction of new products and services may expose BlackRock to additional costs or operational risk. The company's Aladdin operating platform serves as the investment/risk solutions system for BlackRock and other institutional investors. BlackRock builds upon its leadership position to meet the growing need for investment and risk management solutions. The company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions from acting as a broker-dealer in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. BlackRock's ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors is material to the company's future performance. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully, it may experience an increase in distribution-related costs, which could cause a decline in assets under management, revenue, and earnings. BlackRock's success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the company's ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers, and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock's ability to attract and retain such employees include the company's reputation, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession.

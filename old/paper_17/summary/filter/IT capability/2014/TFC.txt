BB&T's business has become more dynamic and complex in recent years, necessitating annual evaluations and adjustments to the company's business strategy in response to the current operating environment. The achievement of BB&T's key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges, including the cost and risk associated with regulatory reform and initiatives, as well as IT projects. The ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and its related rulemaking activities may result in lower revenues, higher costs, and ratings downgrades. BB&T's management considers the current financial condition and performance of the company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective. The company faces intense competition within the financial services industry, which may reduce its customer base or cause it to lower prices for its products and services in order to maintain market share. Additionally, there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices, which can reduce BB&T's net interest margin and revenues from fee-based products and services. The adoption of new technologies by competitors, including internet banking services and mobile applications, could require BB&T to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its existing products and services. BB&T's success depends, in part, on its ability to adapt its products and services to evolving industry standards and customer expectations. The company is investing significant resources in an enterprise-wide initiative aimed at implementing an integrated ERP financial platform, utilizing certain modules of SAP software, with the objective of modernizing and consolidating many existing systems used for various functions throughout the company. This initiative is critical for providing timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. BB&T's computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, which may adversely affect the company's business or reputation. The company has established a risk management framework that includes oversight and guidance of risk-taking across the enterprise, ensuring effective risk management oversight, measurement, monitoring, and reporting. BB&T's effective risk management framework enables it to achieve superior performance relative to peers and ensures that the company is viewed among the safest of banks. The company relies on its employees, systems, and certain counterparties, and any failures could materially adversely affect operations. BB&T's business is dependent on the ability to process, record, and monitor a large number of complex transactions, and management must ensure that risks are managed effectively to maintain operational efficiency. The integration of acquired businesses and the implementation of new systems are essential for achieving cost savings and operational synergies. BB&T's management regularly monitors the capital position of the company and ensures that sufficient capital is available to maintain and grow core business operations in a safe and sound manner. The company also utilizes various technologies to manage market risk associated with asset and liability portfolios, focusing on strategic pricing and management of appropriate maturity mixes of assets and liabilities.

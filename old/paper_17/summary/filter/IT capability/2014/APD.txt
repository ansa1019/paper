The company depends on information technology to enable efficient operations and interface with customers, maintaining financial accuracy and efficiency. Information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and outsourced service providers. The allocation and effective management of resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure are critical; failure to do so could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions, or loss of confidential business information through security breaches. The company's information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. The security of these systems is vital, as unauthorized access could disrupt business operations and have a material adverse effect on financial condition or results of operations. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new requirements. The company has established policies and procedures to protect the security and privacy of information, including customer data and technical information. Breaches of security measures or accidental loss of proprietary information could expose the company to risks of loss or misuse, litigation, and potential liability, damaging its reputation and business. The company recognizes that its IT capabilities must evolve to encompass coordination of assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. The importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities is underscored. The firm's IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding, to further organizational goals. The company's ability to manage ongoing organizational change, including transitioning and stabilizing key business and functional processes, is critical to business success. The company is actively investing significant capital and other resources in emerging markets, which presents special risks, including unfamiliar regulatory environments and the need to tailor products for acceptance by local markets. The firm's operational flexibility and the ability to manage risks inherent in operating in developing markets are essential for success. The company faces strong competition, and the introduction of new technologies or competing products could weaken demand for its offerings. The ability to recover unanticipated increased energy and raw material costs from customers is also a concern. The company's operational results depend on maintaining its production facilities and meeting customer requirements, which is influenced by the effectiveness of its technology infrastructure and management practices. The firm must navigate various external influences, including economic conditions, regulatory changes, and competitive actions, which could impact its performance and strategic objectives.

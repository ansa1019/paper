Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including technological changes and events, which may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. The availability and cost of capital, as well as market fluctuations, can significantly impact our ability to achieve strategic objectives. The profitability of our products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, which are influenced by market conditions and client activity. We believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of many of our businesses, and poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings. Our financial performance is also affected by the ability to offer appropriate product alternatives that encourage customers to continue purchasing in the face of market volatility. 

Our businesses operate in intensely competitive industry segments, and we compete based on factors including service quality, investment performance, and perceived financial strength. The operational systems and networks we rely on are subject to evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client information and damage to our reputation. Maintaining the integrity of these systems is critical to our business operations, including the retention of our advisors and clients. We routinely encounter and address cybersecurity threats, and while we have not experienced material breaches, any future incidents could have a material adverse impact on our business.

We invest in and develop capabilities and tools designed to maximize advisor productivity and client satisfaction, which are essential for addressing the evolving financial and retirement-related needs of our clients. Our asset management capabilities are increasingly global in scale, and we aim to leverage existing strengths to effectively expand into new global and emerging markets. Our underlying asset management philosophy is based on delivering consistently strong and competitive investment performance, which is demonstrated by the ratings of our mutual funds.

The success of our strategies may be affected by various factors, including changes in the regulatory framework of the financial services industry, the ability to pursue and complete strategic transactions, and the effectiveness of our risk management policies and procedures. We have devoted significant resources to develop these policies and will continue to do so, although they may not be fully effective in mitigating risk exposure in all market environments. 

Our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and cash generated by operations, and we maintain substantial liquidity to fund our operating expenses. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, and availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to meet our operating liquidity needs. The payment of dividends by our subsidiaries is restricted and subject to regulatory capital requirements, which could impact our ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. 

In summary, our ability to manage and leverage IT capabilities is crucial for supporting business strategies, enhancing operational efficiency, and maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly changing market environment.

Our business performance during fiscal 2014 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery, which has implications for our IT capabilities as we continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses, and government entities, underscoring the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. Continued investments in infrastructure, technology, and network processing support our global growth initiatives, reflecting our commitment to operational efficiency and the enhancement of our IT capabilities. The evolution of technology and the opening of new market segments require us to invest in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Our ability to adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, or resistance to change from clients or merchants. We recognize that rapid, significant technological changes confront the payments industry, including developments in smart cards, e-commerce, mobile, and proximity payment devices. Our transaction processing systems are central to our operations, and any disruptions could materially affect our revenues and operating results. We rely on service providers for the timely transmission of information across our global data network, and any failure to provide the necessary communications capacity could interrupt our services. We are also subject to privacy and data protection regulations, which could increase compliance costs and impact our operational flexibility. Our strategic resource allocation is influenced by competitive pressures, and we may need to increase incentives to clients to maintain transaction volumes. The Dodd-Frank Act has increased competitive pressure and may limit our ability to establish optimal pricing structures, which could adversely affect our financial condition and overall business. As we engage in discussions with merchants, acquirers, and processors, our success increasingly depends on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. The competitive landscape is evolving, with potential competitors developing products that could impair or replace the value-added services we provide. Our IT capabilities must adapt to these changes to ensure we remain a competitive force in the market. The integration of technology into our operations is essential for maintaining our market positioning and ensuring that we can respond effectively to regulatory changes and market dynamics. Our financial institution clients depend on our capabilities to support their operations, and any failure to deliver adequate services could impair our business and reputation. We continue to enhance our IT governance and management practices to ensure that we can effectively manage the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapidly changing payments landscape.

Our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. Slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, other austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of reducing demand for our products and services, limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies. We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation. If we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences, allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects, anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and services and technological innovations, differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid commoditization, innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets. We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in our served markets and to globalize our manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of our operations. Our restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. These systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.

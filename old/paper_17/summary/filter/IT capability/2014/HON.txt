Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in highly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, develop and maintain competitive products, enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, develop, manufacture and bring new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers' needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies, and the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions. Our consolidated operating results are principally impacted by changes in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets, overall sales mix, the extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation, and the impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense. Our 2015 areas of focus are supported by the Honeywell enablers, including the Honeywell operating system, velocity product development, functional transformation, and the Honeywell user experience. These areas of focus include driving profitable growth through R&D, technological excellence, and optimized manufacturing capability to deliver innovative products that customers value, expanding margins by maintaining and improving the company's cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, and driving strong cash flow conversion through effective working capital management which will enable the company to undertake strategic actions to benefit the business.

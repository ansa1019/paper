If overall demand for IBM's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility, and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, agile processes, and changes to the way the company works, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings, and investments through the company's globally integrated model. These initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity, and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. IBM has been moving into areas that incorporate or utilize artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, quantum, and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through innovation. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and profit margins. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles, and regulations governing intellectual property. The company's products, services, and systems may be used in critical operations, involving the storage, processing, and transmission of sensitive data. Successful cybersecurity attacks could result in unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of data or systems, potentially exposing the company to liability and regulatory action. The evolving cybersecurity landscape may necessitate significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. The company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk, though such measures cannot eliminate the risk entirely. The regulatory environment regarding cybersecurity and data protection is increasingly complex and may have impacts on the company's business, including increased risk, costs, and expanded compliance obligations. The potential impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and regulations on the company's business and reputation may grow as the company's focus on data increases. The company's financial results are affected by factors such as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively, and the nature of its customers' businesses. The company is a globally integrated entity, and changes in laws or policies could affect its business and overall results. The company may incur substantial costs for environmental matters and is subject to various laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. The company's financial performance could be impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions and customer credit risk on receivables. The company relies on third-party distribution channels and ecosystems, and changes in the business condition of these partners could affect its ability to bring products to market. The company has made acquisitions and alliances, which present significant challenges and risks, including the failure to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements. The company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements due to inherent limitations. The company's future success depends on the availability and integrity of skilled employees, and competition for their talents is intense. The company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers, and the failure of suppliers to deliver components could adversely affect the company's business.

The company has implemented measures to enhance and modernize its systems to guard against similar attacks in the future and is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to enhance the company's resiliency against future cyber-attacks. The objective of these efforts is not only to protect against future cyber-attacks but also to improve the speed of the company's recovery from such attacks and enable continued business operations to the greatest extent possible during any recovery period. The company monitors its data, information technology, and personnel usage of company IT systems to reduce these risks on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats.

The company continues to evaluate its technology portfolio to ensure alignment with business strategies and market needs, emphasizing the importance of IT capability in transforming the firm into a competitive force.

JPMorgan Chase's businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of its financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing, and other operational systems to process, record, monitor, and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly, and securely. The effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase's operational systems depends on the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated, or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's operations depend on the competence and integrity of its employees and those of external parties, including vendors, custodians, and financial markets infrastructures. The ineffectiveness, failure, or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including delays or other disruptions in providing information, services, and liquidity to clients and customers. Additionally, the introduction of new products, services, or delivery platforms may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, potentially leading to higher litigation costs, regulatory fines, penalties, and other sanctions. 

JPMorgan Chase's businesses are also subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which could require it to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure to comply with various laws and regulations. The regulation of financial services is extensive and comprehensive, and existing and new laws and regulations could require JPMorgan Chase to limit the products and services that it offers or incur higher costs for compliance. The firm faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations, which may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. 

Furthermore, the competitive environment in the financial services industry is intense, with competition from other banks, trading firms, and technology companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, necessitating that JPMorgan Chase adapt its offerings to retain clients and customers. The firm must also manage operational risks associated with third-party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions or shared services. 

Lastly, the ability to effectively manage liquidity is critical to JPMorgan Chase's ability to fund and operate its businesses. The firmâ€™s liquidity could be impaired by market-wide illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements, or default by a significant market participant. A diminution of JPMorgan Chase's liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control, which could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and adversely affect its results of operations.

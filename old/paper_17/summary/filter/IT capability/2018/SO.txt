The traditional electric operating companies and southern company gas are subject to substantial state and federal governmental regulation. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements may result in substantial costs. The traditional electric operating companies seek to recover their costs through retail rates, which must be approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Retaining market-based rate authority is important to remain competitive in the wholesale electric markets. The impact of any future revision or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws may result in substantial costs or negatively affect results of operations. The southern company system's costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and involve capital and operating costs. The epa has adopted regulations governing air and water quality under the clean air act and the clean water act, which may require the southern company system to incur substantial costs. The traditional electric operating companies and southern company gas are engaged in continuous construction programs to accommodate existing and estimated future loads. These construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary due to numerous factors, including changes in business conditions and environmental laws. The southern company system intends to continue its strategy of developing and constructing new electric generating facilities and improving transmission and distribution systems. The ability to control costs and avoid overruns is subject to various factors, including labor productivity and management of contractors. The southern company system's construction program is currently estimated to total approximately $8.0 billion for 2019, which includes capital expenditures related to environmental compliance. The southern company system's commitment to environmental compliance has resulted in significant investments in environmental capital retrofit projects. The southern company system has also established an intermediate goal of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions from 2007 levels by 2030 and a long-term goal of low- to no-carbon operations by 2050. Achieving these goals will depend on various external factors, including supportive national energy policies and the development of relevant energy technologies. The financial performance of southern company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if they are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform corporate functions. The financial performance depends on the successful operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Information technology system failures and compliance with mandatory reliability standards, including cyber security standards, pose operational risks. The southern company system operates in highly regulated industries that require the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Increased connectivity to the internet and the critical nature of the infrastructure heighten the risk of cyberattacks. The registrants face ongoing threats to their assets, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems and confidential data. Despite robust security measures, assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized access due to human error, technological failure, or attacks. Any cyber breach or theft of sensitive electronic data may subject the registrants to penalties and claims from regulators or other third parties. The ultimate impact of these matters cannot be determined at this time but could have a significant effect on the financial condition and results of operations.
On September 6, 2018, the FERC issued an order establishing a refund effective date of May 10, 2018, in the event a refund is due and initiating an investigation and settlement procedures regarding the current base ROE. Through December 31, 2018, the estimated maximum potential refund is not expected to be material to Georgia Power's results of operations or cash flows. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. Georgia Power's revenues from regulated retail operations are collected through various rate mechanisms subject to the oversight of the Georgia PSC. Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2013 ARP, which includes traditional base tariff rates, demand-side management (DSM) tariffs, ECCR tariffs, and municipal franchise fee (MFF) tariffs. Georgia Power is scheduled to file a base rate case by July 1, 2019, which may continue or modify these tariffs. Furthermore, through December 31, 2019, Georgia Power will retain its merger savings, net of transition costs, as defined in the settlement agreement; through December 31, 2022, such net merger savings will be shared on a 60/40 basis with customers; thereafter, all merger savings will be retained by customers. There were no changes to Georgia Power's traditional base tariff rates, ECCR tariff, DSM tariffs, or MFF tariff in 2017 or 2018. Under the 2013 ARP, Georgia Power's retail ROE is set at 10.95%, and earnings are evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.00% to 12.00%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.00% will be directly refunded to customers, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. There will be no recovery of any earnings shortfall below 10.00% on an actual basis. In 2016, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power refunded to retail customers in 2018 approximately $40 million as approved by the Georgia PSC. On February 5, 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a settlement between Georgia Power and the staff of the Georgia PSC under which Georgia Power's retail ROE for 2017 was stipulated to exceed 12.00%, and Georgia Power will reduce certain regulatory assets by approximately $4 million in lieu of providing refunds to retail customers. In 2018, Georgia Power's retail ROE exceeded 12.00%, and Georgia Power accrued approximately $100 million to refund to retail customers, subject to review and approval by the Georgia PSC. On April 3, 2018, the Georgia PSC approved the Georgia Power tax reform settlement agreement. Pursuant to the Georgia Power tax reform settlement agreement, to reflect the federal income tax rate reduction impact of the tax reform legislation, Georgia Power will refund to customers a total of $330 million through bill credits. Georgia Power issued bill credits of approximately $130 million in 2018 and will issue bill credits of approximately $95 million in June 2019 and $105 million in February 2020. Additionally, Georgia Power is deferring as a regulatory liability the revenue equivalent of the tax expense reduction resulting from legislation lowering the Georgia state income tax rate from 6.00% to 5.75% in 2019 and the entire benefit of federal and state excess accumulated deferred income taxes, which is expected to total approximately $700 million at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2018, the related regulatory liability balance totaled $610 million. The amortization of these regulatory liabilities is expected to be addressed in the Georgia Power 2019 base rate case. If there is not a base rate case in 2019, customers will receive $185 million in annual bill credits beginning in 2020, with any additional federal and state income tax savings deferred as a regulatory liability until Georgia Power's next base rate case.

ExxonMobil's financial and operating results are subject to various risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses, including technological improvements in energy efficiency and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices. The company's ability to maintain and grow its oil and gas production depends on the success of its exploration and development efforts, which require continuous improvement in identifying promising resource prospects and applying project management expertise. The long-term success of ExxonMobil's upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects that necessitate a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. An important component of ExxonMobil's competitive performance is its operational efficiency, which includes managing expenses and improving production yields through technology improvements, cost control, and productivity enhancements. To maintain its competitive position, ExxonMobil's research and development organizations must adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The company must continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies to remain competitive. Additionally, ExxonMobil's results depend on effective management systems and continuous focus on workplace safety and minimizing environmental risks. The company applies rigorous management systems and maintains a disciplined framework of internal controls for monitoring compliance. Cybersecurity is a significant concern, with ExxonMobil regularly subject to attempted disruptions from various threat actors. The company's defensive preparedness includes multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions, along with non-technological measures such as threat information sharing and internal training. If cybersecurity measures prove insufficient, the company could face significant costs and operational disruptions. ExxonMobil's ability to mitigate adverse impacts from severe weather events, natural disasters, and human error is also crucial, as its facilities are designed to withstand extreme conditions. The company faces competition not only from private firms but also from state-owned companies that may pursue opportunities with less focus on financial returns. Technology and expertise provided by industry service companies may enhance the competitiveness of firms that lack the internal resources of ExxonMobil. The company's reputation is a vital corporate asset, and adverse events such as significant cybersecurity disruptions could negatively impact its ability to compete for new opportunities and obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Overall, ExxonMobil's future business results depend on managing both external factors and those within its control, including effective project management, operational efficiency, and the successful adaptation to technological changes and market dynamics.

In addition, we rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining data in a secure manner are critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control, such actions may not be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. We have made significant investments in technology to enhance our operational efficiency and support our strategic objectives. Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products, which is dependent on our ability to develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and end-user customers. The success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers' needs. Our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations. We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing. We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price. The rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results. Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted. We must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and end-user customers, which is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships. The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, and lower consumer spending. We believe that our IT capabilities, including our ability to manage and analyze big data, are essential for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. Our IT architecture must support the integration of various technology resources to enhance our operational flexibility and improve decision-making speed. The ability to leverage our IT capabilities effectively is crucial for optimizing our business processes and achieving our organizational goals. We continuously assess our technology portfolio to ensure alignment with our strategic objectives and to capitalize on emerging investment opportunities.

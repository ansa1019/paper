The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs; our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies or delivery methods; the extent of competition including from governmental networks and other providers and the resulting pressure on customer totals and segment operating margins; our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition and increasing fragmentation of customer viewing habits; the ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to lower cost structures and regulatory and legislative actions adverse to us; the continued development and delivery of attractive and profitable video and broadband offerings; our ability to match speeds offered by our competitors and the availability, cost and/or reliability of the various technologies and/or content required to provide such offerings; our ability to manage growth in wireless data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms; and the impact from major equipment failures on our networks, including satellites operated by directv; the effect of security breaches related to the network or customer information; our inability to obtain handsets, equipment/software or have handsets, equipment/software serviced in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers. Our ability to take advantage of the desire of advertisers to change traditional video advertising models and our increased exposure to foreign economies, including foreign exchange fluctuations as well as regulatory and political uncertainty, are also critical. Changes in our corporate strategies, such as changing network-related requirements or acquisitions and dispositions, may require significant amounts of cash or stock to respond to competition and regulatory, legislative and technological developments. The uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions may result in a significant decrease in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general. The final outcome of FCC and other federal, state or foreign government agency proceedings involving issues that are important to our business, including the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, could impact our operational capabilities and market positioning. Additionally, the enactment of additional state, local, federal and/or foreign regulatory and tax laws and regulations, or changes to existing standards, could reduce our incentive to invest in our networks, resulting in lower revenue growth and/or higher operating costs. Our ability to maintain margins, attract and offer a diverse portfolio of video, wireless service and devices, and device financing plans is essential for sustaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market landscape. The complexity and rapid evolution of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding intellectual property rights protection and privacy could result in increased costs or claims against us that may harm our reputation. Overall, the interplay of technological advancements, competitive dynamics, regulatory changes, and market demands will significantly influence our operational effectiveness and strategic resource allocation moving forward.

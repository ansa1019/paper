Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including intense competition and the need to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users. Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant, and useful products, services, and technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services, necessitating significant investments in research and development to enhance our technology and existing products. The internet is accessed through a variety of platforms and form factors that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt our search technology or products developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected. Our products and services depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, which are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from various threats. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain state-of-the-art security protections that shield against bugs, theft, misuse, or security vulnerabilities or breaches. Our ongoing investment in new businesses and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our current operations. We face risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management that could affect our ability to supply both our products and our internet-based services. We rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products and may experience supply shortages and price increases driven by various factors, including raw material availability and labor shortages. Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, and partners. We continue to make significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning, and search. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Our ability to attract and retain users and customers to our products and services is critical, as is our ability to monetize traffic on Google properties and our Google network members' properties. We must continue to invest in our technology infrastructure to support our growth and respond to changing market dynamics. The creation of Alphabet as a holding company reflects our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users. Our strategic transactions, including acquisitions, are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people's everyday lives. We are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny and changes in public policies that may negatively affect our business. Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition, including evolving foreign laws and legal systems. We rely on highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.

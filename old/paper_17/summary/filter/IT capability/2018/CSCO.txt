Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations are subject to numerous factors, including changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers' spending plans. The ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers, and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures is critical, especially during periods of global credit market disruption. Our strategy and operating plans' execution and the impact of changes in our business model could result in significant restructuring charges. We expect to invest in key priority and growth areas, including security and applications, while maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and services. The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings is essential, as revenue is recognized over time. Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions and the benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales, service, and marketing are crucial. Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including the introduction of new products and business models, could affect our gross margins. The overall movement toward industry consolidation among competitors and customers may impact our market dynamics. Our investments in engineering and technology are designed to enable increased use of the network as a platform for automating, orchestrating, integrating, and delivering IT-based products and services. The complexity of developing new technology, including intent-based networking and programmable networks, presents challenges. Our strategic priorities include accelerating innovation, increasing the value of the network, and transforming our business model to meet evolving customer needs. We face competition from numerous vendors in each product category, and the overall competitive landscape is characterized by rapid change and technological convergence. Our ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services, introduce new products, and reduce production costs will be critical to maintaining competitive advantage. The markets in which we operate are intensely competitive, and we must manage complex relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners. Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is influenced by various factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions and the timing of revenue recognition. Our ability to meet financial expectations could be adversely affected by nonlinear sales patterns and manufacturing issues that delay shipments. The growth of our business depends on the continued evolution of the internet and the deployment of our products by customers who rely on this growth. We must navigate uncertainties related to regulation of the internet and telecommunications, which could adversely affect our business. Our success relies heavily on our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel, as competition for these resources is intense. Additionally, we are exposed to risks associated with the use of intellectual property, and our ability to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions is vital for our growth. We are committed to investing in our key priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term, while also managing the risks associated with market dynamics and technological advancements.

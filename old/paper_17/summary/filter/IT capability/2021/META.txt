Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service. Our ability to compete effectively is influenced by our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including the ability to attract, engage, and retain users, which is critical to our success. Our financial performance has been significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions. The effectiveness of our advertising revenue is dependent on our ability to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, which is influenced by our IT systems and capabilities. Our advertising revenue growth has been adversely affected by reduced marketer spending due to limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the iOS operating system. We anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by these limitations and other changes in the regulatory environment. Our business and results of operations have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. The pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, which has increased demand for our advertising services. However, we have also experienced fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in certain markets, particularly where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User engagement is impacted by competitive products and services, and we have introduced new features to respond to these competitive pressures. Our investments in data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities are expected to drive expense growth, which may exceed our revenue growth rates. Our ability to maintain and enhance our brands is critical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers, and maintaining user trust is essential for user engagement. We are subject to various laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, and data protection, which may require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on our platforms, and we recognize revenue based on the number of impressions delivered or actions taken by users. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising, and our advertising revenue growth is driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered. Our operational efficiency is influenced by our ability to effectively manage our technical infrastructure and respond to external influences, including changes in user behavior and regulatory requirements. The effectiveness of our IT capabilities is essential for supporting our business needs and enhancing our competitive advantage in the market.

The company relies on information technology systems to conduct its business, including recording and processing transactions, manufacturing and selling products, researching and developing new products, maintaining and growing its competitive position, and supporting and communicating with employees, customers, suppliers, and other vendors. These information technology systems are important to many business-critical processes including production planning, manufacturing, finance, company operations, sales, and customer service. Despite efforts to prevent disruptions to these information technology systems, they may be affected by damage or interruption resulting from cyber attacks, security breaches, phishing, malware, viruses, ransomware, power outages, or system failures. The risks could be magnified due to the increased reliance on information technology systems to conduct business, including those used in remote and hybrid in-office work environments. Disruptions to these systems may have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations, and financial condition. The domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security, collection, and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex, with new and rapidly changing requirements applicable to the business. Compliance with these requirements, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, could result in additional costs and changes to business practices. The company continues to mitigate risks associated with information technology through additional investment, engagement of third-party experts and consultants, improving the security of facilities and systems, and providing annual training for all employees. The company’s ability to attract, retain, develop, and progress a qualified workforce could adversely impact its business and impair its ability to meet strategic objectives and customer needs. Competition for talent is intense, and the company is facing increased wage rates and labor shortages due to a tightened labor market and macroeconomic conditions exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s strategic management practices include evaluating the integration of future acquisitions into existing operations, which is crucial for realizing expected returns on investments. The company’s financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow remain strong, with significant net operating cash generation despite ongoing raw material availability issues. The company has committed to spend a minimum of $600 million on capital expenditures for building a new headquarters and research and development center, with a focus on productivity improvement and maintenance projects at existing facilities and new store openings. The company’s ability to generate cash is subject to various factors, including general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond its control. The company’s operations are subject to various domestic and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including data privacy and security laws, which could adversely affect results of operations, cash flow, or financial condition. The company’s reliance on information technology systems is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and competitive advantage, and any failure to protect these systems could lead to significant operational disruptions and financial losses.

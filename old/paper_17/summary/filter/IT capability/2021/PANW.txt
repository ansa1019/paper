Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the effective management of our systems, processes, and controls, which are critical for our IT capability. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources, necessitating continuous improvement and expansion of our information technology and financial infrastructure. We must effectively manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner to sustain growth and improve operating results. The ongoing global economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and operating results, particularly as we navigate changes in end-customer spending priorities and purchasing decisions. Our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and subscriptions is influenced by the rapidly evolving technological and market developments, which require us to respond promptly to meet changing end-customer needs. Our reliance on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, including subscriptions and support, means that any failure of these partners to perform could limit our ability to sell and distribute our products. Additionally, our subscription and support revenue, which constitutes a significant portion of our total revenue, is recognized over the term of the relevant service period, impacting our financial results. The complexity of our products and subscriptions necessitates high-quality technical support services, and any failure to provide such support could adversely affect customer satisfaction and our ability to sell additional products. We face intense competition in our market, and our competitors may have substantial advantages, including greater resources to make strategic acquisitions or enter into partnerships. Our current research and development efforts may not produce successful products or features that result in significant revenue, and the success of new product introductions depends on our ability to manage risks associated with production ramp-up issues and the availability of application software. We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations, which could impose significant limitations or require changes to our business model, thereby increasing compliance expenses. Our ability to sell our products and subscriptions is dependent on the quality of our technical support services and those of our channel partners, and any failure to offer high-quality support could have a material adverse effect on our end-customers' satisfaction. We must continue to invest in innovation and acquire businesses to extend our capabilities and meet the needs of our end-customers. Our future performance depends on our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. The impacts of COVID-19 may curtail our end-customers' spending and lead to delays in purchasing decisions, which could materially adversely impact our business and financial performance. We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, but we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds to support our business growth.

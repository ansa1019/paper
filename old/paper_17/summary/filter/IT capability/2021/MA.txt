The global payments industry is highly competitive, with substantial and intense competition that may materially and adversely affect overall business and results of operations. Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside the global payments industry, including general purpose payments networks, alternative payments systems, and new entrants that leverage technology to support their services. The ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors, drive value for customers, and effectively align resources with goals and objectives is critical for maintaining competitive advantage. Rapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and limit future growth. Technological changes, including developments in smart cards, contactless payments, e-commerce, and blockchain technology, may result in new technologies that could render our current offerings obsolete. Our reliance on third parties for the development of new technologies presents risks, as their inability to keep pace with technological advancements could negatively impact our service offerings. The complexity of our payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities, and operational difficulties could lead to significant reputational risks. We are continually involved in developing complex multi-rail solutions and diversifying our integrated products and services to meet the evolving needs of the payments market. These efforts carry risks associated with cost overruns, delays in delivery, and performance problems. Our ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards, as well as by resistance from customers or merchants. Furthermore, our ability to effectively design and deliver multi-rail solutions and integrated products and services could be impacted by working with different types of customers, which may present new operational challenges. Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and increase costs. The proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication of cyber threats have heightened information security risks. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information, and any security breaches could lead to unauthorized disclosures or service interruptions. The regulatory environment surrounding privacy, data, and information security is increasingly complex, requiring monitoring and changes to data practices, which could impact our ability to leverage data for innovation. The expansion of our information profile through the collection of additional data amplifies the impact of these regulations. Additionally, the need for improved data management, governance, and quality practices is essential as we continue to develop integrated and personalized products and services. Our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers, and our relationships with them are vital for supporting our programs and services. The ability to attract and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce is crucial for our growth, particularly in technology and other skill areas significant to our business. Overall, our ability to navigate these challenges and leverage our IT capabilities effectively is essential for sustaining competitive positioning and achieving business objectives.

We face significant risks related to the spread of the COVID-19 virus, which has had, and will continue to have, significant effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The pandemic has subjected our business to operational challenges, including production site shutdowns and increased operational costs due to social distancing requirements. We continue to monitor health authorities for guidance concerning the pandemic, which may require us to impose additional operational restrictions. Our commercial airplanes business environment remains extremely competitive, with significant pressures on pricing and the need for continuous improvement in products and services. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic, influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, and technological advances. We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our business transformation efforts to enhance our ability to compete and position ourselves for market recovery. Our strategy emphasizes successful execution in core businesses, supported by Boeing Capital, which facilitates financing solutions for our customers. The demand outlook for our government services business remains stable, while the commercial services market continues to recover from the pandemic. Our suppliers are experiencing liquidity pressures and disruptions to their operations, which may impact our ability to meet customer commitments. We are actively managing our liquidity and have taken significant actions to preserve it, including reducing production rates based on ongoing assessments of demand and availability of aircraft financing. We expect to continue to experience operational challenges and inefficiencies due to COVID-19 impacts, which may affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our commercial airplanes production system is complex and relies on extensive coordination with suppliers and skilled labor. The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and certification schedules. We are also subject to unique risks related to U.S. government contracts, which may be modified, curtailed, or terminated without prior notice. The evolving nature of the national security threat environment and changes to U.S. national security strategy may impact our defense business. Additionally, we are exposed to cybersecurity threats that could negatively impact our operations and financial condition. We maintain a network of technical security controls and monitoring systems to address these threats. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers. We rely on other companies to provide raw materials and integrated components, and any disruptions could adversely affect our ability to meet commitments to customers. The complexity of our contracts and the need for accurate estimates of costs and revenues create financial risks, particularly in long-term contracts. We continue to assess our operational capabilities and market conditions to ensure we can respond effectively to changing business needs and maintain our competitive position.

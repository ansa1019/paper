In evaluating our business, we recognize that the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our operations and financial results, with increased risks including cybersecurity threats due to a remote workforce. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses, which require ongoing resources to maintain and enhance. The failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information systems, or the availability and integrity of our data, could adversely affect our business. We are subject to various federal, state, and international laws regarding the use and disclosure of sensitive information, and our facilities and systems are regularly targeted by cyber-attacks, which could disrupt our operations and expose us to liability. We have security technologies and processes in place to protect against these risks, but the evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates continuous enhancement of our controls and practices. Our ability to develop, implement, price, and support new and existing products and services depends on the integrity of the data we manage, and any inaccuracies could lead to disputes with customers and providers, regulatory problems, and increased operating expenses. The volume of healthcare data generated is rapidly expanding, and our information management capability is critical to providing timely and accurate data to users. We face significant competition in our markets, requiring us to adapt to changes in our industry and develop innovative products and services to satisfy evolving market demands. Our strategic growth opportunities include leveraging technology capabilities and enhancing our operational efficiency through process automation and optimization. We are also dependent on third-party service providers for certain information technology systems, and any disruption in their services could adversely affect our ability to meet customer obligations. Our strategic resource allocation is influenced by the need to maintain competitive pricing and manage healthcare costs effectively. The integration of technology into our business processes is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring operational flexibility. We continue to monitor the impacts of regulatory changes and market dynamics on our business, including the ongoing evolution of the ACA and its implications for our operations. Our future growth strategy includes expanding our technology infrastructure and capabilities to enhance service delivery and improve member experiences. The successful execution of our business strategy is contingent upon our ability to effectively manage our technology resources and align them with our organizational goals, ensuring that we remain responsive to market demands and competitive pressures.

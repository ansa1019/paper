Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including risks related to our global operations and the ability to establish effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies. We are subject to social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries, which could impact our operational efficiency and market responsiveness. The impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability may also affect our ability to manage our assets and internal processes effectively. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, and any economic downturn in that sector could adversely affect our business performance. We are exposed to technological changes, such as reconfiguration of supply chains and the integration of digital technologies, which may influence our operational flexibility and business strategy alignment. Our ability to recover investments in real estate assets may be impacted by current market conditions, including the need for process optimization and the management of operational costs. We recognize that disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to make distributions to security holders. Additionally, our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, which may result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements. We depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, and any loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. Our systems are vulnerable to damages from various sources, including cyber security attacks, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation. We continually evaluate our technology infrastructure and the effectiveness of our IT governance to mitigate risks associated with system failures and to enhance our information management capability. Our organizational capabilities are further supported by our strategic management practices, which include monitoring systems and evaluation systems that help us assess our performance linkage and operational efficiency. The transition to alternative reference rates due to the cessation of LIBOR could have a negative impact on our required debt payments and the value of our related debt and derivative financial instruments. We expect to fund our cash needs principally from fees earned for services performed on behalf of co-investment ventures, distributions received from these ventures, and proceeds from the contributions of properties. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms depends on various factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings. We also recognize the importance of leveraging our IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance our competitive advantage in the market. Our investments in emerging technology and digital infrastructure are aimed at improving our operational processes and customer relationships, which are critical to maintaining our market positioning and achieving business innovation.

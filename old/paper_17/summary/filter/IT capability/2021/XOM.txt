ExxonMobil's ability to maintain and grow its oil and gas production depends on the success of its exploration and development efforts, which require continuous improvement in identifying promising resource prospects and applying project management expertise to bring discovered resources online as scheduled and within budget. The long-term success of ExxonMobil's upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses, as well as the future success of lower-emission investments, depends on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects that require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors affecting major projects include the ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, and customers; model and optimize reservoir performance; and manage changes in operating conditions and costs. Effective management of individual projects and the overall portfolio, including diversification among types and locations of projects, products produced, and strategies to divest assets, is critical for mitigating risk and providing attractive returns to shareholders. An important component of ExxonMobil's competitive performance is its ability to operate efficiently, which includes managing expenses and improving production yields on an ongoing basis through technology improvements, cost control, productivity enhancements, and regular reappraisal of the asset portfolio. The company's technology, research, and development organizations must adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and continuously capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies. ExxonMobil's operations depend on management's ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations, control business activities, and minimize human error through rigorous management systems and continuous focus on safety and environmental risk management. The company employs a comprehensive enterprise risk management system to identify and manage risk across its businesses and maintains a disciplined framework of internal controls for compliance monitoring. Cybersecurity is a significant concern, with ExxonMobil subject to attempted disruptions from various sources, necessitating multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection, as well as non-technological measures such as threat information sharing and internal training. The company's future results and ability to grow its low carbon solutions business depend on the success of research and collaboration efforts and the ability to adapt and apply the strengths of its current business model to provide future energy products in a cost-competitive manner. The scale of the world's energy system requires appropriate support from governments and private participants to successfully transition to lower-emission energy technologies, with ExxonMobil's ability to develop and deploy these technologies at commercial scale depending on the continued development of supportive government policies and markets. Failure or delay of these policies could adversely impact investments, leading to unpredictable adverse effects on commodity price volatility and energy shortages. Overall, ExxonMobil's competitive positioning is influenced by its management effectiveness, operational efficiency, and the ability to leverage technology and innovation in response to market dynamics and external influences.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the effective management of our information technology and financial infrastructure, which is critical for supporting our growth and operational efficiency. We must continue to improve and expand our operating and administrative systems and controls to manage future growth effectively. The growth and expansion of our business place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources, necessitating enhancements in our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. Our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and subscriptions to existing end-customers is influenced by changes in end-customer requirements and market needs. We face intense competition in our market, particularly from larger, well-established companies that may have greater resources and capabilities to leverage technology and maintain competitive advantages. Our subscription and support revenue, which accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue, is derived from our ability to provide real-time access to the latest security capabilities. The complexity of our platform requires sophisticated technical support services, and our end-customers depend on our ability to resolve issues effectively. Our future success is contingent upon our ability to extend our technology leadership and improve our competitive position through innovation and timely development of new features and products. We are also subject to fluctuations in global macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our end-customers' spending priorities and delay purchasing decisions. Our reliance on manufacturing partners exposes us to risks related to supply chain management and the timely fulfillment of customer orders. We must effectively manage our supply and inventory to avoid lost sales opportunities or increased costs. Our investments in research and development are essential for maintaining our competitive position, and we expect to continue to dedicate significant resources to these efforts. The introduction of new products and services is critical to meeting the evolving needs of our end-customers and improving our market responsiveness. Our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues and the availability of application software is vital for successful product launches. Additionally, we must navigate the challenges of compliance with various regulatory requirements, which could impact our operational flexibility and financial performance. Our corporate structure is designed to align with the international nature of our business activities, and we must ensure that we achieve the anticipated financial and operational efficiencies. The effective mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources, combined with leveraging the value of other strategic resources, are fundamental to transforming our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities, encompassing the coordination of assets and internal processes, play a crucial role in supporting our business strategies and enhancing our overall performance.

Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including its supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the internet and third-party services, across its supply chain, which are critical to many of its operating activities and business processes. Nike's ability to effectively manage and maintain its inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis significantly depends on the reliability of these information technology systems. The ongoing work to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems and related processes in global operations is crucial, and Nike will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions, or other causes, could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduce operational efficiency, potentially requiring significant capital investments to remediate issues and adversely affecting reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. The company’s digital commerce operations are also critical, as they rely on effective, reliable, user-friendly digital platforms that meet the changing expectations of online shoppers. Any failure to provide such platforms could place Nike at a competitive disadvantage, result in lost sales, and harm its reputation. Additionally, the competitive nature of retail, including shifts in consumer shopping behaviors and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating Nike's direct-to-consumer and wholesale operations. The company’s strategy includes making its supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation, help reduce waste, and have long-term potential to increase customization of products and speed to market. Nike's commitment to product innovation and quality, along with its investments in design and marketing, are essential for maintaining brand image and reputation, which are critical for sustaining consumer demand. The effectiveness of Nike's information technology capabilities is also linked to its ability to manage consumer data securely, as breaches could result in loss of confidential business and financial data, damage to consumer relationships, and reputational harm. Furthermore, the company’s financial activities are supported by information technology systems that process financial information for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. The integration of technology into Nike's operations is a key element in driving growth and operational excellence, highlighting the importance of IT capability in supporting business strategies and enhancing overall firm performance.

The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs; the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, including the withdrawal of legacy TDM-based services; our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition; the ability of our competitors to offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to lower cost structures and regulatory and legislative actions adverse to us; our ability to manage growth in wireless video and data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms; changes in our corporate strategies, such as changing network-related requirements or acquisitions and dispositions, which may require significant amounts of cash or stock, to respond to competition and regulatory, legislative and technological developments; and the impact from major equipment failures on our networks, including satellites operated by DirectTV; the effect of security breaches related to the network or customer information; our inability to obtain handsets, equipment/software or have handsets, equipment/software serviced in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers. Our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies or delivery methods, and our ability to maintain capital expenditures are critical. The continued development and delivery of attractive and profitable video and broadband offerings; our ability to match speeds offered by our competitors and the availability, cost and/or reliability of the various technologies and/or content required to provide such offerings are essential to our market positioning. The uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions may result in a significant decrease in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general. Our ability to adequately fund our wireless operations, including payment for additional spectrum, network upgrades and technological advancements, is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. The final outcome of FCC and other federal, state or foreign government agency proceedings involving issues that are important to our business, including privacy, net neutrality, deregulation of IP-based services, and the availability of new spectrum on fair and balanced terms, will significantly impact our operational capabilities. The extent of competition, including from governmental networks and other providers, and the resulting pressure on customer totals and segment operating margins will influence our strategic resource allocation and operational efficiency. Our ability to close our pending acquisition of Time Warner Inc. and successfully reorganize our operations, including managing various businesses in widely dispersed business locations and with decentralized management, is vital for enhancing our IT capabilities and overall firm performance. The impact of changes in corporate strategies on our technology deployment and resource integration will also be significant in navigating the evolving business environment.

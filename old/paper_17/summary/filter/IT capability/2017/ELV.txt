The ongoing changes in federal and state laws and regulations stemming from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) continue to represent significant challenges to the U.S. health care system. These laws impose significant fees, assessments, and taxes on health insurers, which may not be recoverable in premium rates. The ACA has introduced new risks, regulatory challenges, and uncertainties, requiring changes in the way products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed, and administered. The individual market risk pool has become less healthy, and the reduction of the individual mandate penalty to zero is expected to further deteriorate the overall risk pool. Insurers face uncertainties related to federal government funding for various ACA programs, which may adversely affect results of operations if premiums do not adequately reflect the acuity of individuals.

The company has implemented security enhancements since this incident and continues to prioritize cybersecurity and the development of controls to protect its systems and data.

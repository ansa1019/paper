In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, it is crucial to consider the evolving needs of our markets and the identification of new products, services, or technologies, as failure to do so may adversely impact our revenue and financial results. Our success is contingent upon our ability to develop the infrastructure necessary to scale our business, including customer service and support, while meeting customer safety and compliance standards. We continue to invest significantly in research and development, which may not yield substantial revenue for several years. Our strategic direction must result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners; otherwise, we risk failing to adapt our strategy to exploit potential market opportunities. The competitive landscape is intensifying, and our competitors may have advantages such as lower costs, superior functionality, and greater financial resources, which could hinder our ability to grow revenue. System security and data protection breaches pose risks that could disrupt operations and increase expenses, thereby adversely affecting our stock price and reputation. We rely on third-party products and services for portions of our IT infrastructure, which may also be vulnerable to breaches. To counter these threats, we must continuously enhance the security and reliability of our products, which may lead to increased expenses. Breaches of security measures or the loss of sensitive data could expose us to litigation and regulatory inquiries, further impacting our business. Our reliance on third-party foundries and subcontractors for manufacturing and assembly introduces risks that could affect our ability to meet customer demand and impact our gross margin. We also depend on third-party software development tools, which have previously caused delays in product introductions due to their inability to fully simulate our products' complex features. Achieving design wins is critical to our success, and any failure to do so could result in lost revenue and weakened market position. Business disruptions from natural disasters, geopolitical changes, or cyber-attacks could significantly harm our operations and financial results. Our operations are subject to various international risks, including political tensions and regulatory changes, which may adversely affect our business. Attracting and retaining skilled employees is essential for executing our business strategy effectively, and competition for talent in our industry is fierce. We may face challenges in integrating acquisitions or strategic investments, which could impede our growth and product development. Protecting our intellectual property rights is vital, as failure to do so could harm our competitive position. Our operating results have fluctuated due to various factors, including our ability to meet customer demand and manage inventory effectively. Privacy concerns regarding our products could damage our reputation and lead to regulatory penalties. The recent tax law changes may impact our financial results, and we continue to evaluate their effects on our business. Our liquidity is supported by cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which we believe will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements.

The global payments industry is highly competitive, with substantial and intense competition worldwide that may materially and adversely affect overall business and results of operations. The payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact business in several ways, including technological developments in areas such as smart cards, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. These changes could result in new and innovative payment methods and programs that could place the company at a competitive disadvantage and reduce the use of its products. The ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards, as well as resistance from customers or merchants to such changes. The company relies on third parties, including some competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies, which could negatively impact offerings if these companies fail to keep pace with technological developments. The complexity of new payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities that differ from those faced on the core network. The acquisition of Vocalink expanded the capability to process automated clearing house transactions, presenting both business opportunities and regulatory risks associated with administering a new type of payments network. The operational challenges and costs associated with integrating new products and technology into existing markets are significant, and failure to manage this integration could result in larger-than-expected costs and loss of business. The company also faces risks related to information security incidents or account data compromise events, which could disrupt business, damage reputation, increase costs, and cause losses. Information security risks have significantly increased due to the proliferation of new technologies and the sophistication of organized crime and hackers. The operations rely on secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information, with customers and other parties in the payments value chain depending on the company’s digital technologies and systems. The company maintains an information security program and continually tests systems to discover and address vulnerabilities, but there is no assurance against material breaches or losses in the future. The company’s ability to innovate and offer differentiated products may be limited by regulatory changes that could impose costly compliance burdens or otherwise increase operational costs. The focus on compliance with privacy, data protection, and information security regulations could increase costs and negatively impact growth. The company's relationships with financial institutions and other stakeholders are critical to maintaining competitiveness, and any loss of business from significant customers could lead to substantial revenue decreases. The ongoing evolution of the payments industry, including the emergence of alternative payment systems and digital players, necessitates continuous adaptation and innovation to remain competitive. The company's strategic initiatives and investments in technology are essential for enhancing operational efficiency and achieving business objectives in a dynamic market environment.

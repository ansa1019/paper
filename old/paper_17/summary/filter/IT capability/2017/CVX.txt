Chevron's operations are subject to various risks, including those related to cybersecurity and the integrity of its information technology (IT) systems. The company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents that could compromise its process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment, or loss, misuse, or corruption of critical data and proprietary information. The company devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether housed internally or by external third parties. However, it has limited control and visibility over third-party IT systems, which increases its exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts associated with them. The evolving risks to cybersecurity from various threat actors, including criminal hackers and state-sponsored intrusions, highlight the importance of robust IT capabilities in supporting business needs and maintaining operational efficiency. Furthermore, the company's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets, which includes evaluating the impact of cyber threats on its overall business strategy and operational resilience. The integration of information management capabilities into Chevron's strategic planning processes is essential for ensuring accurate, timely, and reliable data provision to users, thereby enhancing decision-making speed and operational flexibility. The company's reliance on digital infrastructure and IT capabilities underscores the necessity of aligning technology resources with organizational goals to effectively respond to market dynamics and competitive pressures. Additionally, the management of information technology resources is critical for maintaining the company's competitive advantage and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The potential for significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, and reputational harm due to cyber threats necessitates a comprehensive approach to IT governance and resource allocation. The company's ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in conjunction with other strategic resources is vital for achieving business transformation and enhancing firm performance in a rapidly changing business environment. As Chevron navigates the complexities of the global energy market, the effective management of its IT capabilities will play a crucial role in supporting its operational objectives and driving innovation within its business processes.

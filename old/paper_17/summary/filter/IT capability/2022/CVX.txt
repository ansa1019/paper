Chevron's operations are subject to numerous risks, including those related to cybersecurity, which could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations. Cyber threat actors, whether internal or external, are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their attempts to access the company's information technology (IT) systems and data. The company devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, but it continues to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees. Cyber events could compromise critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment, or loss of critical data and proprietary information. The company's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets, incorporating potential ranges of physical risks into capital investment reviews and decisions. However, it is difficult to predict the timing, frequency, or severity of such events, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations or financial condition. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources, and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that may arise from significant incidents. Furthermore, the company's operations are subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including cyber threats, which could materially impact its business performance. The evolving landscape of digital technologies necessitates that Chevron continuously enhance its IT capabilities to effectively support business needs and to leverage strategic resources. The firm’s IT capabilities encompass the mobilization and deployment of IT-based resources in conjunction with other organizational capabilities to achieve operational efficiency and competitive advantage. The integration of IT systems is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and for optimizing business processes, which are essential for responding to market dynamics and consumer demands. Additionally, the company faces challenges related to the management of information, including ensuring data accuracy, reliability, and security. The ability to provide timely and relevant information to users is vital for effective decision-making and for aligning with changing business strategies. As the company navigates the complexities of the energy sector, it must also consider the implications of regulatory changes and environmental factors on its IT infrastructure and capabilities. The alignment of technology resources with organizational goals is crucial for enhancing performance metrics and achieving business value. The company’s commitment to developing its IT capabilities is integral to its strategic management practices and to fostering innovation partnerships that can drive business transformation and resilience.

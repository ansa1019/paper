We rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue. Our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors, or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures, and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. We must process, record, and monitor a large number of transactions, and our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, and external fraud. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls, and technologies to protect systems, client accounts, and data. Our business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions. Our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, ransomware, and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss, or destruction of data. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches. We also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients' personal information to gain access to their financial accounts. Our reliance on cloud technologies is growing, and cloud service disruptions may lead to delays in accessing data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients' access to our platforms. We have undertaken extensive planning and testing for the integration of TD Ameritrade, which includes significant investments in technology enhancements. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses, or unexpected integration issues, which could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs. Our technology infrastructure is critical to our operations, and we continue to invest in technology to support growth in our client base. The company's risk management program is designed to identify and manage risks associated with operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks, and includes a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered in our business activities. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement, and other financial institutions to address potential threats. Our ability to attract and retain talent is essential for maintaining our competitive position, particularly in technology roles, as demand for skilled technology professionals is high. We have established policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and we utilize control testing programs and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The integration of TD Ameritrade's risk management practices with Schwab's risk appetite is ongoing, and we are committed to ensuring that our operations remain consistent with our enterprise risk management framework.

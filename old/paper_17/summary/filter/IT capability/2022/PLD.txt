Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including risks related to our global operations, business financing, and capital. As a global company, we are subject to social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries, which may impact our ability to establish effective controls and procedures to regulate operations and monitor compliance with applicable regulations. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, including the value of our properties and our ability to make principal and interest payments or refinance outstanding debt. We are exposed to economic conditions and events in the local, regional, national, and international geographies in which we own properties, which may impact financial results. Our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of specific markets where we have concentrations of properties, such as California, Atlanta, Chicago, and others. Technological changes, such as reconfiguration of supply chains and advancements in logistics, could affect the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers and competition from other available properties. Our ability to reposition our properties in response to changes in business and logistics needs is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage. We may encounter risks associated with the acquisition of properties, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated. Integration of newly acquired companies and realization of anticipated synergies may be challenging, potentially impacting our operational efficiency and strategic resource allocation. Our real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful, and we may face difficulties in obtaining financing for development projects on favorable terms. We are also subject to risks related to forming and attracting third-party investment in co-investment ventures, which may impact our ability to realize value from existing or future investments. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, which may expose us to economic downturns in that sector. Our business may be adversely affected by deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, which could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements. We depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks, which may result in material disruptions and additional costs. Despite various security measures, our systems remain vulnerable to damages from numerous sources, including cyber security threats. The growing frequency of cyber attacks may lead to increased costs to protect the company and respond to any incidents. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from co-investment ventures, and available financing sources is essential to meet our anticipated future development and operational needs. We expect to be cautious in evaluating capital deployment activities due to uncertain macroeconomic conditions and their impact on real estate valuations. Our strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset management and property management services, which fluctuate based on changes in the size of portfolios and market conditions. We also generate operating cash through our strategic capital segment by providing services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

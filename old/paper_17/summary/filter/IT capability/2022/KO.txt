The company relies on networks and information systems to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, employee processes, consumer marketing, mergers and acquisitions, and research and development. Information systems are critical to many of the company's operating activities, and the business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions, or cybersecurity incidents. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine operations, user errors, network or hardware failures, malicious software, cyberattacks, or other catastrophic events. The company continues to make investments in personnel, technologies, and training to address risks to its information systems. The digital evolution is affecting how the company interacts with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, and other business partners and stakeholders, making it a top priority to digitalize operations through the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics, and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. The company must continuously strengthen its capabilities in marketing and innovation to compete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market share. The rapid growth of e-commerce has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns, requiring the company to adapt its strategies accordingly. The company’s ability to achieve its sustainability goals is dependent on many factors, including the actions of various stakeholders, such as bottling partners and suppliers, which are outside of its control. The company acknowledges that it has a role to play in developing and implementing solutions related to sustainability challenges, including sustainable packaging and water stewardship. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has resulted in increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to information systems, which could negatively impact operations. The company’s information systems are a target of attacks, and third-party providers may also experience cybersecurity incidents that could involve data shared with them. The company is subject to various privacy and data protection laws, which impose operational requirements and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements across jurisdictions. The company’s ability to manage third-party relationships effectively is crucial, as failure to do so could result in financial, legal, reputational, and operational risks. The company’s digitalization initiatives are aimed at creating more relevant and personalized experiences for consumers and enhancing operational efficiencies. The success of these initiatives is critical for increasing sales and improving margins, and the costs incurred in connection with these initiatives may adversely impact financial performance if not managed effectively. The company’s strategic priorities include developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives and embedding sustainability goals into operations, which are essential for maintaining competitiveness in a rapidly evolving market landscape.

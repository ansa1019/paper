Information technology (IT) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships. IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. The company employs information technology systems and networks to support the business and relies on them to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to the information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, and cybersecurity incidents could interfere with operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact reputation. Cybersecurity is a critical component of the company's enterprise risk management program, with global cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at the company, its products, its customers, and/or its third-party service providers. The company seeks to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, and continuous monitoring of IT networks and systems. The company recognizes that cybersecurity incidents could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption, or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information, theft of funds, and disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. The company also faces risks related to operational flexibility and the ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements, which may be constrained by suppliers' inability to scale production and adjust delivery during times of volatile demand. The company’s future growth is largely dependent upon its ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. The company regularly reviews its portfolio of businesses and pursues growth through acquisitions while seeking to divest non-core businesses. The effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting is assessed regularly, and management has determined that it maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. The company is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to macroeconomic conditions, supply chain disruptions, and changes in government regulations, which could adversely affect its ability to implement and execute its business strategy. The company continues to monitor the activities in corporate and all other to determine the need for further reportable business segment disaggregation. The company’s IT governance framework is designed to ensure that IT resources are aligned with business needs and that investments in IT capabilities are made in a manner that supports strategic objectives and enhances operational efficiency.

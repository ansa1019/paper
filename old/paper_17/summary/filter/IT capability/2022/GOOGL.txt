Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including intense competition and the need to innovate to remain competitive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. We must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant, and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. Our ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies, including artificial intelligence, reflects our efforts to enhance our technology and offerings. We devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support these services. The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, which are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from various threats, including cyber attacks and natural disasters. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage companies with the necessary capabilities or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations. We rely on contract manufacturers for the assembly of our hardware products and servers, and we may face risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management that could affect our ability to supply our products and services. Our investments in technical infrastructure, including servers and network equipment, are critical for ongoing business activities and support the growth of our services and products. We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus to develop new, innovative offerings and improve existing offerings across our businesses. Our ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel. We face risks associated with our intellectual property rights, which are important assets for us, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete. Our products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information, and any security breaches could harm our business and reputation. We are subject to various laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and we face ongoing scrutiny from regulatory authorities regarding our business practices. Our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the evolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. The effectiveness of our technology and the ability to leverage our IT capabilities are crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving operational efficiency. Our ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data. We expect to continue to experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems, which may increase risks associated with our IT capabilities.

nee and fpl are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems, and any failure or breach of those systems could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. nee's and fpl's business is highly dependent on their ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and cross numerous and diverse markets. the development and maintenance of information technology systems to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging. if nee's or fpl's information technology systems were to fail or be breached, sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised, and nee and fpl could be unable to fulfill critical business functions. the operations and businesses of nee and fpl are subject to extensive federal regulation, which generally imposes significant and increasing compliance costs on their operations and businesses. compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject nee and fpl to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. the regulatory process limits or could otherwise adversely impact fpl's earnings, and any inability or failure to address the effects of regulation on their business could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. nee and fpl are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and other standards that may result in capital expenditures, increased operating costs and various liabilities, and may require them to limit or eliminate certain operations. these regulations could prevent or delay the development of power generation, power or natural gas transmission, or other infrastructure projects, restrict or enjoin the output of some existing facilities, and otherwise increase costs. the ability of nee and fpl to proceed with projects under development and to complete construction of, and capital improvement projects for, their electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, gas infrastructure facilities and other facilities on schedule and within budget have been, and may be, adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and labor and regulatory compliance. the ability of nee and fpl to develop solar generation facilities is dependent on the international supply chain for solar panels and associated equipment, and governmental or regulatory actions have caused minor, and could in the future cause material, disruptions in the ability of nee and fpl to acquire solar panels on time and at acceptable costs. the operational risks associated with facility start-up operations, including whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule, and failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supplies, could materially adversely affect nee's and fpl's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. the risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices are also significant, as these factors can influence the financial performance of nee and fpl. the management of counterparty credit risk is essential for their energy marketing and trading operations, and the failure of counterparties to fulfill their financial obligations could result in material financial losses. the integration of technology capabilities is critical for optimizing the value of power generation and gas infrastructure assets, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. the reliance on information technology systems for operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and strategic resource allocation underscores the importance of these capabilities in supporting business needs and enhancing competitive advantage.

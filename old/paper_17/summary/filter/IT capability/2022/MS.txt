We have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to business conduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. The heightened legal and regulatory focus on the financial services and banking industries globally presents a continuing business challenge for us. Our climate risk management efforts are overseen by the climate risk committee, which shapes our approach to managing climate-related risks in line with our overall risk framework.

Our business may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, international relations, and geopolitical events and actions, which could impact our operational flexibility and market responsiveness. The current global supply chain and labor market challenges have negatively affected our performance, as well as the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. We rely on our suppliers and subcontractors, who have been impacted by ongoing pandemic-related issues, to meet our operational needs. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in advanced technologies depends on various factors, including execution of internal and external performance plans and the availability and quality of supplier-produced parts and materials. We continuously monitor labor market conditions and trends and work to mitigate constraints through talent acquisition and workforce succession planning. Our digital transformation initiative aims to improve our business and reduce costs by leveraging digital capabilities throughout our operations. We face risks associated with our U.S. government contracts, including the requirement for digital engineering and other digital capabilities, which could impact our ability to achieve anticipated benefits. Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include attacks on our IT infrastructure and the IT infrastructure of our customers and suppliers, which could disrupt our systems and impact business operations. We continue to make investments in cybersecurity measures to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities. Our performance is also dependent on the condition of the aerospace industry, which is cyclical and influenced by various factors, including economic conditions and customer demand. The introduction of new products and technologies involves risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. Our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel is critical to our operational effectiveness, especially in a competitive labor market. We have experienced significant difficulties in hiring and retaining personnel with relevant qualifications, which has negatively impacted our results of operations. Our business is subject to various legal and compliance risks, including those related to product safety, intellectual property rights, and government contracts. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations could lead to new investments in product designs and facility upgrades, increasing our operational and compliance expenditures. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export and import of products, services, and technology, which could impact our ability to conduct business internationally. Our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits, which may require significant adjustments to contract prices. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and IT security systems to protect our intellectual property. Our competitive position may be adversely affected by limitations on our ability to obtain necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or provision of our products or services. The evolving nature of cybersecurity and data security laws presents increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs and affect our competitiveness. Our business and financial performance may also be adversely affected by climate change and governmental actions taken in response, which present risks to our financial condition.

ExxonMobil's ability to manage its operations efficiently is a critical component of its competitive performance, which includes continuous management focus on technology improvements, cost control, productivity enhancements, and the recruitment, development, and retention of high-caliber employees. The company's research and development organizations must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To remain competitive, ExxonMobil must continuously adapt and capture the benefits of new and emerging technologies, including successfully applying advances in the ability to process very large amounts of data to its businesses. The effectiveness of ExxonMobil's management systems and controls is essential to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and petrochemical operations and to control effectively its business activities. Cybersecurity is a significant concern, as the company is regularly subject to attempted disruptions from various threat actors, necessitating multi-layered technological capabilities for prevention and detection. The company's defensive preparedness includes non-technological measures such as threat information sharing with governmental and industry groups and internal training campaigns that emphasize resiliency. ExxonMobil's operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters, and human error, which necessitates robust facility engineering and rigorous disaster preparedness and response planning. The competitive landscape is characterized by not only competition from private firms but also from state-owned companies that may pursue opportunities with less focus on financial returns. The company faces risks from political or regulatory developments affecting operations, including access limitations to oil and gas resources and restrictions on foreign investment. The lack of legal certainty in some countries where ExxonMobil operates exposes the company to increased risk of adverse actions by government officials. The company's reputation is an important corporate asset, and adverse events such as significant cybersecurity disruptions or changes in consumer views could negatively impact its ability to compete for new opportunities. ExxonMobil's future business results depend on its ability to manage both external economic and political factors and those that are within its control, impacting its performance relative to competition. The long-term success of ExxonMobil's upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses relies on complex, long-term, capital-intensive projects that require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency. The company must continuously improve its ability to identify promising resource prospects and apply project management expertise to bring discovered resources online as scheduled and within budget. The effectiveness of the company's overall portfolio management, including diversification among types and locations of projects, is crucial for mitigating risk and providing attractive returns to shareholders.

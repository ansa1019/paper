Risks related to the company's business include the failure of innovation initiatives, which could impact long-term success, as IBM is moving into areas that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, quantum, and other disruptive technologies. The ability to continue cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment is crucial for maintaining and increasing market share and profit margins. The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains, but client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive segments. The company must adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, and emerging business models to avoid declines in client demand for products or services. The company's intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitive offerings, and its ability to protect intellectual property could be impacted by changes to existing laws and regulations. The company is subject to various risks from acquisitions, alliances, and dispositions, including integration challenges and the failure to achieve strategic objectives. The company's internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements due to inherent limitations, which could harm business and operating results. The company seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility, and cost savings through continuous transformation using automation, artificial intelligence, and agile processes. However, these initiatives may not yield intended gains in speed, quality, and productivity, impacting competitiveness and the ability to meet growth objectives. The company is also exposed to cybersecurity and data privacy risks, which could impact business operations and customer trust. Cyber threats are continually evolving, making it difficult to defend against vulnerabilities. Successful cybersecurity attacks could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, leading to potential liability and damage to brand reputation. The regulatory environment regarding cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection is increasingly complex, impacting the company's business through increased costs and compliance obligations. The company's reliance on skilled employees is critical for future success, and competition for talent is intense. The company may face challenges in realigning, training, and scaling skilled resources in response to shifting global opportunities and industry demand. Additionally, the company's business could be impacted by its relationships with critical suppliers, as reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain components could affect the ability to bring products to market. The company must also navigate risks related to market liquidity conditions and customer credit risk, which could negatively impact revenue and business performance. Overall, the company's ability to manage these various risks and challenges is essential for maintaining operational efficiency, achieving strategic objectives, and sustaining competitive advantage in the market.

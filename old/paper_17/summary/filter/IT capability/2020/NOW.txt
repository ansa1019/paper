Our business could be harmed by any of these risks, including reduced IT spending or delayed digital transformation initiatives by customers in industries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The ongoing pandemic has disrupted the flow of the economy and put unprecedented strains on businesses, which could lead to reduced customer demand and spending. We must accurately predict and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological, market, and customer developments to maintain our competitive position. The markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry, and as the market for digital workflow products matures, we expect competition to intensify. Our customers are increasingly adopting digital technologies, and we must invest in and continually optimize our technology platform to meet high performance expectations. To compete effectively, we must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies, accurately predict our customers' changing business needs, and efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers' digital environments. Our success depends on our ability to attract new customers, retain and increase sales to existing customers, and satisfy their requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our operational and financial performance, affecting our ability to generate new business and manage customer relationships. We are focused on maintaining business continuity and preparing for the future by developing applications to help customers navigate the pandemic. Our subscription-based business model provides predictable revenues, but the effects of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We have made substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure to support our growth and enhance our service offerings. Our professional services organization is focused on strategic advisory, implementation, and consulting services to accelerate platform adoption and drive customer outcomes. We also rely on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for implementation services delivery. Our ability to effectively manage and grow our network of partners is crucial for selling our products and efficiently providing our services. Privacy laws and evolving regulations related to data and the internet may adversely affect our business, as compliance with these regulations could impact our ability to develop and offer our services. We must successfully continue to release new products and updates to meet customer needs and expectations. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of customers' confidential data, and we face significant risks related to cybersecurity threats. A security breach could result in reputational damage and significant costs. The extent and continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on various developments, including government responses and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. Our ability to grow our business internationally is essential, as sales outside of North America represented a significant portion of our total revenues. We face various risks related to compliance with governmental laws and regulations, particularly in heavily regulated industries. We must effectively manage these risks to ensure our business's success and maintain our competitive advantage in the market.

The global payments industry is highly competitive, with substantial and intense competition that may materially and adversely affect overall business and results of operations. Our payment programs compete against all forms of payment, including electronic, mobile, and e-commerce payment platforms, which can impact our business. The ability to compete may also be affected by the outcomes of litigation, competition-related regulatory proceedings, and central bank activity. We rely on third parties for the development of and access to new technologies, and our ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards. The payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact our business in several ways, including the development of new technologies that may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use. Our ability to keep pace with technological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies is critical, as failure to do so could lead to a decline in the use of our products. We also face risks associated with disintermediation, where parties that process our transactions may try to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment process. Regulatory requirements may enable third-party providers to route payment transactions away from our network, which could diminish demand for our integrated products and services. The complexity of our payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities that differ from those faced on our core network. Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and increase our costs. We are subject to increasingly complex regulations related to privacy, data, and information security, which could result in negative impacts on our business. The expansion of our information profile through the collection of additional data has amplified the impact of these regulations. Regulatory scrutiny of privacy and data security often requires monitoring and changes to our data practices, which could increase costs and restrict our ability to leverage data for innovation. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers. The advent of the global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant rise in information security threats due to increased remote work environments. The risks associated with information security and service disruptions remain a priority for us, as cyber-threats continue to evolve and may require significant additional resources to enhance protective measures. Our ability to deliver integrated products and services effectively depends on our relationships with our customers and their ability to manage our brands. The continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers are crucial for supporting our programs and services. We depend on our customers to innovate and maintain competitiveness in the market, as we do not issue cards or extend credit to account holders. Our business significantly relies on the strength of our relationships with our customers, as well as their relationships with account holders and merchants. Failure to attract, hire, and retain highly qualified employees, particularly in technology, could harm our overall business and results of operations.

Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including its supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. Information technology systems are critical to many of Nike's operating activities and business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. The ability to effectively manage and maintain inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Nike has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions where it operates, and its work to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems and related processes is ongoing, with continued investment in these efforts. However, there is no assurance that the measures taken to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect against cyber-attacks, system failures, or data loss. The failure of these systems to operate effectively could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations, potentially requiring significant capital investments to remediate issues. Nike's digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks, and standards that it does not control. The company may not be successful in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies, and any difficulties in accessing and using its digital platforms could adversely impact its operations. The ongoing investment in digital technologies and information systems for Nike's digital operations is essential for delivering high-quality digital experiences and enhancing consumer engagement. The company's strategic management practices include unifying investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, and inventory management against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate digital transformation. The competitive nature of retail, including shifts in consumer shopping behaviors and the continued proliferation of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating Nike's direct and wholesale operations. The company continues to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and has made certain assumptions regarding its operating, financial, and tax planning projections. The impact of COVID-19 has led to significant disruptions in operations, including store closures and reduced retail traffic, which have adversely affected sales and financial results. The company is focused on optimizing its operating models across its global portfolio and remains committed to investing in significant growth opportunities, particularly in digital capabilities and technology infrastructure.

Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including risks related to our global operations and the ability to establish effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies. We are subject to social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries, which may impact our ability to manage our information technology capabilities effectively. The technological changes, such as reconfiguration of supply chains and the integration of digital technologies, could affect our operational efficiency and business performance. Our ability to adapt to these changes is crucial for maintaining our competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. We face challenges in managing our IT resources, including the need for operational flexibility and the capability to mobilize technology effectively in support of our business strategies. The impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability may also influence our IT governance and the strategic alignment of our technology capabilities with organizational goals. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial condition and our capacity to invest in IT infrastructure and digital transformation initiatives. Additionally, our dependence on key personnel with deep industry knowledge and management skills is vital for leveraging our IT capabilities to enhance business value. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of our business continuity and communication plans, which rely heavily on our technology deployment and information management capabilities. We have not experienced significant disruptions in our operations due to our robust IT systems, but any system failures or cybersecurity attacks could result in material disruptions and adversely affect our business. Our investments in technology management and the development of our IT architecture are essential for optimizing our business processes and enhancing our operational effectiveness. The ability to provide accurate and timely information to users, while ensuring data confidentiality and security, is a critical aspect of our information processing capacity. We recognize that the integration of IT capabilities into our business processes is necessary for achieving performance gains and maintaining market responsiveness. Our strategic management practices must continuously evolve to address the challenges posed by environmental factors and regulatory contexts that impact our operational agility. The successful deployment of our technology portfolio is integral to our organizational transformation and the realization of actionable investments that drive performance improvement. We are committed to enhancing our IT capabilities to support our strategic resource allocation and to ensure that we can respond effectively to consumer demands and competitive actions in the marketplace.

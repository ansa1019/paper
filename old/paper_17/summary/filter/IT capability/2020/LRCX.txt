The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand, which may lead to variability in our customers' business plans and consequently impact demand for our equipment and services. Variability in customer investments is dependent on several factors, including economic conditions and our customers' ability to develop increasingly complex semiconductor devices. During periods of rapid growth or decline, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, and information systems. Our ability to meet these challenges is crucial for sustaining our gross margins and earnings. The recent COVID-19 outbreak has further impacted our ability to meet product demand due to production and logistics challenges, necessitating modifications to our business processes and the implementation of business continuity plans. We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment, as inadequate adaptation may result in a lack of infrastructure and resources to scale up our business effectively. Our success depends significantly on the ability of our executive officers and senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. We depend on creating new products and enhancing existing ones, and our future success relies on our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities. The emergence of big data and new tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence is leading semiconductor manufacturers to pursue new products and approaches that exploit these tools. Our investments in research and development are focused on leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing processes, and we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully to avoid adversely affecting our sales. Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which are influenced by market demand for integrated circuits. We face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities, which are concentrated in a limited number of locations and subject to various disruptions. Our operations are also affected by our customers' use of our products in their wafer fabrication processes, and any technological changes that reduce the number of steps required could significantly impact our business. We are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change and must invest significantly in R&D to remain competitive. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to our success, as is our ability to manage relationships with key customers and suppliers. We maintain and rely upon critical information systems for the effective operation of our business, which are susceptible to cybersecurity threats. While we have implemented security procedures to mitigate risks, these systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe. Our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities, and we are subject to various risks related to compliance with laws and regulations affecting our operations. Overall, our ability to navigate these challenges and leverage our IT capabilities will be essential for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving operational efficiency.

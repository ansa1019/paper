Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those related to our ability to effectively manage future growth and improve our systems, processes, and controls. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings place a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. We have experienced growth and increased demand for our products and subscriptions, which necessitates improvements to our information technology capabilities to support business needs. Our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and subscriptions to existing end-customers is critical, particularly in light of the competitive landscape and the need for operational flexibility. We continue to invest in innovation and acquire businesses to extend the capabilities of our portfolio, which is essential for meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. Our subscription and support revenue has grown significantly, reflecting increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. The integration of technology capabilities into our offerings is crucial for operational efficiency and enhancing customer value. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. The impacts of COVID-19 may curtail our end-customers' spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, which may adversely affect our business performance. We must adapt to changing market dynamics and ensure that our technology infrastructure is capable of supporting our growth and operational requirements. Our reliance on manufacturing partners and third-party service providers for our products and services necessitates a robust IT architecture to manage these relationships effectively. The complexity of our offerings requires significant investments in research and development to enhance our technology capabilities and maintain our competitive advantage. Our ability to provide high-quality technical support services is also critical to ensuring customer satisfaction and loyalty. The management of our information technology resources and capabilities is vital for sustaining business transformation and achieving operational excellence. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to enhance our organizational effectiveness and improve our performance metrics. The strategic alignment of our technology portfolio with our business objectives is essential for navigating the challenges posed by competitive actions and market restructuring. Our focus on developing actionable investments in technology will enable us to respond effectively to evolving consumer demands and market opportunities.

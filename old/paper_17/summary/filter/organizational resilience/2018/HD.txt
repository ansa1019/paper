Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could negatively impact our ability to maintain organizational resilience. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, and we must regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape. Intense competitive pressures from competitors or our inability to adapt effectively to a changing competitive landscape could adversely affect our prices, margins, or demand for our products and services. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, consumer preferences, and unexpected weather conditions or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution centers. We must continually anticipate and adapt to changes in the purchasing process, and our ability to be competitive on delivery times and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in supply chain management. The implementation of our interconnected retail, supply chain, and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. Our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly qualified associates while controlling labor costs is critical to our operational flexibility and overall organizational health. A failure of a key information technology system could adversely affect our business, as we rely extensively on these systems to manage transactions and data. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and lead to negative customer experiences. Additionally, disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our ability to deliver inventory in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand and result in lost sales. Our business is subject to seasonal influences, and uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions could impact our operations and financial performance. If we fail to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers, our ability to access products that meet our high standards for quality could be adversely affected. We have established processes to manage regulatory requirements and ensure customer satisfaction with our services, but failures in these processes could result in lost sales and reputational damage. Our strategic transactions involve risks that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions. Changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. Our international operations face unique risks, including political instability and trade policy changes, which could adversely impact our sales and profitability. The inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, and profit margins. We are predominantly self-insured for various risks, and significant claims could adversely impact our financial condition. Our ability to manage and adapt to these challenges is essential for maintaining resilience and ensuring our organizational success in a competitive and evolving market environment.

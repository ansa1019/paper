The company faces a number of uncertainties and risks that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the company's control. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the company's business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way. The company is subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability, and claims that their product sales, marketing, and pricing practices violate various laws. While the company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. Product reliability, safety, and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation, and cause reputational damage. Concerns about product safety can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, and regulatory action, which can adversely affect the company's functioning and brand equity. The company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. The company is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high-quality, innovative products and services, which reflects its strategic initiatives and adaptability to evolving market demands. The company relies on both internal information technology systems and those of third parties to process and store sensitive data, and the extensive information security threats pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems. The company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities. The company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, there is potential for adverse impacts. The company has achieved approximately $0.7 billion of annualized pre-tax cost savings through restructuring actions, which will provide added flexibility and resources to fund investment in new growth opportunities. The company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs for the next twelve months. The company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly and strives to maintain profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements, and periodic price increases. The company remains focused on addressing the unmet needs of society and investing for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its stakeholders. The company is aware that its products are used in an environment where policymakers, consumers, and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care, and it continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions.

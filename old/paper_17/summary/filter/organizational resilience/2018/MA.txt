Regulators increasingly seek to regulate certain aspects of payments systems such as ours, which may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations. Increased regulation and oversight of payment systems may result in costly compliance burdens or otherwise increase our costs, potentially impacting our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services. The complexity of regulatory changes could lead to new or different criteria for participation in and access to our payments system by financial institutions or other customers. Moreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, civil damages, or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is crucial. The payments industry is characterized by rapid technological change, which can impact our business in several ways, including the development of new technologies that may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use. Our ability to adapt to these changes is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and competitive advantage. We rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations, and access to capital to fund our global operations and manage risks associated with settlement failures by our customers. Our business continuity program analyzes risks, assesses potential impacts, and develops effective response strategies to ensure operational continuity. Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and increase our costs. The evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates ongoing investment in protective measures to safeguard our systems and operations. Our relationships with financial institution customers are critical to our success, and losing a significant portion of business from these customers could lead to substantial revenue decreases. Additionally, our efforts to effect change in regulatory environments may not succeed, which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase revenues. The focus of merchants on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings, increasing our incentive program costs and potentially impacting profitability. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our operational capabilities and resilience in the face of external pressures and market volatility. We must also navigate the complexities of working with governments, which can expose us to unique risks that may materially impact our business. The need for effective risk management strategies is paramount to mitigate the adverse effects of economic and political events on our operations. Our organizational resilience is tested by the demands of a rapidly changing competitive landscape, and our ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes is essential for survival and growth.

We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations, financial results, or stock price, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business. Our business can be adversely affected by the general environment, including economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments, which all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but violations could occur. Our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to these systems. System interruptions, errors, or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including technological failure, changes to our systems, and power failures, and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our business and operations could be negatively impacted by business or system interruptions, errors, or downtime, which could arise from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, and similar events. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident, we maintain a backup and recovery infrastructure, including facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans. We continuously monitor our systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement, and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We have established policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, using periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Our risk management process includes risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation. The board of directors has approved an enterprise risk management framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization. We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. Our operational risk management policies and governance processes include oversight of operational risk management, fraud, data, information security, model governance, and third-party risk. We also face compliance risk, which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines, or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Our compliance risk management includes policies, procedures, and controls designed to achieve and monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. We have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both normal and stressed conditions. Our capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, maintaining a well-capitalized status even in stressed scenarios.

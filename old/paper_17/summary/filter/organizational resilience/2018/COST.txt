The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly due to our dependence on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on these markets, and any substantial slowing or sustained decline could adversely affect our results. We may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing and new markets, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We face challenges in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with local preferences and competition with established operators. Disruptions in our merchandise distribution or processing could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction, and we rely on the orderly operation of our supply chain. Our success depends on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences, and failure to do so could negatively affect our market share. We extensively rely on information technology, and any failure or disruption of our systems could adversely affect our operations. We are currently making investments to improve our critical information systems, and failure to implement these effectively could harm our business. We identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls, which could adversely impact our financial reporting. Our ability to maintain effective internal control is critical to our operational integrity. We must also manage the privacy and security of personal and business information, as breaches could damage our reputation and incur substantial costs. We face payment-related risks, including the potential for increased fraud losses as we offer new payment options. Our operations are subject to various risks, including health-related issues that could disrupt our supply chain and affect consumer confidence. Natural disasters could negatively impact our operations, leading to physical damage and disruption in product supply. Climate change factors may also adversely affect our ability to procure needed commodities. We are subject to strong competition, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. General economic factors, including inflation and unemployment, may impact demand for our products and services. Our international operations expose us to legislative and regulatory risks that could adversely affect our business. We must adapt to changes in accounting standards, and failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in significant costs. Our business requires compliance with numerous laws, and failure to achieve compliance could lead to lawsuits and other proceedings that negatively affect our operations. We believe that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, but we face risks associated with our self-insurance liabilities and the unpredictability of claims costs. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, and changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

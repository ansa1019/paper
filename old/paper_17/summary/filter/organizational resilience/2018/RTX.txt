Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be impacted by various factors, including global economic, capital market, and political conditions, which may affect our ability to maintain operational continuity and resilience under challenging circumstances. Tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing, potentially impacting our operational flexibility and resource deployment. Our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries, which are influenced by external factors such as fluctuations in economic activity, regulatory changes, and geopolitical risks. A slowdown in these industries can adversely affect our performance and ability to adapt to market demands. The financial performance of our aerospace businesses is directly tied to economic conditions, and any significant changes could result in reduced sales and margins, impacting our competitive position. Our international operations expose us to economic risks, including fluctuations in foreign currency and changes in local government regulations, which can affect our ability to respond effectively to market pressures and maintain organizational health. We engage in acquisitions and divestitures to enhance our strategic initiatives, but these transactions may present challenges that could disrupt our operations and hinder our ability to realize anticipated benefits. The integration of acquired businesses may divert management's attention and impact employee morale, which are critical for maintaining organizational resilience. Our ability to manage costs and achieve efficiencies through restructuring plans is essential for sustaining performance under pressure. Cyber-attacks on our information technology infrastructure pose significant risks that could disrupt our operations and compromise our ability to deliver products and services. We continue to invest in enhancing our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities to mitigate these risks. Our reliance on suppliers and the potential for disruptions in the supply chain could adversely affect our ability to meet customer commitments and maintain operational effectiveness. The evolving nature of regulatory compliance, particularly in relation to cybersecurity and environmental matters, necessitates ongoing adjustments to our operational practices to ensure resilience against legal and compliance risks. Our strategic response to these challenges involves continuous assessment of risks and the implementation of proactive measures to safeguard our competitive position and ensure long-term sustainability. The anticipated separation transactions may also impact our operational and financial profiles, making us more vulnerable to market fluctuations and requiring us to adapt our strategies accordingly. Overall, our capacity to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical for our survival and growth in a dynamic business environment.

This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any provisions of healthcare legislation, which could have a significant effect on our business. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of our products, and failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may adversely affect our operational continuity. We may experience loss of market share, additional expense, and harm to our reputation due to interruptions in manufacturing operations, which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand. Our reliance on certain suppliers exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices, which may impact our operational flexibility. We are subject to cost containment measures resulting in pricing pressures, which could affect our competitive advantage in the market. Our international operations are subject to additional risks, including political and economic instability, which could adversely impact our ability to manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions, and the risks associated with integrating new businesses could adversely affect our organizational effectiveness. We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business, and a failure of these systems or a breach of information security could expose us to reputational and business harm. We are in the process of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and any disruptions or deficiencies in this implementation could adversely affect our operations. Our ability to attract and retain key employees is critical to achieving our strategic business objectives, and failure to do so may hinder our organizational resilience. We have made investments seeking to address cybersecurity threats, but the evolving nature of these threats poses potential risks to the security of our IT systems and data. Our financial condition reflects our ability to generate substantial cash from operations, which supports our strategic initiatives and operational needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from various sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. We have a borrowing capacity available under our main credit facility, which we may utilize to support future growth and operational requirements. Our management believes that our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to access capital markets at competitive rates. We review our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, and while the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We are involved in various ongoing legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, and the outcomes of these matters could result in significant claims and settlements that may adversely affect our financial condition.

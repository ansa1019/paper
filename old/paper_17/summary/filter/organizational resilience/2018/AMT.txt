A significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand. Factors that may affect such demand include increased mergers or consolidations that reduce the number of wireless service providers or use of network sharing among governments or wireless service providers. Our business is subject to government and tax regulations, and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape. Our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are terminated or not renewed. We may experience disputes with our tenants, which could lead to a termination of our leases or a deterioration in our relationships with those tenants, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. The financial condition of wireless service providers and their ability to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure is crucial for our operational flexibility. Our expansion initiatives involve risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets, which could disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk. We depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants, and if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under their agreements with us, our revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to economic, political, and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position. We face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect our ability to plan, forecast, and budget for our international operations. Our revenues earned from international operations are primarily denominated in local currencies, and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues and operating profits. We also face risks associated with the loss of key personnel in markets where talent is difficult to acquire. Our towers, fiber networks, data centers, or computer systems may be affected by natural disasters, security breaches, and other unforeseen events, which could impact our ability to provide services to our tenants and lead to tenant loss. Although we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters and cybersecurity, we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction of sites for a major future event. Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, and noncompliance could result in significant fines or penalties. We may also be liable for substantial costs of investigation, removal, or remediation of contaminated sites. Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities depends on maintaining recurring revenue and converting it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and achieving operational efficiencies. Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities, and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. The majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, and a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations is recurring revenue that we expect to continue receiving in future periods.

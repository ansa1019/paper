The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Strategic risks may arise from general or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The retail business is rapidly evolving, and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping digitally. Our strategy includes acquisitions, joint ventures, and investments in ecommerce, technology, and customer initiatives, which may not adequately allow us to grow our ecommerce business or maintain our overall market position. Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance, resulting in physical damage to our properties, disruption in supply chains, and changes in consumer purchasing patterns. The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We rely extensively on information systems, and disruptions could harm our ability to conduct operations. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and any breach of our security measures could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain qualified associates is critical, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our financial performance. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our international operations are subject to various risks, including political conditions, economic conditions, and legal and regulatory constraints. Changes in tax and trade laws could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We are involved in several legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our management measures the results of the company's segments using each segment's operating income and comparable sales metrics. We focus on strong, efficient growth, consistent operating discipline, and strategic capital allocation to improve returns on capital over time. Our objective is to prioritize strong, efficient growth by focusing on the most productive growth opportunities and increasing comparable store and club sales. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity and manage inventory. Our total revenues increased, driven by positive comparable sales and ecommerce growth, although we faced challenges from club closures and currency fluctuations. Our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased, primarily due to strong sales performance and productivity improvements. We continue to allocate capital to ecommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels while slowing the rate of new store openings. Our liquidity is supported by cash flows provided by operating activities, long-term debt, and short-term borrowings, which are sufficient to fund operations and investments. We maintain strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings, enabling us to refinance our debt at favorable rates. Our contractual obligations include capital lease and financing obligations, non-cancelable operating leases, and purchase obligations, which are significant for our operational management. We continuously assess our accounting estimates and judgments to ensure accurate financial reporting, including the evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment and the accounting for business combinations.

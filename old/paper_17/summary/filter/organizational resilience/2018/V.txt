As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations, which could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules and require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, and we continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. The evolving regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services, which could harm our competitive positioning. Increased regulation of the global payments industry could harm our business and may require us to allow other payments networks to support Visa products or services. Our ability to adapt to regulatory changes is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring business continuity. We depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties, which are essential for sustaining our operations and expanding our acceptance. Our success increasingly depends on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships, as disruptions could lead to negative experiences for account holders or others using Visa-branded payment products. We face intense competition in our industry, and our products compete with various payment methods, including cash and checks. The competitive landscape is evolving rapidly, and we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses, products, services, and practices. Our financial institution clients and merchants can reassess their commitments to us at any time, which could harm our business and financial condition. Our revenues and profits are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain, and maintain. We may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume, adapt to regulatory changes, and expand their use and acceptance of Visa products and services. Our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders, and legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or future enforcement actions could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business. We are also subject to litigation risks, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Our ability to recover from setbacks, such as regulatory changes or litigation outcomes, is essential for maintaining organizational resilience. We must continuously assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance and current economic conditions. Our strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our operational capabilities and ensure we can effectively respond to external pressures and disruptions. The management of our liquidity and capital resources is critical to our ability to navigate complex and turbulent market conditions, ensuring we can meet our operational needs and support our growth objectives.

In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks that could affect our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition, including risks inherent in the financial services industry and those specific to our operations. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, enabling us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management, which includes identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling risks, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational, and reputational risks. We continuously update our systems to support our operations and growth, which entails significant costs and risks associated with implementing new systems. Our operational and security systems infrastructure, including our computer systems and data management, are integral to our performance, and disruptions to these systems could adversely impact our ability to process transactions or provide services. 

We have developed and maintain contingency plans designed to prepare us to respond to potential adverse economic, financial, or market stress. These plans include our capital contingency plan and financial contingency and recovery plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions, and routines to enable us to increase capital and access funding sources during periods of stress. Our liquidity risk management objectives aim to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. We analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintaining liquidity and access to diverse funding sources.

Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan, and liquidity requirements, specifically addressing strategic risks. We assess the risk-adjusted returns of each business and monitor business performance throughout the year, providing the board with regular progress reports on strategic objectives and timelines. We utilize various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures, which are subject to inherent limitations. In times of market stress or unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, potentially limiting the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and causing significant losses.

We continuously monitor our balance sheet position to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. Our risk management processes require strong practices integrated into key strategic, capital, and financial planning processes. Our risk framework establishes clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability for risk management, promoting a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization. We also have established protocols to govern conduct risk, which could result in harm to the corporation, shareholders, or customers. 

We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of borrowers or counterparties, utilizing statistical techniques and historical experience to inform our credit decisions. Our commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed to ensure concentrations of credit exposure remain aligned with our risk appetite. We also monitor and manage operational risk, which may occur anywhere in the corporation and is not limited to operations functions. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization, and we have taken measures to implement training, procedures, and backup systems to support our operations.

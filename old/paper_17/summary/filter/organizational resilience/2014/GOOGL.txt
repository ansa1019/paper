Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including intense competition and the need to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users. Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to rapidly deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace and adapt to changing user needs. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology, market trends, and consumer needs. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development to enhance our search technology and existing products and services, and introduce new offerings that meet user expectations. Our ongoing investment in new businesses and products is inherently risky and could disrupt our ongoing operations. We face challenges in adapting our products and services to new devices and platforms, which could affect our ability to capture opportunities in a dynamic, multi-screen environment. Our business depends on a strong brand, and maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical for our success. We are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business, and any legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us due to legal costs and diversion of management resources. Acquisitions are an important element of our corporate strategy, but they could result in operating difficulties and other consequences that may adversely impact our business. Our employees are critical to our success, and we expect to continue investing in them to foster innovation and maintain our corporate culture. Our international operations expose us to additional risks, including changes in local political, economic, and regulatory conditions that may adversely harm our business. We are also subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which can impact our revenues and earnings. Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, and competition for qualified employees is intense. We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, including potential quality issues and supply shortages that could negatively impact our operations. Our products and services are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various external threats, and we must ensure the integrity and performance of our information technology and communication systems. We experience cyber attacks regularly, and any breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and loss of confidence in our products and services. Our ability to manage these risks effectively is critical to maintaining operational continuity and achieving our strategic objectives. We continuously evaluate the impact of external pressures and internal capabilities on our organizational resilience, ensuring that we can adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing business environment.

International, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies could significantly impair the company's profitability and growth prospects. Restricted access to global markets impairs the company's ability to export goods and services and limits access to raw materials and high-quality parts at competitive prices. Trade restrictions could limit the company's ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair its ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products, and services. Furthermore, the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to the company's customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural commodities, resulting in a corresponding negative effect on demand for agricultural equipment.

The company’s business results depend largely on its ability to understand its customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer demand. The company's ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers' anticipated preferences is critical to its success. The company may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for equipment. Changes in the availability and price of raw materials could result in production disruptions or increased costs. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, or natural disaster events could affect the company's operations and profitability. The company relies on suppliers to acquire necessary materials, and certain components are available from a single supplier, which presents risks. The company's operations are subject to interest rate risks, which can reduce demand for equipment and adversely affect interest margins. Negative economic conditions can materially weaken demand for the company's equipment and services, limit access to funding, and result in higher funding costs. Sustained negative economic conditions can affect housing starts and other construction activities, dampening demand for construction equipment. The company’s financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of sales and could be impacted materially by negative economic conditions affecting the financial industry. The occurrence of security breaches and other disruptions to the company's information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations and compromise sensitive information. The company may incur increased costs due to new greenhouse gas emission standards and could be impacted by physical effects attributed to climate change on its facilities, suppliers, and customers. The potential physical impacts of climate change on the company's operations are highly uncertain and may adversely impact demand for products and financial performance. The company maintains defined benefit pension plans, which impose funding obligations that could adversely affect its financial condition. The reallocation of radio frequency spectrums could disrupt the reliability of the company's technology solutions, negatively affecting customer profitability.

Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. We are subject to social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries, which include difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, differing employment practices, and local cultural factors. Our global growth subjects us to risks associated with funding increasing headcount and integrating new offices, which necessitates effective controls and procedures to regulate operations and monitor compliance with regulations. If we are unable to manage these risks or operational fluctuations, our business and financial condition could be harmed. Disruptions in global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting our ability to make principal and interest payments on debt or refinance any outstanding debt. We are exposed to general economic conditions and events that affect the markets in which we own properties, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Significant expenditures associated with real estate investments are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from those investments, which may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic conditions. Our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector, and our operating results depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers. We may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our cash flow. We face risks associated with acquiring properties, including the risk that acquired properties will not perform as anticipated. Our real estate development strategies may not be successful, and we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms. We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses affecting our operating results and cash flow. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities and available financing sources is considered adequate to meet anticipated future requirements. However, we may need to find alternative ways to increase liquidity, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms is dependent on various factors, including market conditions and our financial position. We are dependent on external sources of capital, and our ability to maintain our REIT status requires us to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income, which may necessitate short-term borrowing. We are also exposed to potential impacts of future climate change and climate-related risks, which may affect our operations. Our systems are vulnerable to damages from various sources, including cyber security attacks, which could result in material disruptions to our business. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition and competitive position. We believe our properties are adequately insured against certain risks, but there are certain losses that are not fully insured, which could result in significant capital loss and affect our future revenues. The presence of hazardous substances on our properties could adversely affect our ability to lease or sell those properties, impacting our cash flow. Our organizational practices and strategic initiatives are designed to address these risks and enhance our operational resilience, enabling us to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain performance under pressure.

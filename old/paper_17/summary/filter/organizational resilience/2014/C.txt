Despite these challenges, Citi made progress on execution priorities, including efficient resource allocation and disciplined expense management, which involved simplifying and streamlining the organization to improve productivity. Strategic actions were announced to exit consumer businesses in certain international markets to focus on areas with greater scale and growth potential. The wind down of Citi Holdings included a reduction of assets by $19 billion, or 16%, from year-end 2013. Citi's ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations was emphasized, particularly in light of regulatory changes and requirements that continue to create uncertainties. The operating environment in 2015 is expected to remain challenging, with the U.S. economy being susceptible to global events and volatility, and the economic situations of several European countries remaining fragile. The frequency and severity of legal and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have increased, alongside a rise in cybersecurity attacks targeting financial institutions. While Citi may not fully control these factors, it remains committed to its execution priorities and achieving its financial targets. The report highlights the importance of maintaining organizational health and resilience through strategic initiatives and resource management, particularly in response to external pressures and disruptive events. The focus on operational flexibility and adaptability is evident in the ongoing efforts to manage risks and uncertainties, including the impact of geopolitical tensions and market volatility. Citi's strategic response mechanisms are designed to enhance organizational resilience, ensuring continued functioning and performance under pressure. The emphasis on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration reflects a systemic perspective on resilience, as Citi navigates complex situations and prepares for future challenges. The report underscores the multifaceted nature of organizational resilience, encompassing aspects such as resource generation, risk assessment, and the ability to foresee and confront adversity. Overall, Citi's strategic adaptation and proactive measures are aimed at sustaining performance and achieving long-term organizational success amidst a turbulent business environment.

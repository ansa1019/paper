The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Global and domestic economic risks and consumer demand risks may materially adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, inflation, and changes in consumer spending patterns could lead to a slowdown in discretionary purchases, affecting our operational flexibility and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. Our ability to identify and respond to consumer trends is critical; failure to do so may negatively impact our market share and customer relationships. Disruptions in our information systems could harm our ability to run our business, and any material interruption may have a material adverse effect on our operations. We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business, and disruptions could affect our performance under pressure. Our expansion strategy depends on our ability to execute retail concepts in new markets and to locate, hire, and retain qualified personnel. Local regulations and increased costs could limit our growth opportunities, affecting our operational continuity and strategic initiatives. Our Walmart International segment faces risks associated with legislative, judicial, and regulatory conditions that could adversely affect our business performance. Natural disasters and geo-political events could disrupt our operations, leading to significant financial impacts. The occurrence of such events could result in physical damage to properties, closure of stores, and disruption in supply chains, which may impede our recovery efforts and ability to maintain performance. Our ability to attract and retain qualified associates is essential for operational success, and increases in labor costs could adversely affect our financial performance. We face strong competition from other retailers, and our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures is crucial for maintaining our market position. Our reliance on suppliers introduces risks related to product safety and availability, which could affect customer confidence and our financial performance. We maintain substantial security measures to protect sensitive information; however, cyber threats are evolving, and any breach could materially adversely affect our operations and reputation. We are subject to various legal proceedings that may materially affect our financial condition, and ongoing investigations could result in significant costs and adverse consequences. The complexities of managing international operations and compliance with local laws present additional challenges that could impact our performance. The various risks inherent in doing business, including economic volatility and environmental disruptions, necessitate a robust strategic response to ensure organizational resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment.

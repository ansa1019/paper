The risks described indicate that our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by economic conditions, which may lead to long-lasting changes in consumer discretionary purchasing behavior. Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands, and failure to preserve this value could negatively impact our financial results. The quality of products and services delivered by our business partners is crucial, as any erosion of consumer trust due to breaches of privacy or food safety issues could significantly reduce brand value. The unauthorized access or destruction of customer or employee data could impact our reputation and expose us to potential liability. We continue to invest in technology and personnel to anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks, recognizing that security measures cannot guarantee success in preventing breaches. Incidents involving food safety could harm our business, leading to negative publicity and potential litigation. Our ability to implement strategic initiatives effectively is critical for growth, and factors such as construction cost increases or delays in store openings could adversely affect our financial results. We face intense competition in all markets, which could lead to reduced profitability and hinder growth. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, and any slowdown in revenue trends could adversely affect our overall financial results. Additionally, our future growth increasingly depends on the success of our international operating segments, which may face unique challenges such as economic downturns and regulatory compliance. The performance of our international operations may also be affected by local market conditions and the ability of our partners to expand. We are exposed to commodity price risks, particularly related to high-quality arabica coffee beans, and increases in costs could adversely impact profitability. Our financial condition is sensitive to various factors, including labor costs, litigation outcomes, and external pressures such as political instability and natural disasters. Interruptions in our supply chain could negatively impact our ability to deliver products, and we rely on a variety of business partners to maintain quality and compliance. Failure to meet market expectations for financial performance could lead to volatility in our stock price. The loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business, and we must continue to recruit and retain qualified employees to support our strategic initiatives. We rely heavily on information technology, and any failures in these systems could harm our operations and financial results. Our policies are designed to comply with applicable laws, and failure to do so could result in litigation and increased costs. We actively manage our cash and investments to fund operating needs and support growth initiatives, including potential acquisitions. Our ability to generate cash flows from operations is expected to be sufficient to finance capital requirements and shareholder distributions. We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to satisfy domestic liquidity needs.

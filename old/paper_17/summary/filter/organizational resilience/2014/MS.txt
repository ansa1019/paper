Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio owned by the company. The company's results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global and economic conditions and other factors. The company is exposed to various risks, including operational risk, which refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, and systems or from external events. The company incurs operational risk across its business activities, including revenue-generating activities and control groups. The effectiveness of the company's risk management policies is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and mitigating risks associated with adverse conditions. The company has established a comprehensive risk management framework to identify, measure, monitor, and control risks, which is essential for maintaining organizational health and resilience. 

The company's operational risk management framework includes business continuity management, which is responsible for identifying key risks and threats to the company's resiliency and ensuring that recovery strategies and resources are in place for the resumption of critical business functions following a disaster or other business interruption. The company has implemented disaster recovery plans and maintains an information security program to protect its information assets against unauthorized disclosure and other risks. The company's operational risk department provides oversight of operational risk management and independently assesses, measures, and monitors operational risk. 

The company actively manages its liquidity and capital position, which is vital for resilience under challenging conditions. The liquidity risk management framework is designed to ensure that the company has access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions, supporting the execution of business strategies. The company has established a contingency funding plan that anticipates periods of limited access to funding and conducts liquidity stress tests to model liquidity outflows across multiple scenarios. 

The company's risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk. The company recognizes that severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and could result in significant losses. The company is subject to extensive regulation, which is undergoing major changes that will impact its business, and it must adapt to these changes to maintain its competitive advantage. 

The companyâ€™s operational flexibility and adaptability are critical for navigating environmental perturbations and unexpected situations. The company is committed to continuous improvement in its risk management processes and has established a culture of effective risk management that is essential for organizational resilience. The company's operational risk framework is continually evolving to account for changes in the regulatory and business environment, ensuring that it can effectively respond to challenges and maintain performance under pressure.

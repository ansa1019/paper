This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Our business is subject to various pressures, including employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events, and international operations. We are required to obtain regulatory approval before we can manufacture, market, and sell our products, and failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and judicially imposed sanctions. The regulatory environment is increasingly complex, and changes in laws or regulations could materially affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products. We continuously assess risks associated with our clinical trials and product candidates, including the adequacy of endpoints selected for approval and the potential need for additional studies. Our ability to successfully develop and commercialize products is contingent upon our operational flexibility and adaptability to changing market conditions. We face significant competition from biosimilars and other therapeutic products, which necessitates a strategic response to maintain our competitive advantage. Our restructuring plan aims to improve our cost structure while investing in innovation and operational efficiencies. We are also focused on enhancing our organizational capabilities to better respond to external pressures and disruptions. The complexity of our operations requires effective resource allocation and management to ensure business continuity and operational resilience. We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, which are vulnerable to cyber-attacks that could impact our operational integrity. Global economic conditions may negatively affect our business, leading to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that could reduce demand for our products. Our reliance on third-party suppliers and partners introduces additional risks that could disrupt our operations. We must effectively manage these relationships to ensure the timely supply of products and services. Our financial condition and liquidity are influenced by the timing of payments from customers, which can be affected by economic stability in various regions. The successful execution of our strategic initiatives is critical to our long-term growth and resilience in a competitive landscape. We continue to monitor and adapt to changes in the healthcare environment, including reimbursement pressures and evolving treatment protocols. Our commitment to maintaining operational continuity and organizational health is essential for navigating the challenges posed by regulatory scrutiny and market volatility. We recognize that our future success depends on our ability to innovate, adapt, and respond effectively to both internal and external challenges while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.

In evaluating our business, we recognize that our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is critical. The risks associated with operating as a REIT may impact our organizational resilience, as failure to qualify could lead to substantial corporate tax liabilities, reducing cash available for operations and distributions. Our operational flexibility is essential in mitigating risks related to resource allocation and capital expenditures, particularly in the context of our REIT conversion. We must adapt to external pressures, including changes in tax laws and economic conditions, which may affect our ability to sustain profitability and operational continuity. The complexity of our financial structure, including significant debt obligations, may limit our flexibility to respond to market changes and could increase our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions. Our strategic initiatives focus on maintaining a balanced customer base, which is vital for generating interconnection revenues and enhancing our competitive advantage. The long sales cycle for our offerings may hinder our responsiveness to customer needs and market demands, impacting our overall performance. Additionally, our reliance on third-party providers for internet connectivity introduces risks that could disrupt our operations and affect customer confidence. We are committed to investing in our back-office systems to enhance operational effectiveness, although these projects may introduce temporary disruptions. Our organizational practices emphasize the importance of knowledge management and internal collaboration to foster resilience against unexpected situations. The need for continuous adaptation and innovation is underscored by our expansion activities, which require careful assessment of market conditions and resource deployment. We are also aware of the potential impacts of environmental disruptions and operational hazards on our business continuity. Our ability to recover from crises and maintain service levels is paramount, and we must ensure that our infrastructure is resilient to extreme conditions. The ongoing evaluation of our operational resources and strategic response mechanisms will be critical in navigating future uncertainties. Our commitment to organizational health is reflected in our focus on employee development and retention, which are essential for sustaining our growth trajectory. As we confront the challenges posed by a turbulent market environment, our future planning will involve proactive measures to enhance our resilience strategies. We recognize that the interconnectedness of our operations across various regions requires a systemic perspective to effectively manage risks and capitalize on opportunities for growth. The evolving nature of our industry necessitates that we remain agile and responsive to changes, ensuring that we can thrive amidst complexity and uncertainty.

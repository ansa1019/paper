Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The acquisition of LSI and the integration of its business, operations, and employees involves risks, and failure to integrate successfully may adversely affect our future results. Our ability to realize benefits from this acquisition depends on timely integration and consolidation of organizations, operations, and technologies, as well as harmonization of business cultures. Integration will be complex and time-consuming, potentially disrupting our business and diverting management's attention. The challenges include preserving important relationships, improving operating margins, integrating financial controls, and managing employee morale during transitions. We may be unable to successfully manage the performance of transitioning employees. The anticipated benefits of the acquisition are based on projections that may be inaccurate, and we may be exposed to unexpected contingencies or liabilities. Our growth strategy and future profitability could be affected if we do not realize these benefits. Adverse global economic conditions could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as they may cause customers to reduce or delay spending, leading to reduced demand for our products. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, characterized by rapid technological change and fluctuations in product supply and demand, which can cause significant downturns in our business. Our dependence on a small number of markets, particularly in mobile handsets, exposes us to volatility and risks associated with customer concentration, which increases the risk of fluctuations in operating results. We face intense competition in our industry, which can prevent us from growing revenue and raising prices to offset increases in costs. Our ability to compete successfully depends on various factors, including our capacity to innovate and respond to changes in market conditions. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and manage our supply chain effectively. We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing model, which makes us vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain. A prolonged disruption at our manufacturing or research facilities could materially affect our ability to meet customer demands and delay new product development. We are also subject to various governmental regulations, and failure to comply could result in significant expenses and operational limitations. Our research and development investments are critical to maintaining competitiveness, and unsuccessful investments could adversely affect our financial condition. Our success depends on retaining qualified personnel, particularly in design and technical roles, as their loss could materially impact our business. We are subject to various legal and regulatory risks, including potential claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, which could result in significant expenses and harm our relationships with customers. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by employee-benefit-related costs and expenses, particularly in light of our pension obligations. The complexity of our products could lead to unforeseen delays or defects, adversely affecting market acceptance and our reputation. We continuously review our supply chain and may seek to qualify second-source manufacturers to mitigate risks associated with reliance on single suppliers.

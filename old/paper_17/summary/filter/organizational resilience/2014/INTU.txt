This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our expectations and beliefs regarding future conduct and growth of the business, including our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products, services, and business models. We face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results, and our competitors may introduce superior products and services, which necessitates our ongoing investment in product development, marketing, and sales capabilities. Our future growth depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen these relationships. As we transition to more connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems is becoming increasingly important. Business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities. Our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, human error, malicious attacks, and other events beyond our control, which could materially harm our business. We rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors, and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders and handle customer service requests. Any interruption or failure of these systems may prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause data to be unintentionally disclosed. We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory inquiries that may result in significant costs and divert management's attention. Our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets, and drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop. We regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms, and if these investments do not succeed, or if delays disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed. Our international operations are subject to increased risks, including trade barriers, difficulties in managing foreign operations, and compliance with foreign laws. We assess the need for adjustments to our financial estimates and reserves based on changes in facts or circumstances, which may impact our financial position and results of operations. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands, and damage to our reputation may reduce demand for our products and services. We are committed to maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of external pressures and challenges, ensuring our ability to adapt and respond effectively to changing market conditions and customer needs.

The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including disruptions in our depot operations which could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction. We depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, and unforeseen disruptions in operations due to catastrophic events may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business, and any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are currently making significant technology investments to improve our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business, and the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. Our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors, including regulatory changes and prevailing wage rates, which may affect our operational flexibility. Our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing and new markets, could be adversely impacted by our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses, which is dependent on local land use regulations and community actions. We face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, necessitating effective responses to competitive pressures and changes in member expectations. General economic factors may adversely affect demand for our products and services, requiring us to adapt our business strategies accordingly. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our operations and financial performance, potentially disrupting the supply of products and requiring us to suspend operations. We must also navigate risks associated with international operations, including political conditions and regulatory constraints, which could adversely affect our business. Our financial performance is influenced by our ability to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition, which is essential to our business model. Disruptions in our operations or failure to meet market expectations for financial performance could adversely affect our reputation and member trust. We must effectively identify and respond to consumer trends to maintain our market share and relationship with our members. Our investments in technology and operational management are critical for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring business continuity. We must also manage risks related to product safety and compliance with environmental regulations, as failures in these areas could lead to reputational damage and legal liabilities. Our ability to attract, train, and retain highly qualified employees is essential for operational effectiveness, and any difficulties in this area could adversely impact our business. The evolving landscape of multichannel retailing requires us to keep pace with changing member expectations, and failure to do so could negatively affect our results of operations. Overall, our resilience strategies must encompass effective risk management, adaptability to external pressures, and a commitment to maintaining operational continuity under challenging conditions.

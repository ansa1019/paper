Our business and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial performance, and travel demand. The ability of consumers to travel across international borders has been significantly impacted by various travel restrictions, and we do not expect economic and operating conditions for our business to recover fully until there is widespread consumer confidence and ability to travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes to our accommodation room nights trends, and the extent of these effects on our business and growth prospects is highly uncertain. We believe that as vaccines and other medical interventions become widespread globally, people will increasingly feel it is safe to travel again, although the timing remains uncertain. Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, and if we are unable to retain or motivate key employees, our business would be harmed. The competition for well-qualified employees has intensified, and our personnel expenses to attract and retain key talent are increasing, which may adversely affect our results of operations. We face risks related to the growth rate and global expansion of our business, and our long-term strategy involves continued expansion throughout the world, subject to associated risks typical of international businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk that our travel service provider and restaurant partners may declare bankruptcy or cease operations, which could harm our business and results of operations. We are also subject to risks associated with the facilitation of payments from consumers, including risks related to fraud and compliance with evolving rules and regulations. Our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and market conditions is critical, as the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards. We are working toward enhancing our payments capabilities, including offering alternative payment solutions to consumers, which is essential for our growth in certain markets. The uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior complicates our ability to effectively manage our business and forecast our financial and operational performance. We are reliant on a global supply chain of third-party service providers, and any damage to or interruption in these services could materially adversely affect our business. We have taken steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems, but these measures are expensive and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime. Our marketing efficiency is impacted by various factors, including the effectiveness of our marketing channels and consumer behavior, which can fluctuate significantly. We are also subject to various competition and consumer protection laws, and increased regulatory focus on our industry could result in additional compliance costs or adversely affect our business. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for a long recovery period for the travel industry may continue to create operational and workplace cultural challenges that could adversely affect our business. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brands worldwide and to offer other travel and travel-related services while managing the complexities and uncertainties inherent in our business environment.

Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including risks related to our global operations, which expose us to social, political, and economic challenges. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the U.S., and difficulties in managing international operations may impact our ability to adapt and respond to local conditions. Disruptions in global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting our ability to make principal and interest payments or refinance outstanding debt. The depreciation in foreign currency values where we have significant investments can materially affect our financial position and results of operations. We attempt to mitigate risks through strategies such as borrowing in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against currency fluctuations. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, which may expose us to economic downturns in that sector, and we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification and market research. Our operating performance is influenced by local economic conditions, and adverse changes in these conditions could impact our overall business. We are also subject to risks associated with the acquisition of properties, including the potential for performance shortfalls and the inability to integrate operations effectively. Our real estate development and redevelopment strategies may face challenges, including obtaining necessary permits and managing construction costs, which can exceed estimates. We are exposed to various environmental risks that could result in unanticipated losses, and compliance with environmental regulations may require significant expenditures. Our ability to generate cash from operations and access financing is crucial for meeting our anticipated future development and operational needs. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has introduced uncertainty, potentially disrupting our business and impacting our ability to recover investments in real estate assets. System failures or cybersecurity attacks pose additional risks that could disrupt our operations and result in financial losses. We depend on the expertise of our executive officers and key employees, and any loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. Our ability to manage and respond to these risks is critical for maintaining operational continuity and organizational resilience. We continuously evaluate our financial condition and operating results to adapt to changing market conditions and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Our strategic initiatives include maintaining sufficient liquidity and managing our investments in co-investment ventures, which may involve risks associated with market conditions and the performance of underlying assets. The potential impacts of climate change and the need for compliance with stricter regulations may also affect our business operations and financial condition.

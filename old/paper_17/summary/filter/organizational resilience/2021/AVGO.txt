Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted normal business activity and may continue to impact our organizational health and operational continuity. The pandemic has resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays, which could recur in the event of future disruptions. We have modified our workplace practices globally, resulting in many employees working remotely, which may reduce efficiency and productivity, potentially causing product development delays and hampering service innovation. Our dependence on a small number of significant customers increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and sensitivity to adverse developments. We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing model, relying on contract manufacturers and suppliers, which may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity. Disruptions in our supply chain, including those caused by geopolitical tensions and environmental disturbances, could materially harm our business and customer relationships. The complexity of our products and the rapid technological changes in the semiconductor industry require us to adapt continuously, and failure to do so may impair our competitive advantage. We face risks associated with compliance with various governmental regulations, which may require significant expenditures and could restrict our operations if we fail to maintain compliance. The ongoing uncertainties in the global economic environment make it challenging to accurately forecast revenue and could negatively affect our financial condition and liquidity. Our ability to manage working capital effectively and respond to changes in customer demand is critical for maintaining operational flexibility. We have experienced fluctuations in our operating results due to various factors, including the timing of customer orders and the shift to cloud-based IT solutions, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of sales. Our strategic initiatives include pursuing acquisitions and investments to enhance our market coverage and technological capabilities, but these involve risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations. We also recognize the importance of effective succession planning and the retention of qualified personnel to execute our business strategy effectively. Our organizational resilience is tested by the need to adapt to changing market conditions and customer demands, which requires ongoing investment in research and development to ensure our products remain competitive. The potential for significant liabilities arising from warranty and product liability claims could adversely affect our financial condition. We must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand, and any failure to do so could harm our relationships with customers and our overall business performance. The ongoing pandemic has necessitated a reevaluation of our operational practices, and we continue to monitor its implications on our business, customers, and suppliers. Our ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes is essential for our survival and growth in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market landscape.

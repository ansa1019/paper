The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In response to the pandemic, we implemented new practices and protocols in our operations, including enhanced cleaning protocols and additional health and safety measures, which resulted in increased expenses while potentially impacting sales opportunities. The pandemic has required us to make decisions that may be considered controversial about precautionary measures, which could impact our brand reputation and associate retention. Market conditions and the pandemic's impact on the global economy and supply chain have also affected the financial viability of some of our suppliers and logistics providers, interrupting and increasing costs for our supply chain. Our ability to allocate, deliver, and maintain our preferred mix and level of inventory has been impacted by temporary store closures and global supply chain disruptions. The ongoing pandemic has affected execution of our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management. Failure to identify consumer trends and preferences could negatively impact our performance, as our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand. We operate in highly competitive markets, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. The retail apparel and home fashion businesses are highly competitive, and we face risks related to our opportunistic buying strategy, which requires effective reaction to rapidly changing market opportunities. Our substantial size can make it challenging to manage complex operations effectively, increasing the risk that our systems and practices may not be implemented consistently. We are also subject to various risks related to sourcing merchandise globally, including potential disruptions in manufacturing and supply, changes in trade regulations, and compliance with product laws and regulations. Our large workforce is essential for supporting our operations, and increased labor costs put pressure on our operating expenses. The availability and skill of associates may differ across markets, and we face challenges in recruiting and retaining talent, particularly in key areas such as management and information technology. Our business depends on our information technology systems, which are targeted by cyber-attacks, and disruptions in these systems could materially impair our ability to operate. We maintain policies and controls designed to reduce the risks of data security compromises, but these controls require ongoing investment. Changes in the business landscape and the increase of remote working have the potential to increase the likelihood of system damage or disruption. Our relationships with customers and our reputation are based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and incidents that erode trust could adversely affect our reputation and business. We depend on strong cash flows from our operations to fund growth and support our financial performance. Our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented by short-term bank borrowings. The ongoing uncertainty related to the pandemic continues to impact our operations, and we must adapt to changing conditions to maintain operational continuity and resilience.

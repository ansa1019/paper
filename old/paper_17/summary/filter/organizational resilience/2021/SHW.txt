The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition, and the continuing effects remain highly unpredictable. We have made changes in our business designed to support efforts to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers, including implementing remote, alternate, and flexible work arrangements where possible. We continue to evaluate these changes and work with public health and government authorities to maintain operations and support the health of our employees, customers, and their families. The necessary measures taken have resulted in additional costs and have adversely impacted our business and financial performance. We face operational risks in connection with remote work arrangements, including cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to damage or interruption from cyber attacks and system failures. The pandemic has disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, creating significant volatility in financial markets, which may continue to adversely affect our business. We have experienced temporary disruptions and closures of some facilities and have seen shifts in consumer behaviors and preferences. While demand levels for our products have been returning to more normalized levels, our ability to predict and meet future changes in demand remains uncertain. The extent of the impact on our results of operations and ability to execute business strategies will depend on numerous evolving factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, governmental directives, and the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue operations. Adverse changes in general business and economic conditions may also affect our results, cash flow, and liquidity. Our business is sensitive to economic conditions, and adverse changes may reduce demand for our products and impair our ability to meet future changes in demand. Higher inflation rates, interest rates, and supply chain disruptions could adversely affect our ability to maintain operations and meet customer demands. The ongoing labor shortage in the construction and housing segments may also impact our sales and earnings. We have made strategic acquisitions and continue to invest in expanding our product offerings and manufacturing capacity. Our financial condition remains strong, and we expect to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. However, we cannot guarantee that we will generate the required cash flow to make necessary payments under our indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. We are exposed to market risks associated with interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity fluctuations, which may adversely affect our financial condition. We rely on information technology systems for critical business processes, and disruptions to these systems could materially impact our operations. Our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce is crucial for meeting strategic objectives, and competition for talent is intense. We continue to mitigate risks related to cybersecurity and operational continuity through investments and enhanced security measures. The company is also involved in environmental investigations and remediation activities, which may impose liabilities that could adversely affect our financial condition. We are committed to compliance with increasingly stringent environmental regulations, which may result in additional costs and impact our operations.

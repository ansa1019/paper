The company's business, results of operations, and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has prompted unprecedented measures in response, including restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures, and quarantine orders. The pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in financial markets. Disruptions experienced by component suppliers and logistical service providers have resulted in supply shortages affecting sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. The extent to which the pandemic may impact the company's operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on factors outside the company's control, including the trajectory and duration of the pandemic and the effectiveness of vaccines. The company has experienced disruptions that have affected its supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products. The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company's business. The company is subject to risks from political events, trade disputes, natural disasters, and public health issues, which can disrupt international commerce and the global economy. The reliance on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of critical components exposes the company to significant supply and pricing risks. The company has made substantial investments in research and development, which are critical to its future growth and competitive position. The company's ability to compete successfully depends on ensuring the timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies. The company must continually manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services. The company's operations are also subject to risks from information technology system failures and network disruptions, which can adversely impact business continuity. The company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access, but these measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities. The company is exposed to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies, which could materially adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The company's future performance depends on the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, and its distinctive culture is a significant driver of success. The company believes that focused investments in research and development are essential for developing new and updated products that are central to its core business strategy. The company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions, and such failures can materially adversely affect its business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. The company has established policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that violations will not occur, which could materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of its investment portfolio and credit risk on its trade accounts receivable. The company is also subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, which can be expensive and time-consuming to resolve.

Our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity can be impacted by various factors, including changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our business, supply chains, operations, and the industries in which we operate, leading to unprecedented declines in demand for commercial air travel and a significant reduction in our revenues. As a result of these developments, we experienced goodwill impairment charges, credit losses on receivables, and unfavorable contract adjustments. The pandemic has also caused disruptions in our supply chain and labor shortages, which could hinder our ability to perform on our obligations to customers and may result in increased costs. We continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19, including potential new challenges that may arise, and we expect to face uncertainties regarding the recovery of commercial air traffic capacity. Our operations are subject to various risks, including the tightening of credit in financial markets, which could adversely affect our suppliers and customers, potentially leading to decreased orders and financial distress among our suppliers. Furthermore, geopolitical risks could affect government priorities and budgets, impacting sales of defense products and services. We are leveraging the Raytheon merger to undertake strategic initiatives aimed at transforming the company and enhancing operational excellence, which includes investments in digital technologies and structural cost reduction initiatives. Our ability to adapt to changes in the business environment is critical for maintaining operational continuity and achieving our major objectives. The complexity of our operations requires effective resource allocation and management to ensure resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptions. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and implementing restructuring actions to align with market demands. Our organizational practices emphasize collaboration and innovation, which are essential for navigating turbulent markets and ensuring long-term sustainability. The successful integration of our legacy businesses post-merger is vital for realizing anticipated benefits, including synergies and operational efficiencies. We face significant competition both domestically and internationally, which necessitates a proactive approach to strategic management and adaptation to evolving market conditions. Our financial performance is closely tied to the aerospace industry, and we must remain agile in response to fluctuations in demand and external disturbances. The ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under challenging conditions is paramount for our organizational resilience.

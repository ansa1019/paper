This section describes the material risks to our business, which should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC. Our business operations, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, prospects, reputation, or credit ratings could be adversely affected by known or unknown risks or uncertainties. The negotiating power of managed care organizations and other private third-party payers has increased due to consolidation, and they increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs. Competitive product launches may erode future sales of our products, and competition from manufacturers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our branded products. Our approach to business arrangements is informed by government and industry guidance, and we face significant pricing pressures from private third-party payers and government regulations. The discovery and development of new products are necessary for the continued strength of our business, and balancing current growth with investment for future growth remains a major challenge. The costs of product development continue to be high, which may affect the sustainability of our R&D portfolio. Decisions made early in the development process can have a substantial impact on marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibilities. We operate on a global scale and could be affected by currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, and global economic conditions, including inflation and restrictive government actions. Our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful, and growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable. Government financing and economic pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets. We continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflicts that could impact our business. If trade restrictions or tariffs reduce global economic activity, potential impacts could include declining sales and increased costs. We could encounter difficulties or delays in our supply chain, product manufacturing, and distribution networks due to regulatory actions, shutdowns, or supply disruptions. We depend on third-party collaborators and service providers for multiple aspects of our drug development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities. Failure by these parties to complete activities on schedule could delay or prevent the development, approval, manufacturing, or commercialization of our products. Our reputation and promising pipeline render our medicines and vaccines prime targets for counterfeiters, posing a significant risk to patient health and safety. The pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers continues to be important to payers, governments, and patients, and we expect continued focus by the federal government on regulating pricing. The discovery and development of drugs are time-consuming, costly, and unpredictable, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. We may not be able to successfully address all comments received from regulatory authorities or obtain approval for new products and indications. The covid-19 pandemic has impacted our business, operations, and financial condition, presenting various challenges, including disruptions to supply chains and clinical trials. We are focused on maintaining the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic. Future developments could result in additional impacts on our business, operations, or financial condition.

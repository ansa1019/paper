Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which could affect our organizational resilience. We face strong competition that could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, leading to decreased market share. The highly competitive and fragmented nature of our industry requires us to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and resilience. Our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, consumer preferences, and unexpected events, such as public health issues or natural disasters, is critical to our organizational health and performance. We must manage appropriate inventory levels while providing an excellent customer experience, which involves leveraging our interconnected retail capabilities and strategic investments in our supply chain. Failure to effectively manage these factors could negatively impact demand for our products and profit margins, thereby affecting our overall resilience. 

Our investments in our interconnected retail strategy are designed to enhance customer interactions and streamline operations, but these initiatives may disrupt our operations in the near term and may not provide the anticipated benefits. We must continually assess and adjust our marketing and promotional efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape and customer expectations. A positive brand and reputation are crucial for our business success, and any damage to our brand could undermine customer trust and confidence, impacting our resilience. 

We rely heavily on information technology systems, and any failure in these systems could adversely affect our business operations. Disruptions in our supply chain, exacerbated by external pressures such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could impair our ability to meet customer demand and result in lost sales. The ongoing pandemic has introduced significant uncertainty and volatility, affecting our operational management and strategic initiatives. 

Our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly qualified associates is essential for providing excellent customer service and supporting our strategic initiatives. Labor shortages and increased market pressures could impair our ability to maintain operational continuity and resilience. Additionally, our organizational response to crises, including the pandemic, requires effective management of resources and adaptation to changing circumstances. 

We face risks related to cybersecurity threats and data privacy, which could disrupt our operations and impact our reputation. The evolving regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and cybersecurity presents additional challenges to our organizational resilience. Our ability to maintain compliance with these requirements is critical for sustaining customer trust and operational integrity. 

In summary, our organizational resilience is contingent upon effectively managing competitive pressures, adapting to changing consumer needs, maintaining operational flexibility, and ensuring the integrity of our information systems and supply chain. The interplay of these factors will determine our capacity to navigate disruptions and sustain performance under pressure.

Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected. The growth and expansion of our business and product, subscription, and support offerings places a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. Failure to manage any future growth effectively could result in increased costs, disrupt our existing end-customer relationships, reduce demand for or limit us to smaller deployments of our platform, or harm our business performance and operating results. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. Our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and subscriptions to our existing end-customers is critical, as is our ability to manage production and manufacturing-related costs, global customer service organization costs, and inventory excess and obsolescence costs. Unforeseen liabilities or write-downs may impact our operating results, and we may encounter difficulties in fulfilling our end-customers' orders due to supply chain delays or events that impact our manufacturers or their suppliers. We must continually change our products and expand our business strategy in response to changes in network infrastructure requirements, including the expanding use of cloud computing. We believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products are essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing end-customers and create demand for our new offerings. We may not be able to maintain consistent or increasing revenue or revenue growth, which could lead to volatility in the market price of our common stock. Our ability to navigate challenges, such as competition from larger, well-established companies, is crucial. We rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, and if these channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and subscriptions will be limited. Our business is also subject to various risks, including political, economic, and social instability, which could impact our operations and financial results. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these could result in reputational damage and penalties. Our corporate culture fosters innovation, teamwork, and focus on execution, which are critical for maintaining our organizational resilience. The loss of key employees or failure to manage leadership transitions could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives. We must effectively manage our international operations and associated risks to limit future growth limitations. Our operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities, and we believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future.

The following discussion of risks is designed to highlight important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations, as operational risks such as cyber attacks could adversely affect our business, including disruptions to operations and loss of sensitive information. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks require ongoing monitoring and updating, and while we have not experienced material cyber attacks to date, our preventive actions may be insufficient to mitigate the effects of a major attack in the future. Natural disasters, terrorist acts, or acts of war could also cause significant disruptions to our operations, resulting in degradation of service and significant recovery time and expenditures. Our system redundancy may be inadequate to sustain operations through all such events, and while we are implementing measures to protect our infrastructure, these may not be sufficient for all eventualities. We depend on key suppliers and vendors for critical equipment and services, and disruptions in the global supply chain could significantly impact our ability to provide products and services as requested by customers. Our dependence on key suppliers is expected to continue as we develop advanced technologies, and any failure of these suppliers to meet performance expectations could materially affect our business. Additionally, significant competition in our industries necessitates that we adapt to technological changes and consumer demands to maintain profitability. If we are unable to respond effectively to competitive challenges, we risk reduced profits and potential impairment charges. Adverse economic conditions could also impact our results, as consumers may reduce discretionary spending, affecting demand for our products and services. Changes in the regulatory framework may inhibit our ability to operate and expand, and we are subject to significant litigation, which could require substantial financial resources to resolve. Our significant debt levels may reduce our operational flexibility and make us more vulnerable to downturns in business. Increases in costs for pension and healthcare benefits could further reduce profitability. We face numerous risks that could impact our operational continuity and performance, including the need to phase out outdated technologies while introducing new offerings. Our ability to navigate these risks effectively is crucial for maintaining organizational resilience, ensuring that we can confront and adapt to disruptions while preserving our operational integrity and performance.

Conocophillips' business strategy anticipates prices will remain volatile and is designed to be resilient in lower price environments, while retaining upside during periods of higher prices. Portfolio diversification and optimization, a strong balance sheet, and disciplined capital investment have positioned the company to navigate through volatile energy cycles. The company maintains a relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship, which remains a high priority, and is committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone involved in its operations and the communities in which it operates. The company strives to conduct its business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manages risk to drive sustainable business growth. The commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship includes targeting a 5 to 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity by 2030. Conocophillips has developed a company-wide climate change action plan to track mitigation activities for each climate-related risk included in the corporate sustainable development risk register. The risks addressed in this action plan fall into four categories: greenhouse gas emissions management, physical climate-related impacts, scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, and the impact of climate change on operations. The company has adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements, and its practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change. The company has implemented various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for its information, facilities, and infrastructure. The company has business continuity plans in place, and while it continues to evolve and modify these plans, there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts. The company recognizes that its operations present hazards and risks that require significant and continuous oversight, including operational hazards such as explosions, fires, and severe weather. The company’s operations may be disrupted if it does not respond appropriately to any major crisis or if it is unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity. The company is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on its operations. The company regularly assesses the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of contingencies and environmental liabilities. The company has established a comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserves, which reflects its organizational capabilities and strategic initiatives. The company’s internal control processes are reviewed annually to ensure adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy. The company’s commitment to its value proposition positions it for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility, emphasizing the importance of operational flexibility and strategic adaptation in the face of external pressures and disruptive events.

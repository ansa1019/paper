Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to increase revenues from sales of our CF medicines, which requires us to gain approval and reimbursement for our triple combination therapy in ex-U.S. markets and successfully develop and commercialize our therapies. Our concentrated source of revenues presents risks, including potential competition from therapies developed for CF, reimbursement policies that may affect our pricing, and manufacturing or supply disruptions. We are investing significant resources in the research and development of therapies for serious diseases, and our ability to diversify our revenue base is critical. We have experienced challenges in obtaining reimbursement for our products in various countries, which can significantly impact our revenues. The reimbursement process can be lengthy and is subject to governmental control, particularly in ex-U.S. markets. Our medicines treat life-threatening conditions and address relatively small patient populations, which complicates the reimbursement landscape. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies with greater resources, as well as smaller companies and research institutions. Our success in developing and commercializing our CF medicines may increase the resources that competitors allocate to their development efforts. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, our commercialization efforts could be adversely affected. Our products are subject to ongoing regulatory oversight, and any adverse safety events could lead to significant repercussions for our business. We have adopted a business continuity plan to address crises, but if we are unable to implement these plans effectively, we may experience significant disruptions in our operations. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers for our products exposes us to supply chain risks, and any disruptions could adversely affect our ability to meet customer needs. We must manage our operational and financial infrastructure effectively to support our expanding global operations. The increasing availability of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals for rare diseases has generated significant interest from third-party payors in developing cost-containment strategies. We are subject to various laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal information, and failure to comply could result in significant penalties. Our research and development activities are subject to numerous risks, including the potential for delays or failures in clinical trials. We continuously monitor our drug development programs and may need to adjust our focus based on new data and insights. Our ability to attract and retain skilled employees is critical to our success, and we face intense competition for qualified personnel. We must also navigate the complexities of operating in foreign markets, including differing regulatory requirements and potential geopolitical risks. Our financial condition is influenced by our ability to manage our capital structure and access liquidity as needed. The successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to various risks, which could materially affect our business and financial results.

JPMorgan Chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology, and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. The ability to respond effectively to a business interruption could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets, or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed. Furthermore, should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase's business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties, and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase's operations or operational systems, or any catastrophic event, could hinder its ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties, require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, and cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries.

JPMorgan Chase's operations are subject to heightened scrutiny and regulatory oversight, which could result in increased operational and compliance costs. The firm has experienced significant changes in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, which could require it to make further changes to its business and operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations and could reduce its profitability. The firm must comply with economic sanctions and anti-corruption laws, which can increase operational and compliance costs and risks. Changes in immigration policies could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase's ability to attract and retain qualified employees, thereby affecting the quality of its workforce.

The effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase's operational systems is critical to its business continuity and resilience. The firm relies on its financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing, and other operational systems to process, record, monitor, and report transactions accurately and securely. Any disruption or failure of these systems could result in delays or other disruptions in providing information, services, and liquidity to clients and customers, potentially leading to financial losses and client dissatisfaction. Additionally, the interconnectivity with external operational systems increases operational risks, as failures at external parties could impact JPMorgan Chase's operations.

JPMorgan Chase's risk management framework is designed to identify and mitigate risks, but any inadequacy or lapse could expose it to unexpected losses. The firm relies on data to assess its various risk exposures, and deficiencies in data quality or effectiveness could result in ineffective risk management practices. The reliance on historical trends for risk management strategies may not accurately predict future events, particularly during periods of market stress. Furthermore, the firm faces significant legal risks from private actions and regulatory investigations, which could materially and adversely affect its business and reputation.

Overall, JPMorgan Chase's ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is influenced by its operational resilience, regulatory compliance, risk management effectiveness, and the capacity to adapt to external pressures and disruptions.

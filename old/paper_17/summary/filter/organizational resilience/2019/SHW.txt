The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition. Adverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide may reduce the demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. Higher inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates, and unemployment rates, along with business disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents, public health crises, and natural disasters, could adversely affect demand for some of our products and our results of operations. A weakening or reversal of the general economic recovery may adversely impact our net sales, the collection of accounts receivable, and our investments. We finance a portion of our sales through trade credit, and tight credit markets could limit our ability to collect accounts receivable. Our ability to generate cash is dependent on many factors beyond our control, including the performance of our subsidiaries, which are separate legal entities. The success of future acquisitions depends on our ability to integrate operations and manage challenges that may arise. Risks associated with expansion into foreign markets could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to various domestic and foreign laws, regulations, and compliance risks, which could lead to significant liability. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may impose increasingly stringent requirements. The company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities, and our liability may exceed current amounts accrued. We continuously assess our potential liability for environmental-related activities and adjust our accruals as information becomes available. Our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, and regulatory factors beyond our control. We are exposed to market risks associated with interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity fluctuations, and we utilize derivative instruments as part of our financial risk management policy. The company has implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote compliance with health, safety, and environmental laws. Our operations may be impacted by adverse weather conditions or climate change, which could temporarily reduce demand for some of our products. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, and the ultimate result of any present or future litigation is unpredictable, which may result in costs significantly higher than currently accrued. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical for maintaining operational continuity. We continuously assess our operational management strategies, including our response mechanisms to crises and unexpected situations, to ensure resilience and adaptability in our business practices. The companyâ€™s strategic initiatives focus on enhancing organizational capabilities and maintaining performance under pressure, which are essential for navigating complex situations and ensuring long-term sustainability.

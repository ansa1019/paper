The company must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change, and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development, which is essential for maintaining operational continuity and addressing customer needs. We must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers' products, as failure to adequately predict these needs may lead to significant revenue losses. Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets we serve, and any decline or lower than expected growth in these markets could diminish demand for our products and services, adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. We are pursuing several strategies to improve internal growth, including strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets, allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects, and expanding our service offerings. Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties, which could lead to reduced demand for some of our products and increased pressure on prices. We are also subject to economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Disruptions from natural disasters, public health crises, and other catastrophic events may impact customer spending and disrupt our facilities or those of third parties on which we depend. Our significant operations in California expose us to earthquake risk, and any such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results. The company has internal controls and compliance systems to protect against acts committed by employees or agents that would violate laws, but we cannot assure that these controls will prevent every wrongful act. We rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, and significant disruptions in these services could disrupt our ability to ship products and lower our profitability. Our operations are subject to extensive ongoing regulation, and any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, and our ability to realize the value of these assets will depend on future cash flows, which in turn depend on how well we integrate acquired businesses. We have identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges, but these actions are expected to yield annual cost savings. Our ability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements is critical, as any significant disruptions could materially interrupt our operations and harm our reputation. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future.

The cloud networking market is rapidly evolving, and our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers, which reflects our operational flexibility and adaptability. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively and to improve our systems and processes. We must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new technologies that address emerging technological trends and changing end-customer needs. The process of enhancing our existing products and developing new technology is complex and uncertain, requiring significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements or marketable new products. Our relationships with our strategic alliance partners may shift as industry dynamics change, and we may face increased competition from established competitors and new market entrants, which could lead to increased pricing pressures and reduced profit margins. The loss of large end customers or significant delays in their purchases could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We are also subject to risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations, which may require us to comply with various regulations that could impose additional costs or limit our ability to conduct business effectively. Our business is subject to the risks of natural disasters, health epidemics, and other catastrophic events, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We increasingly depend upon our IT systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations, and breaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. The successful assertion of claims against us could result in significant costs and harm our business. Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting is critical, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our financial reporting and operations. We have experienced reduced and volatile demand from certain of our large end customers, which could continue in future periods and impact our revenue growth. Our business strategy focuses primarily on long-term growth, which may result in lower profitability in the short term. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on various factors, including pricing pressures and changes in customer demand. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to develop market-leading products and features that address the needs of our end customers and our ability to sell these products to new and existing customers. We must continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform and introduce new products and features. If we fail to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products and services to our existing end customers, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.

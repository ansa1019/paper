Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact results, affecting operational flexibility and resilience. The company’s global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, including fluctuations in freight costs and limitations on shipping capacity, which could disrupt economic activity and impact resilience strategies. Unexpected events, including natural disasters and pandemics, could adversely affect operations and financial performance, leading to partial or complete closure of facilities and disruption in supply chains.

The success of the business depends on leading-edge innovation and the ability to maintain key relationships with dealers and customers. The company’s financial products segment is significant to operations and provides financing support, which is crucial for maintaining liquidity and operational resilience. The ability to manage risks associated with financial markets and customer creditworthiness is vital for sustaining performance under pressure.

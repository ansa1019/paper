In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are specific to our own businesses. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, enabling us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined risk framework and an articulated risk appetite statement. Our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take to maintain a strong and flexible financial position, allowing us to withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. We continuously monitor our balance sheet position to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes, which is critical for operational continuity. 

We have developed and maintain contingency plans designed to prepare us in advance to respond to potential adverse economic, financial, or market stress. These plans include our capital contingency plan and financial contingency and recovery plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, and actions to enable us to increase capital and access funding sources. Our lines of business operate with risk limits that align with the corporation's risk appetite, and executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements to ensure adherence to these limits. 

The corporation's risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings, or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives. This appetite is formally articulated in the risk appetite statement, which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan, and liquidity requirements, addressing strategic risks and ensuring that we can adapt to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic, or competitive environments. 

Operational risk is a significant concern, as it includes the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, and systems. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day operations, and their actions can expose us to risk. Our operational and security systems infrastructure is integral to our performance, and we continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth. 

We utilize various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures, but these are subject to inherent limitations. In times of market stress, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, which may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. We also face reputational risk, which may arise from negative perceptions of our conduct or business practices, potentially impacting our profitability or operations. 

Our ability to manage risk is inherently limited by our capacity to identify all risks, including emerging and unknown risks, and to anticipate the timing of risks. We conduct regular reviews and evaluations of our risk management practices to ensure they remain effective and responsive to the evolving business environment and external pressures.

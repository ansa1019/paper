Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by global economic, capital market and political conditions, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain operational continuity under challenging circumstances. The tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing, potentially resulting in a decrease in orders for our products and services. Our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries, which are influenced by external factors including fluctuations in economic activity and geopolitical risks. A slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect our financial performance, indicating the need for adaptability in our operational strategies. The cyclical nature of the commercial aviation and defense industries means that our results are directly tied to economic conditions, and any significant reductions in demand could materially impact our competitive position. Our international operations expose us to economic risks, including changes in foreign currency fluctuations and local government regulations, which may affect product demand and operational effectiveness. Changes in trade policies and tariffs can also impact our ability to respond effectively to market conditions, necessitating strategic resilience and adaptability in our business model. We rely on a variety of raw materials and supplier-provided parts, and disruptions in supply chains could adversely affect our ability to meet customer commitments, highlighting the importance of effective resource management and risk mitigation strategies. Our restructuring plans, aimed at improving operational efficiencies, may face challenges that could disrupt our business and impede our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions. Cyber-attacks and other business disruptions pose significant risks to our information technology infrastructure, which could impact our operational capabilities and overall performance. We continue to invest in measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities to mitigate potential risks. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of technological advancements is contingent upon various factors, including timely execution of internal and external performance plans and the availability of qualified personnel. The complex nature of our contracts, particularly with the U.S. government, subjects us to risks that could adversely affect our margins and operational performance. Our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and divestitures, may encounter difficulties that could impede our ability to integrate new businesses effectively and realize expected benefits. The evolving nature of regulatory compliance, particularly concerning cybersecurity and anti-bribery laws, presents ongoing challenges that could impact our operational integrity and competitive position. Overall, our capacity to absorb strain and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is critical to our organizational resilience and long-term success.

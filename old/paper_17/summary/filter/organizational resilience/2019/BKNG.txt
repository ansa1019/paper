The risks and uncertainties described could impair our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Economic or political disruptions could negatively affect travel demand and our results of operations. Events beyond our control, such as oil prices, stock market volatility, terrorist attacks, unusual or extreme weather, travel-related health concerns, and political instability, may disrupt travel and limit the willingness of travelers to visit certain locations. These unpredictable events can dramatically affect consumer travel behavior and demand for our services. We may experience volatility in transaction growth rates and increased cancellation rates due to macro-economic conditions. The uncertainty of macro-economic factors makes it more difficult to forecast industry trends and manage our business effectively. Our strategy involves continued expansion worldwide, which may increase the complexity of our operations and place additional strain on our management and resources. We are increasing collaboration among our brands to maximize the benefits of our scale and improve the consumer experience. We have experienced significant growth in our accommodation reservation services, driven by the shift from offline to online travel purchases and the adoption of mobile devices. However, our growth rates have generally decelerated, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe that providing a broad array of accommodations and improving the consumer experience are critical for maintaining our competitive advantage. Our business is subject to intense competition, and we must continuously innovate to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and consumer demands. We rely on performance and brand marketing channels to generate traffic to our platforms, and fluctuations in these channels can impact our marketing efficiency. Our performance marketing expenses have increased significantly, and we must adjust our spending based on growth and profitability objectives. We have observed increased brand marketing by competitors, which may make our efforts more expensive and less effective. Our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees is critical to our success, and competition for talent in our industry is intense. We face risks related to the growth rate and global expansion of our business, which may be affected by economic conditions and the competitiveness of the market. We are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which can impact our financial results. Our international operations represent a substantial majority of our revenues, and we must manage the complexities associated with operating in multiple jurisdictions. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to grow our brands and offer travel-related services while navigating regulatory changes and compliance costs. We are committed to investing in technology and personnel to support our growth initiatives, even if these expenditures create pressure on our operating margins. The uncertain and highly competitive environment makes it difficult to predict future results, and we may not be able to sustain revenue growth and profitability.

The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied's business, financial condition, or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business. Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business, and its business performance may be adversely affected by uncertain global economic and political conditions and demands. The company is also subject to variations in local, regional, national, or international laws and regulations, which may affect its ability to maintain appropriate business processes and comply with regulatory requirements. Applied's ability to manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, and differing employment practices is critical to its operational flexibility. The company is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy, which may cause customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing equipment or services, adversely impacting Applied's revenues and financial condition. Economic uncertainty may also affect suppliers, impairing their ability to deliver parts and negatively affecting Applied's ability to manage operations. The ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is vital to Applied's success, and fluctuations in global economic conditions may present challenges in this area. Applied's success depends significantly on the protection of its intellectual property rights, and any infringement could result in lost market opportunities. Cybersecurity threats and incidents pose risks to Applied's operations, as disruptions could lead to business interruptions and reputational damage. The company must also navigate the complexities of expanding into new and related markets, which may require additional resources and the development of new sales and technical marketing strategies. Supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions, or delays could affect Applied's ability to meet customer demand and result in excess or obsolete inventory. The company's operational continuity relies on timely supply of equipment and services that meet rapidly changing technical and volume requirements. If Applied fails to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts, it could adversely impact its business and customer relationships. The ability to manage operational resources effectively is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and adapting to changing market conditions. Applied's strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections and expanding its served market opportunities, which requires ongoing investments in research, development, and engineering. The company must maintain a competitive advantage in its offerings to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and changes in customer requirements.

The business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects of nee and fpl are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond their control. These risks may materially adversely affect their business and could cause actual results to differ substantially from expectations. In their business planning and management of operations, nee and fpl must address the effects of regulation on their business, and any inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect. The operations of nee and fpl are subject to extensive regulation, and the regulatory process may limit or adversely impact fpl's earnings. Regulatory decisions may be materially affected by political, regulatory, and economic factors, which could require fpl to cancel or delay planned development activities or incur costs that may not be recoverable. The ability to recover costs in a timely manner is critical, as significant costs may not be recoverable through regulatory mechanisms. The operations of nee and fpl are also exposed to risks associated with adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, which can disrupt operations and lead to increased costs. The impact of severe weather events, such as hurricanes, can cause power outages, property damage, and require additional costs for restoration. The physical plants of nee and fpl could be placed at greater risk of damage due to changes in the global climate, resulting in more intense and frequent weather events. The ability of nee and fpl to maintain their operations in the face of such environmental perturbations is crucial for their organizational resilience. The companies are also subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness and performance of their customers and vendors, which could lead to financial losses if counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations. The operational risks inherent in managing electric generation and transmission facilities can result in lost revenues and increased expenses due to compliance failures or legal claims. Additionally, the companies face risks related to project development, including the inability to obtain necessary licenses or permits, which could adversely affect their ability to meet customer needs and operational continuity. The management of operational resources and the ability to adapt to changing market conditions are essential for maintaining organizational effectiveness. The reliance on sensitive information technology systems presents another layer of risk, as failures or breaches could materially affect their ability to provide services. The strategic response to these challenges, including the implementation of resilience strategies and mechanisms, is vital for the long-term sustainability and success of nee and fpl. The companies must also navigate the complexities of regulatory compliance, which can impose significant costs and liabilities. The ability to manage these risks effectively is critical to ensuring organizational survival and performance under pressure.

In evaluating our business, we note that a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our HIV products, which accounted for approximately 74% of our total product sales during the year ended December 31, 2019. Our ability to maintain or increase sales of these products is critical, as any changes in treatment paradigms or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our results of operations. We face significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which may impact our market share and pricing strategies. The success of our business relies on our capacity to introduce new products and expand indications for existing products to address unmet medical needs. The product development cycle is characterized by significant investments of resources, long lead times, and unpredictable outcomes, which necessitate operational flexibility and adaptability to navigate potential disruptions. We may experience fluctuations in purchasing patterns, particularly in the non-retail sector, which could result in revenue variability. Additionally, we are subject to external pressures, including legislative and regulatory actions that could materially affect our business. Our operations depend on compliance with complex regulations, and any failure to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products. We are also exposed to risks associated with our global operations, including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and geopolitical instability, which may adversely affect our financial condition. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers introduces additional risks, as any disruptions in their operations could impair our ability to deliver products on time. Furthermore, we must effectively manage our relationships with collaborative partners and third-party service providers to ensure successful commercialization of our products. The ongoing scrutiny of our business practices, including patient assistance programs and pricing strategies, may also impact our reputation and operational continuity. Our strategic initiatives include expanding internal and external innovation, strengthening portfolio strategy, and increasing patient benefit and access. We are committed to evolving our organizational culture to support these objectives, which is essential for maintaining resilience in a competitive landscape. Our financial resources and operational capabilities will be critical in navigating the complexities of the pharmaceutical market, particularly in light of potential disruptions and the need for strategic adaptation. We anticipate that our ability to respond to these challenges will be a key determinant of our long-term success and organizational health.

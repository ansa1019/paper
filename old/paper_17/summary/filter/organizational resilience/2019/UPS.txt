Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including changes in general economic conditions that may adversely affect us. We conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories, and our operations are subject to cyclicality affecting national and international economies, as well as local economic environments. The factors resulting in economic changes are beyond our control, making it difficult to adjust our business model to mitigate their impact. We may also be affected by substantial economic uncertainty arising from geopolitical events, such as the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, which could lead to transportation delays and additional volatility in currency exchange rates. Our industry is rapidly evolving, with demand for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments. To remain competitive, we must respond effectively to competitive pressures, which may include raising prices that customers may not accept. Continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition, potentially impacting our market share and competitive position. Changes in relationships with significant customers could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if they choose to divert their business to competitors or demand pricing concessions. Our business is also subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations, which could increase operating costs and impact our ability to provide uninterrupted service. Strikes or work stoppages by employees could adversely affect our ability to meet customer needs, leading to a permanent loss of customers. We are exposed to changing fuel and energy prices, and interruptions in supplies could materially affect us. Additionally, we conduct business across the globe, and fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We regularly monitor and manage our exposures to these changes, using derivative instruments to mitigate their impact. Our success depends on maintaining our brand image and reputation for excellent service, as service quality issues could lead to a loss of customers. A significant data breach or IT system disruption could materially adversely affect us, requiring increased spending on data and system security. We rely heavily on information technology networks and systems to manage various business processes, and disruptions could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data. Severe weather conditions and other disasters may disrupt our business, leading to decreased revenues. We make significant capital investments tied to projected volume levels, and inaccuracies in forecasting could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. We continually adjust our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions, although these adjustments may not be sufficient to maintain operating margins. Economic, political, and social developments associated with international operations expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business. We are subject to changes in markets and business plans that may result in substantial write-downs of asset values. Employee health and pension benefit costs represent significant expenses, and further cost increases could materially affect us. Our participation in multiemployer pension and health plans exposes us to potential liabilities that may arise from future collective bargaining negotiations.

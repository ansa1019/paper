Our business is subject to the impact of global market, economic, and political conditions that are beyond our control and that could significantly impact our business and make our financial results more volatile. The trading volumes in our markets are directly affected by domestic and international factors, including economic, political, and geopolitical market conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, and shifts in demand or supply in commodities underlying our products. Historically, periods of heightened uncertainty have tended to increase our trading volume due to increased hedging activity and the increased need to manage the risks associated with, or speculate on, volatility. However, extreme uncertainties may lead to decreased volume due to factors such as reduced risk exposure and lower interest rates. Our strategic business plan is to operate an efficient and transparent vertically integrated transaction execution, clearing, and settlement business, which is designed to maximize operational flexibility and ensure business continuity. We face intense competition from other companies, and if we are not able to successfully compete, our business, financial condition, and operating results will be materially harmed. Our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume depends on our capacity to adapt to changing market needs and to offer competitive prices and services. We are heavily reliant on the capacity, reliability, and security of our information technology and communications systems, and any failure or degradation could lead to significant operational disruptions. We regard the secure storage and transmission of confidential information and the ability to continuously transact and clear on our electronic trading platforms as critical elements of our operations. Our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk for cyber attacks and other cybersecurity risks, which could result in interruptions in our operations and loss of customers. We have designed our cyber defense program to mitigate such attacks through preventative, detective, and responsive measures. The success of our markets depends on our ability to complete the development of, successfully implement, and maintain electronic trading systems that meet the required functionality, performance, capacity, security, and speed. We also depend on third-party suppliers and service providers for essential services, and any interruption could materially affect our business. Our compliance and risk management programs might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. We maintain compliance policies and procedures designed to deter, detect, prevent, monitor, and manage our risks, but these may not be fully effective. Our business exposes us to substantial credit risk from our clearing firms and other counterparties, and a decrease in their financial resources could adversely affect us. We are also exposed to risks from failing to meet compliance and regulatory obligations, which could result in significant penalties or reputational damage. The expansion of our global operations subjects us to increased business and economic risks, and if we are unable to manage this complexity successfully, our financial performance and operating results could suffer. Our strategic initiatives focus on maximizing growth globally and delivering operational excellence, which requires ongoing investment in technology and resources to support our growth and adapt to evolving market conditions.

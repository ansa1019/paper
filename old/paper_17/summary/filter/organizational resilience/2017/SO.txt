Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements may influence the operating environment and could lead to substantial costs or negatively affect results of operations. The company faces operational risks that could adversely affect financial performance, including operator error, equipment failure, and environmental events. The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful operation of electric utilities and natural gas distribution facilities, with risks that could limit their ability to operate effectively. The company must navigate a complex regulatory landscape, which includes compliance with environmental laws that may require substantial expenditures and could negatively impact net income, cash flows, and financial condition. The impact of greenhouse gas legislation and regulation poses additional risks, as future constraints may create demand for natural gas while also increasing costs.

The registrants are committed to maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of environmental perturbations and other external pressures, including the need for strategic adaptation to evolving market conditions. The company’s workforce management is critical, as failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could lead to operational challenges and loss of internal knowledge. The registrants face risks associated with construction projects, including potential cost overruns and delays that could impact financial results. Additionally, the financial condition of Southern Company and its subsidiaries is dependent on their ability to access capital markets, which may be affected by changes in credit ratings or market conditions.

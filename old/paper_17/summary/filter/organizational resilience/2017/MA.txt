Global regulatory and legislative activity related to the payments industry may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations, as regulators increasingly seek to establish or expand their authority to regulate certain aspects of payment systems. Increased regulation and oversight may result in costly compliance burdens or otherwise increase our costs, potentially impacting our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services. Such laws or compliance burdens could result in issuers being less willing to participate in our payments system, which may reduce the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions and adversely affect our profitability. The regulatory landscape is complex, with obligations that may conflict across jurisdictions, creating pressures that could limit our operational flexibility and adaptability to changes in the business environment. 

We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in many jurisdictions, and the increased regulatory focus on our operations may lead to costly compliance burdens. The potential outcome of regulatory proceedings could have a more positive or negative impact on us relative to our competitors. Our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers, as well as their ability to effectively manage our brands. Any significant loss of business from one or more of our largest financial institution customers could lead to substantial revenue decreases in the longer term. 

Operational difficulties, such as service disruptions due to technology malfunctions or external disturbances, could materially affect our overall business and results of operations. We maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies. However, we cannot ensure that our business would be immune to these risks. Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and increase our costs. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information, and we are likely to continue being a target of cyber threats.

Our acquisition of Vocalink has expanded our capability to process automated clearing house transactions, but it also presents regulatory and operational risks associated with administering a new type of payments network. The complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities. We are also working to embed new products and technology acquired from Vocalink into our existing markets, which requires tight integration and collaboration with the corporate culture of Vocalink.

The global payments industry is characterized by rapid technological changes and intense competition, which may impact our ability to adapt and innovate. Our failure to keep pace with technological developments or to effectively manage our relationships with customers and stakeholders may adversely affect our business. As we continue to diversify our integrated products and services, we face risks associated with operational challenges and potential reputational damage if these new products or services do not perform as intended. 

Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings. We rely on existing liquidity, cash generated from operations, and access to capital to fund our global operations and manage risks associated with settlement exposure. The ability to effectively respond to these challenges is critical for maintaining organizational resilience and ensuring operational continuity in a dynamic and often turbulent market environment.

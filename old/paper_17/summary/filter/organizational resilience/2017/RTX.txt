Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by global economic, capital market and political conditions, which may affect our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to external pressures. The tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing, potentially resulting in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services. Our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries, which are influenced by fluctuations in economic activity, regulatory changes, and customer attrition. A slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect our financial performance, while our aerospace businesses are directly tied to economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries. Future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues, or major natural disasters could dramatically reduce demand for air travel, negatively impacting our sales and margins. Our international operations are subject to economic risks, including changes in foreign currency fluctuations and local government regulations, which could affect product demand and our competitive position. We engage in acquisitions and divestitures to grow strategically, but we may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses, which could disrupt our operations and affect our ability to realize anticipated benefits. Our debt levels and related obligations could limit our flexibility in responding to changes in market conditions and expose us to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. We may be adversely affected by attacks on our information technology infrastructure, which could disrupt operations and compromise confidential information. Our reliance on suppliers exposes us to volatility in prices and availability of materials, and disruptions in deliveries could materially affect our ability to meet customer commitments. We undertake restructuring plans to operate more efficiently, but if not managed successfully, these actions could disrupt our operations and impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions. We are subject to various legal and compliance risks that could adversely affect our competitive position and financial condition. Changes in tax laws and regulations could impact our tax liabilities and deferred tax assets. Our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results. We continue to invest in research and development to pursue advancements in technology, but delays in product development could result in increased costs and affect our competitive position. Our business may be affected by government contracting risks, including potential investigations and audits that could lead to significant liabilities. We must comply with various export control and sanctions regulations, and any failure to do so could disrupt our operations. Overall, our ability to adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain operational flexibility is critical for our organizational resilience and long-term success.

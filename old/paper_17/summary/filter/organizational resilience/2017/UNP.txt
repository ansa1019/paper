We must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity; if there are significant reductions in demand for rail services or changes in consumer preferences, we may experience increased costs associated with resizing our operations, including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives, rail cars, and other equipment. Although we continue to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, and enhance our ability to address surges in demand with adequate resources, we cannot be sure that these measures will fully address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity. We face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers, and any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We rely on technology in all aspects of our business, and if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage. A cyber attack or other event causing significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems could lead to service interruptions or operational difficulties. We transport hazardous materials that pose risks in the event of a release or combustion, and a rail accident involving these materials could involve significant costs and claims that could adversely affect our financial condition. We are subject to significant governmental regulation, and changes in the legislative or regulatory frameworks could adversely affect our business. Prolonged severe adverse economic conditions or disruptions in financial and credit markets may affect our access to liquidity and our results of operations. We are exposed to severe weather conditions that can adversely affect our entire rail network and can impact revenue, costs, and liabilities. Strikes or work stoppages could cause significant disruptions in our operations, and labor disputes could compromise our service reliability. Changes in demographics and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service. We maintain adequate resources and have access to capital markets to meet foreseeable cash requirements. Our capital plan includes expenditures to renew and improve existing infrastructure and to invest in new capacity, which are critical for enhancing long-term value and operational continuity. We expect our plan will enhance the long-term value of the company by providing sufficient resources to replace and improve our existing track infrastructure, increase network efficiency, and meet customer demand. We are also exploring opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment, including investments in new technologies and training programs to increase fuel efficiency. Our operations are subject to various claims and lawsuits, and we cannot fully determine the effect of all claims on our financial condition. We are committed to a multi-faceted approach to safety, utilizing technology, risk assessment, training, and employee engagement to improve operational safety and efficiency. Our strategic initiatives focus on aligning resources with customer demand and maintaining an efficient network to ensure operational flexibility and resilience in the face of disruptions.

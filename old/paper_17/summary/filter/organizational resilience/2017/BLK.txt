As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock's business. BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, fiduciary, and investment risks. The investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry, requiring BlackRock to adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive. Increased competition may cause the company's assets under management (AUM), revenue, and earnings to decline. The failure to maintain Aladdin's competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and impede productivity and growth. Operating risks associated with BlackRock's securities lending program may result in client losses, and the failure of BlackRock's controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses. BlackRock's decision to provide support to particular products or the inability to provide support may also cause AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline. Increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional, and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock's AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline. The company's management believes that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline. BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions, and any errors in the underlying models could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock's business and reputation. A failure in BlackRock's operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could disrupt operations, damage the company's reputation, and cause AUM, revenue, and earnings to decline. Despite efforts to ensure business continuity, if BlackRock fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans are improperly implemented during a disruption, the company's ability to operate could be adversely impacted. A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies could disrupt operations and cause financial losses. BlackRock's reliance on third parties for various operational needs exposes it to risks, and the failure or inability of these third parties may adversely affect operations and could lead to a loss of clients. The company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. BlackRock's ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends on its ability to maintain and grow its AUM, creditworthiness, and operating cash flows. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. The company must routinely address conflicts of interest and the perception of conflicts, and if it fails to deal appropriately with any conflict, it may face reputational damage, litigation, or regulatory proceedings. BlackRock's success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce, and the company's ability to plan for future growth by identifying and developing employees who can transition into key roles is critical. The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock's operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, and damage the company's reputation.

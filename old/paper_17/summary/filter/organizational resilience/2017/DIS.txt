In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the table of contents, the most significant factors affecting our operations include changes in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions that could have an adverse effect on the profitability of some or all of our businesses. A decline in economic activity can adversely affect demand, thus reducing our revenue and earnings, and similar impacts can be expected should such conditions recur. Our businesses create entertainment, travel, and consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to consistently create and distribute offerings that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market and respond to competition from an expanding array of choices facilitated by technological developments. We regularly consider and implement changes to our business models in response to developments, and there can be no assurance that we will successfully respond to these changes or that the business models we develop will be as profitable as our current business models. 

A variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services, impair our ability to provide them, or increase the cost of providing them. Demand for our products, particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, which can be significantly adversely affected by various factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, catastrophic events, health concerns, and international political developments. An incident affecting our property directly could have a direct impact on our ability to provide goods and services and could discourage consumers from attending our facilities. 

Changes in our business strategy or restructuring may increase our costs or otherwise affect profitability. External events, including changing technology and consumer patterns, may impair the value of our assets, and we may incur costs to change our business strategy. Increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs, as we face substantial competition from alternative providers of products and services. 

Labor disputes may disrupt our operations and adversely affect profitability, as a significant number of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The seasonality of certain businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on operations, as revenues fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy. 

We believe that the company's financial condition is strong, and that its cash balances, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets, and borrowing capacity provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures. However, the company's operating cash flow and access to capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. 

We maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering, and theft, and despite our efforts to prevent such occurrences, risks remain. If our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct business may be impaired, and we may incur costs or lose revenue. 

In summary, our ability to adapt to changing conditions, manage risks, and maintain operational continuity is critical to our organizational resilience and overall performance.

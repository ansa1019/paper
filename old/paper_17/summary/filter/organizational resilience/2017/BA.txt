An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. Our commercial airplanes and global services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines and are subject to unique risks, including significant deterioration in the global economic environment or the financial stability of our major customers, which could result in fewer new orders or cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders. Our commercial airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, and meet stringent performance and reliability standards. The complexity of the commercial aircraft business involves extensive coordination and integration with suppliers, skilled labor, and regulatory requirements. Operational challenges impacting the production system could result in production delays and failure to meet customer demand, negatively impacting revenues and operating margins. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements to maintain profitability. The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and certification schedules. Our ability to deliver aircraft on time and satisfy regulatory and customer requirements is subject to significant risks. Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending or acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government and are subject to extensive procurement regulations, which could increase compliance costs. Business conducted pursuant to government contracts is subject to unique risks, including the potential for contract modifications or terminations. Our operations are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations, which could result in substantial costs. The aerospace markets we serve are expected to grow, driven by increasing demand for aftermarket services and the need for modernization of aging equipment. Our strategy focuses on successful execution in core businesses supplemented by Boeing Capital, which provides financing solutions for our customers. We face intense competition in the commercial jet airplane market, necessitating major productivity gains to ensure a favorable market position. Our commercial airplanes segment has experienced revenue decreases due to delivery mix and fewer deliveries, while our defense, space, and security segment has faced challenges related to lower milestone revenue and delivery mix. The global services market is competitive, with pressures on pricing expected to continue. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain operational flexibility is critical for sustaining performance under pressure. We also rely on collaboration networks and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance our resilience strategies. The complexity of our operations requires effective risk management and strategic foresight to navigate environmental disruptions and maintain organizational effectiveness. Our financial position is influenced by various factors, including pension obligations and environmental liabilities, which require careful planning and resource allocation. The ongoing uncertainty regarding defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment necessitates a focus on cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives to ensure long-term organizational resilience.

In evaluating our business and us, we recognize that acquisitions present many risks, including the possible disruption of ongoing business and diversion of management's attention by acquisition, transition, and integration activities. The potential inability to successfully pursue or realize anticipated revenue opportunities associated with acquisitions could impact our organizational resilience. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses or achieve anticipated operating efficiencies or cost savings, which could affect our ability to maintain performance under pressure. The possibility of customer dissatisfaction if we are unable to achieve levels of quality and stability on par with past practices could also hinder our organizational health. Furthermore, the retention of relationships with key customers, landlords, and suppliers of the acquired businesses is critical, as their termination of contracts could disrupt our operational continuity. 

Our reliance on transition services from acquired entities necessitates the development of sustainable alternative arrangements, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility. The integration of IT systems may create risks of errors or performance problems, affecting our ability to meet customer service level obligations. The potential deterioration in our ability to access credit markets due to increased leverage poses a significant risk to our financial resources and operational resilience. 

We face external pressures from adverse global economic conditions and credit market uncertainty, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. The uncertain economic environment may lead to churn in our customer base and reductions in revenues from our offerings, thereby affecting our adaptability and resilience strategies. 

The ongoing political and economic instability resulting from events such as Brexit could have an adverse impact on our operations and employees in affected regions, emphasizing the need for effective crisis management and organizational foresight. Our international operations are subject to various risks, including compliance with evolving governmental regulations and the need to manage across cultures and languages, which may challenge our operational management and strategic adaptation.

We must continue to evolve our product strategy and differentiate our offerings from those of competitors to maintain a competitive advantage. The ability to anticipate and address risks, including those related to economic and political uncertainties in developing markets, is crucial for our organizational resilience. 

Our substantial debt and related covenants may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry, placing us at a competitive disadvantage. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, highlighting the importance of resilience engineering and proactive measures in our strategic planning. 

Additionally, we are making significant investments in our back office information technology systems, which, while necessary for future growth, may introduce operational complexities and risks that could impact our organizational effectiveness and resilience. The collective impact of these changes places significant demands on employees, increasing the risk of errors and control deficiencies in our financial statements.

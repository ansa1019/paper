The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deere's business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions. These risk factors could affect particular lines of business and may be interrelated. International, national, and regional trade laws, regulations, and policies could significantly impair John Deere's profitability and growth prospects, impacting its ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deere's ability to export goods and services and limits access to raw materials and components at competitive prices. Trade restrictions could limit John Deere's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in international markets and impair its competitive position. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment, which is critical for maintaining operational continuity. John Deere's operations may be impacted by non-U.S. regulatory reforms and changes in banking, monetary, and fiscal policies that could negatively affect its customers and markets. The company's operations are also subject to adverse effects from financial regulatory reform, which could increase compliance costs and affect its financial services segment. Negative economic conditions can materially weaken demand for John Deere's equipment and services, limiting access to funding and resulting in higher costs. The demand for John Deere's products can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment and cautious consumer spending. Sustained negative economic conditions affect housing starts and construction activity, which could adversely impact John Deere's results of operations. Furthermore, John Deere's ability to understand its customers' preferences and to develop products that meet demand is critical to its success. The company is dependent on its ability to attract, train, and retain qualified personnel, as failure to do so could impair its ability to execute its business strategy. John Deere's operations, suppliers, and customers are subject to increasingly rigorous environmental, health, and safety laws, which could result in significant fines or penalties. The company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secret laws to protect its intellectual property rights, and any infringement could adversely affect its business. John Deere's global operations must comply with anti-corruption laws, and violations could have an adverse effect on its reputation and financial condition. The company's business may be affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for equipment. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress or natural disasters could affect operations and profitability. John Deere's equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations, and compliance with these regulations may incur substantial costs. The potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere's facilities and operations are uncertain and could adversely impact demand for its products. Security breaches and disruptions to information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations and compromise sensitive information, potentially damaging the company's reputation.

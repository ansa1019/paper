The following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements: adverse economic and/or capital access changes in the markets served by us or in countries in which we have significant investments, including the impact on customer demand and our ability and our suppliers' ability to access financial markets at favorable rates and terms. Our ability to absorb revenue losses caused by increasing competition, including offerings that use alternative technologies or delivery methods, and our ability to maintain capital expenditures, is critical. The extent of competition, including from governmental networks and other providers, results in pressure on customer totals and segment operating margins, necessitating our ability to develop attractive and profitable product/service offerings to offset increasing competition. Our ability to manage growth in wireless video and data services, including network quality and acquisition of adequate spectrum at reasonable costs and terms, is essential for maintaining operational flexibility. The impact from major equipment failures on our networks, including satellites operated by directv, and the effect of security breaches related to the network or customer information, highlight the need for effective crisis management and resilience strategies. Our ability to adequately fund our wireless operations, including payment for additional spectrum and network upgrades, is vital for sustaining operational continuity. The uncertainty surrounding further congressional action to address spending reductions may result in a significant decrease in government spending and reluctance of businesses and consumers to spend in general, which could affect our organizational health. The final outcome of state and federal legislative efforts involving issues that are important to our business, including privacy and net neutrality, may also impact our strategic response to external pressures. Our ability to close our pending acquisition of time warner inc. and successfully reorganize our operations is contingent upon managing various businesses in widely dispersed business locations and with decentralized management. The ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change is essential for our organizational resilience. The continued development and delivery of attractive and profitable video and broadband offerings, alongside our ability to match speeds offered by our competitors, are necessary for maintaining our competitive advantage. The availability and cost of additional wireless spectrum and regulations and conditions relating to spectrum use are critical for our operational management. Changes in our corporate strategies, such as changing network-related requirements or acquisitions and dispositions, may require significant amounts of cash or stock to respond to competition and regulatory, legislative, and technological developments. The impact of severe weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, energy shortages, wars, or terrorist attacks must be considered in our risk assessment and preparedness strategies. Our ability to maintain margins and attract a diverse portfolio of video, wireless service, and devices is essential for our organizational effectiveness and performance maintenance under pressure. Readers are cautioned that other factors discussed in this report, although not enumerated here, also could materially affect our future earnings.

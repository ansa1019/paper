The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical for organizational resilience. Altria Group, Inc. faces significant competition within its categories, and its failure to compete effectively could adversely affect its consolidated results of operations or cash flows. The company must continue to promote brand equity, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute products that appeal to adult consumers, and improve productivity to maintain operational flexibility. Altria Group, Inc. is subject to various governmental and private sector actions that may impact its tobacco subsidiaries' businesses and sales volumes, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use. The company’s tobacco businesses face significant competition, and the inability to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences or manage through difficult competitive and economic conditions could negatively impact its performance. The reliance on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers presents risks; an extended disruption at a facility or in service by a supplier could materially adversely affect the business. Altria Group, Inc. has achieved substantial success in managing litigation but acknowledges that litigation is subject to uncertainty, and significant challenges remain. The company is also exposed to risks inherent in reliance on information systems, and any failure of these systems could have a material adverse effect on its operations. Investments in administrative, technical, and physical safeguards are made to protect against cyber threats, including human error and malicious acts. The company continues to make investments in focus areas for long-term growth, including innovative product development and launches, which are essential for maintaining competitive advantage. Altria Group, Inc. may be required to recall products, which could adversely affect its business and reputation. The impact of decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage and tobacco control actions may impair the company’s ability to attract and retain the best talent. The company’s growth strategies involve potential moves into adjacent products or processes, including innovative tobacco products that may reduce health risks associated with current tobacco products. Adverse developments regarding regulatory approvals for new products could negatively impact the commercial viability of such products. Altria Group, Inc. must navigate complex legal and regulatory environments, including challenges related to state settlement agreements and FDA user fees, which are based on variable factors such as volume and market share. The company’s management believes that its estimated fair values of reporting units and intangible assets are reasonable, but actual performance could differ significantly from forecasted performance, potentially resulting in impairment charges. The anticipated increase in pension and postretirement expenses due to changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions reflects the ongoing need for effective resource management and strategic foresight. Overall, Altria Group, Inc. faces numerous internal and external pressures that necessitate a multifaceted approach to resilience, emphasizing adaptability, operational continuity, and proactive measures to ensure long-term success in a turbulent business environment.

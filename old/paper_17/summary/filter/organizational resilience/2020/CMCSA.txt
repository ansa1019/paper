The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations, highlighting the need for organizational resilience in maintaining operational continuity under challenging conditions. The impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have disrupted our businesses in various ways, including significant deterioration in domestic economic conditions and costs associated with supporting customer connectivity as people increasingly worked and learned remotely. The temporary closure of our theme parks and the disruption of professional sports seasons have materially impacted NBCUniversal and Sky's results of operations. Our distribution network performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by increased video streaming, gaming, and videoconferencing. We have implemented programs to support customers, including waiving certain fees and providing flexible payment options, which reflect our commitment to maintaining positive adjustment under adversity. The deterioration of economic conditions has resulted in reduced demand for certain services and increased risk associated with collections on outstanding receivables, necessitating effective risk assessment and resource management. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among various constituencies, and we continue to seek ways to enhance the value of our businesses, such as by growing high-speed internet services and investing in Peacock. The competition we face from direct-to-consumer streaming and other OTT services challenges existing business models, requiring us to adapt our service offerings and enhance operational flexibility. The acceleration of subscriber losses and audience fragmentation due to changes in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platforms further emphasizes the need for strategic resilience. The impacts of COVID-19 have also resulted in significant reductions in advertising spend, which could negatively affect our businesses. Our success depends on consumer acceptance of our content, and we must consistently create, acquire, market, and distribute programming that meets changing preferences. The loss of programming distribution and licensing agreements could adversely affect our businesses, highlighting the importance of maintaining strong inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement. We also face risks related to doing business internationally, including economic volatility, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and political risks, which could adversely affect our businesses. Our ability to adapt to emerging competitors and changes in consumer behavior is critical for maintaining our competitive position. The ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19 makes it challenging to estimate future performance, necessitating a focus on strategic foresight and proactive measures. We have implemented cost savings initiatives across our businesses, which will impact our results of operations, and we expect to continue to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses. The ongoing assessment of our operational capabilities and the ability to reconfigure our strategies in response to external pressures will be essential for our organizational resilience and long-term success.

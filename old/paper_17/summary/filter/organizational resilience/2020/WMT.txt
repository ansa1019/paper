The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is crucial. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is unpredictable, and sustaining revenue growth may be challenging. The pandemic has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and has challenged our ability to anticipate and adjust inventory levels to meet fluctuating customer demand. We face strong competition from other retailers, and failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures could adversely affect our financial performance. Natural disasters, climate change, geopolitical events, and catastrophic events could materially affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could disrupt our supply chain operations and impact customer demand. Our operational risks include the unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to increased operational costs and uncertainty regarding future performance. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in competitors' operations. Our information systems are essential to our business operations, and any disruptions could harm our ability to conduct operations. We rely on strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business, and the performance of these alliances could materially affect our financial performance. Our ability to attract and retain qualified associates is critical to our business success, and changes in labor laws or increases in labor costs could adversely affect our financial performance. We are also subject to reputational risks related to third-party sales on our digital platforms, which could impact our brand and financial performance. The ability to maintain security over our digital platforms is essential, as cyber threats are evolving and could disrupt our operations. Our compliance with various laws and regulations is critical, and any failure to comply could result in significant legal and financial exposure. The impact of new laws and regulations may require extensive operational changes, increase costs, or adversely affect our reputation. The various risks inherent in doing business in multiple jurisdictions may be exaggerated by the difficulty of managing operations in less stable regions. Our strategic planning must account for economic factors that may adversely affect our financial performance, including changes in consumer spending and shopping patterns. We must effectively manage our resources to maintain operational continuity and respond to unexpected situations. Our organizational practices, including crisis management and strategic initiatives, are essential for resilience in the face of adversity. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences is vital for sustaining our competitive advantage and ensuring organizational health.

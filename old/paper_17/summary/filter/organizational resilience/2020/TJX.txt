The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected our business operations, financial position, and liquidity, highlighting the importance of organizational resilience in maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The pandemic has necessitated temporary closures of our stores, online businesses, and distribution centers, impacting our ability to generate sales while continuing to incur expenses. We have implemented new practices and protocols, including enhanced cleaning and health safety measures, which resulted in additional operational costs while potentially impacting sales opportunities. The pandemic has also altered our associates' willingness or ability to work, affecting staffing levels in our stores and distribution centers. Changes in consumer behavior and spending, driven by health concerns and economic pressures, have further impacted our financial performance and operational flexibility. Our ability to manage inventory effectively has been challenged, as we must respond to rapidly changing customer demand and preferences while maintaining appropriate resource allocation. The complexities introduced by the pandemic have required us to adapt our operational strategies, including opportunistic buying and inventory management, to mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions. The financial viability of some of our suppliers has been affected, necessitating adjustments to our operations and resource deployment. We have established global task force teams to navigate the crisis, focusing on strategies that enhance our organizational health and resilience. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic may lead to additional temporary closures and modifications to our operations, emphasizing the need for effective crisis management and preparedness. We have taken steps to protect our associates and customers, implementing social distancing protocols and enhancing cleaning efforts. Our financial actions, including negotiating rent deferrals and extending payment terms on merchandise orders, have been critical in managing liquidity during this period. We continue to evaluate our financial position in light of evolving challenges, ensuring that our existing cash and credit facilities are adequate to meet operational needs. The impact of the pandemic has resulted in significant fluctuations in our operating results, necessitating a focus on maintaining performance under pressure. Our growth strategy includes expanding into new markets and channels, which requires effective management of our organizational capabilities and resources. The challenges posed by the pandemic have underscored the importance of strategic resilience and adaptability in our operations, as we strive to navigate through adversity and position ourselves for future success.

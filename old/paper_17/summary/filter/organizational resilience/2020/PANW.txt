Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the impacts of COVID-19, which may exacerbate existing risks and create new challenges. The recent global COVID-19 outbreak could harm our business and results of operations, as it has negatively impacted worldwide economic activity and financial markets. We have taken measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus and minimize risks to our employees and partners, including transitioning our employee population to work remotely. These precautionary measures could negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, and create operational challenges. The impact of COVID-19 is fluid and uncertain, leading to increased requests for delayed payment terms and changes in demand for our products, which may require us to reprioritize our engineering and research and development efforts. Our ability to manage future growth effectively is contingent upon improving and expanding our information technology and operational systems, as well as managing headcount and capital efficiently. Failure to manage growth could result in increased costs, disrupt existing customer relationships, and harm our business performance. The variability and unpredictability of our operating results may result in our failure to meet revenue expectations, which could adversely affect our stock price and lead to costly lawsuits. We are also exposed to fluctuations in global macroeconomic conditions, which could impact sales of our products and subscriptions and lead to longer sales cycles. Additionally, we face risks associated with our reliance on manufacturing partners, which could disrupt our supply chain and impact our ability to fulfill orders. Our corporate culture fosters innovation and teamwork, essential for maintaining our competitive position and adapting to changing market conditions. However, as we grow, maintaining this culture may become challenging, potentially limiting our ability to innovate and retain personnel. We must continue to invest in our research and development efforts to meet the evolving needs of our end-customers and improve our competitive position. The expansion of our international operations requires significant management attention and financial resources, and failure to manage these effectively could limit future growth. We are also subject to risks associated with changes in economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate, including the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and its potential impact on our business. Our future performance depends on our ability to navigate these challenges, manage our resources effectively, and respond to the evolving needs of our customers while ensuring operational continuity and resilience in the face of adversity.

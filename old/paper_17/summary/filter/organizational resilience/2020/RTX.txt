Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be impacted by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, which could affect government priorities, budgets, and policies, impacting sales of defense and other products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased global economic and demand uncertainty, adversely affecting our business, supply chains, and operations. Disruptions to air travel and commercial activities have negatively impacted the global supply, demand, and distribution capabilities of the aerospace and commercial airlines industries. The pandemic has resulted in reduced demand for our products and services, with airlines deferring maintenance services and accelerating the retirement of aircraft, negatively impacting our aftermarket revenues. We are facing operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, workplace disruptions, and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. Continued reduced operations and business disruption could hinder or delay our production capabilities and may result in increased costs. The pandemic may also affect our ability to hire, develop, and retain our talented workforce, impacting our corporate culture. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions to keep our cost structure competitive. The integration of legacy businesses from the Raytheon merger presents challenges, including managing a larger, more complex combined aerospace and defense business and maintaining employee morale. We have experienced significant declines in revenues and have recorded substantial restructuring charges related to personnel reductions to preserve capital. Our operational flexibility is critical as we navigate these challenges, and we are actively mitigating costs and adjusting production schedules to accommodate declines in demand. Our defense operations are affected by U.S. Department of Defense budget and spending levels, changes in demand, and shifts in government priorities, which can impact our competitive position. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions is essential for maintaining organizational resilience. We are also subject to risks associated with supply chain disruptions, which could adversely affect our ability to meet commitments to customers. The evolving nature of cybersecurity threats presents additional challenges, as disruptions to our IT infrastructure could impact business operations and result in financial losses. We continue to make investments to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities. The uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and its long-term implications necessitate a proactive approach to risk management and strategic adaptation. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is vital for our organizational health and success in a turbulent market environment. The ongoing evaluation of our operational resources and strategic initiatives will be critical in navigating future challenges and ensuring our resilience.

Our business, operations, and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our organizational resilience. The ongoing pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy and disrupted normal business activity, leading to significant logistical challenges and product delays. We have experienced disruptions to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain, with suppliers increasing lead times or placing products on allocation. In response to governmental directives and recommended safety measures, we modified our workplace practices globally, resulting in many employees working remotely for extended periods. This shift may reduce efficiency and productivity, causing product development delays and hampering new product innovation. Our dependence on a small number of significant customers increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and sensitivity to adverse developments experienced by these customers. Additionally, we rely on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components, which may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Any substantial disruption in our supply chain could materially harm our business and customer relationships. We are also subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. Our business is characterized by significant customer concentration, and the loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses, and we may incur significant costs related to warranty and product liability claims. We have made substantial investments in research and development, and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business. We are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations. The average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly, which could harm our revenue and gross profit. Our ability to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity and product yields is crucial to meet anticipated customer demand. A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are also dependent on our IT systems and third-party vendors to provide necessary services, and any failure of these systems could disrupt our operations. Our organizational resilience is further challenged by the need to adapt to changing market conditions and customer demands, as well as the pressures from competition and technological advancements. We continue to monitor the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and have taken various actions to de-risk our operations, including building semiconductor products to order instead of based on customer forecasts. The degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business will depend on future developments beyond our control. Overall, our ability to navigate these challenges and maintain operational continuity is critical for our organizational effectiveness and long-term success.

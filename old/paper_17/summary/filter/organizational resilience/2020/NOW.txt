Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacting the business of our customers, partners, and vendors. The pandemic disrupted the flow of the economy and put unprecedented strains on various sectors, leading to curtailed customer demand and reduced spending. In response to the pandemic, we focused on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers, and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business. We temporarily closed most of our offices, encouraged remote work, and implemented travel restrictions, which may affect our operational flexibility and workplace culture. We released emergency response applications to help customers navigate pandemic management and support their health and safety. The impact of these operational changes remains uncertain, but we have not seen adverse effects on our ability to maintain operations, including financial reporting systems and internal controls. The extent and continued impact of the pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on various developments, including government responses and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. We expect that the pandemic will have a long-term effect on our office environment and how we innovate, which may present operational challenges in the shorter term, including talent retention. Our subscription-based business model provides relatively predictable revenues, but the pandemic's effects may not be fully reflected in our results until future periods, potentially causing significant variability in our financial performance. We are also subject to risks related to our ability to grow our business in intensely competitive markets, where failure to compete effectively could harm our results. The markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving, and we must adapt to changing customer needs and technological advancements. Our success depends on our ability to innovate and respond promptly to these developments, as well as to maintain effective relationships with our customers and partners. We have made substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure to support our growth and international expansion, which involves navigating various regulatory, political, and economic risks. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource while relying on our partner ecosystem for implementation services. The ongoing pandemic may also heighten other risks, including significant volatility in global markets and changes in customer purchasing decisions. We continue to monitor the actual and potential effects of the pandemic across our business and remain committed to adapting our strategies to ensure resilience and long-term success.

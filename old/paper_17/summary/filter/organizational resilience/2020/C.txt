During 2020, Citi demonstrated solid performance as well as financial strength and operational resilience, despite a significant deterioration in public health and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Citi's revenues were largely unchanged from the prior year, as strong performance in fixed income markets, equity markets, investment banking, and the private bank offset the impact of lower interest rates and reduced customer activity in global consumer banking. Citi's expenses reflected continued investments in its transformation, including infrastructure supporting its risk and control environment, which are critical for maintaining operational flexibility and resilience. The economic outlook for 2021 reflects continued challenges and uncertainties related to the pandemic, which have created a more volatile operating environment that will continue to negatively impact Citi's businesses and results. Citi's organizational response to the pandemic has been governed by its executive management team and driven through regional task forces, focusing on the implementation of continuity of business plans and responses to customer needs. Throughout the crisis, Citi has worked closely with U.S. authorities and host governments on implementing immediate policy responses and financial assistance structures to mitigate systemic impacts. Citi has maintained strong capital and liquidity positions with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 11.7% and a supplementary leverage ratio of 7.0%, both well above regulatory minimums. The bank's dedicated continuity of business and crisis management groups are managing protocols in response to the pandemic, ensuring the safety and well-being of staff while maintaining high levels of client servicing. Citi's proactive measures include reconfiguring work environments and providing additional health resources for colleagues. The bank has also offered a wide array of short- and medium-term relief programs to customers impacted by the pandemic, demonstrating its commitment to supporting clients and communities. The allowance for credit losses increased significantly, reflecting a deterioration in Citi's macroeconomic outlook and an adjustment to reflect potential stress and slower economic recovery. The organizational transformation effort includes compliance with consent orders from regulatory bodies, which require Citi to strengthen its risk management and internal controls. Citi's response strategies to the pandemic have involved significant resource allocation to ensure operational continuity and adaptability in a challenging environment. The bank's ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes has been critical in maintaining its organizational health and effectiveness. As a result of these efforts, Citi has been able to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite the adversities faced during the year.

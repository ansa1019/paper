The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global, regional, and U.S. economic and geopolitical conditions, which can adversely impact its business and operating results. The company is exposed to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, including instability in political or economic conditions, intergovernmental conflicts, and interruptions to business with customers, distributors, and suppliers. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions, impacting manufacturing facilities and the supply chain, with expectations that these disruptions may continue. The company has transitioned a significant subset of its employee population to a remote work environment to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, which may exacerbate certain risks, including increased demand for information technology resources and cybersecurity threats. The company continues to take actions to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the health and well-being of employees and the overall business. The extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact the company’s business and financial results is dependent on various uncertain factors, including government regulations and the overall impact on the global economy. The company has established policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these policies will be effective in preventing legal violations that could disrupt operations and harm reputation. The company’s ability to generate cash from operating activities is a fundamental financial strength, and it has consistently generated operating cash flow, which is used to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends. The company believes that its global presence is an important competitive advantage, allowing it to provide quality products on a timely basis to multinational customers. The company’s strategy includes providing comprehensive design capabilities and a broad selection of products while maintaining productivity improvement and cost control programs. The company’s operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including those governing performance of government contracts, which may expose it to significant liabilities. The company has experienced difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels, which could adversely affect its business. The company’s results have been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates, and it manages currency exposure risk through various strategies. The company has also faced challenges related to the acceptance of new product introductions for continued revenue growth, and its long-term results depend on its ability to innovate and meet market demands. The company has pursued strategic acquisitions and investments as part of its growth strategy, although it acknowledges the risks associated with integrating newly acquired businesses. The company’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in tax laws, economic conditions, and other external factors, emphasizing the need for effective risk management and strategic adaptation to maintain resilience in a turbulent business environment.

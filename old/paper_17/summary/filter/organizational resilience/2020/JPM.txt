JPMorgan Chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology, and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. The effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase's operational systems and those of other market participants is crucial, as the businesses rely on the ability to process, record, monitor, and report a large number of transactions continuously and accurately. The firm faces risks associated with its dependence on operational systems, including potential disruptions from cyber attacks, which could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients. The ability to respond effectively to a business interruption could be hampered if the workforce, physical assets, or systems needed to address the event are geographically dispersed or concentrated. Furthermore, the firm recognizes that emergency or catastrophic events, such as severe weather conditions or health emergencies, could have significant and long-lasting disruptive effects on its operations and those of its clients and customers. There is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase's resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks or that they will be adequate to address simultaneous occurrences of multiple catastrophes. The firm is also subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which could result in higher compliance costs and restrictions on its operations. The operational effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase is influenced by the competence and integrity of its employees, as well as those of external parties on which its operations depend. The firm must comply with complex and evolving laws governing the privacy and protection of personal information, and any failure in this regard could expose it to litigation or regulatory fines. The ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success, and unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect its operations. Additionally, the firm faces significant legal risks from litigation and regulatory investigations, which could materially and adversely affect its business and reputation. The economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments and other external pressures, which could lead to slower growth rates, rising inflation, or recession. The firm’s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk, and any inadequacy could expose it to unexpected losses. JPMorgan Chase's operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of external operational systems. The firm’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is complex and could result in litigation and enforcement actions. Damage to JPMorgan Chase's reputation could arise from various factors, including employee misconduct, security breaches, and compliance failures. The firm recognizes that maintaining trust is critical to attracting and retaining clients and customers, and any reputational harm could significantly impact its business prospects.

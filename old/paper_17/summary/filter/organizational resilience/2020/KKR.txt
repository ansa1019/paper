Investing in our securities involves risk, and our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by difficult market and economic conditions, including those caused by external pressures such as the global outbreak of COVID-19. Such conditions can reduce the value or performance of the investments we manage and affect our ability to raise or deploy capital. We have attempted to mitigate known risks, but we can provide no assurance that our efforts will be successful. The economic downturn caused by COVID-19 may be prolonged and extend beyond the pandemic itself, impacting our business continuity and operational flexibility. We have implemented various initiatives intended to reduce the impact of COVID-19, such as employees working remotely from home while seeking to maintain business continuity. The scale and scope of the pandemic may heighten potential adverse effects on our financial performance and operating results. We are monitoring developments relating to COVID-19 and assessing the potential for adverse impacts on our business and the portfolio companies owned by us and our funds. 

Challenging market and economic conditions may also reduce opportunities for our funds to make, exit, and realize value from their investments. The ability to realize investments may be negatively impacted by declines in equity, debt, and commodity markets, which could lead to diminished or no carried interest. Our profitability may also be adversely affected by fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in net income. Unfavorable market conditions may make it difficult for us to find suitable investments or secure financing on attractive terms. 

Our business is subject to extensive regulation, and any changes in the regulatory framework could materially and adversely affect our operations. We rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information in our computer systems and networks, and we face various security threats, including cyber-security threats that could disrupt our business operations. The reliance on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our business introduces additional risks, as any failure in their performance could negatively affect our operations. 

We are committed to maintaining a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration and inclusiveness, which is essential for achieving our business objectives. Our ability to effectively manage our changing enterprise and maintain our organizational culture is crucial for our competitive advantage. The operational risks we face may disrupt our businesses, result in losses, or limit our growth. 

Our liquidity needs are significant and involve capital that will remain invested for extended periods. We expect to continue to grow our businesses by increasing assets under management and pursuing new investment strategies, which may involve entering new geographic markets. However, we face numerous risks and uncertainties in executing these strategies, including the need to manage the complexities of new investment strategies and the potential for adverse regulatory changes. 

The performance of our funds and our ability to raise additional or successor funds could be materially adversely affected by the performance of our existing funds. We may also experience fluctuations in our results due to changes in the values of our funds' investments, which are significantly impacted by global financial markets. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and manage risks effectively is vital for maintaining operational continuity and achieving organizational resilience.

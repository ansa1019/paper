In response to the oil market downturn that began in early 2020, the company established a framework for evaluating its assets and implementing economic production curtailments, which resulted in voluntarily curtailing production predominantly from operated North American assets. The actions taken included a reduction in the 2020 operating plan capital expenditures by $2.3 billion and a reduction in operating costs by $600 million, collectively representing a reduction in cash uses of approximately $5 billion versus the original operating plan. The company entered 2020 in a position of relative strength, with cash and cash equivalents of more than $5 billion, short-term investments of $3 billion, and an undrawn credit facility of $6 billion, totaling approximately $14 billion in available liquidity. This strong balance sheet allowed the company to be measured in its response to the sudden change in the business environment. The workforce and operations adjusted to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, implementing measures to protect employees and ensure business continuity. The company transitioned to a remote work environment and implemented rigorous cleaning and disinfecting processes, which have been effective at reducing business operation disruptions. The marketing and supply chain functions adapted in response to COVID-19, managing transportation commitments during the voluntary curtailment program and proactively working with vendors to ensure continuity of business operations. The company enhanced its focus on counterparty risk monitoring during this period and requested credit assurances when applicable. The company’s operational flexibility and adaptability were demonstrated through its ability to curtail production and manage costs effectively in a volatile market. The acquisition of Concho Resources Inc. was completed on January 15, 2021, which is expected to capture approximately $750 million of annual cost and capital savings by 2022. The integration of Concho’s operations is anticipated to enhance the company’s resilience and operational capabilities. The company’s commitment to safety and environmental stewardship remains a priority, with ongoing efforts to manage risks associated with environmental regulations. The company has adopted a Paris-aligned climate risk framework, aiming to reduce gross operated emissions intensity by 35 to 45 percent from 2016 levels by 2030, with an ambition to achieve net zero by 2050. The company recognizes the importance of maintaining organizational health and resilience through strategic initiatives that focus on free cash flow generation, a strong balance sheet, and operational management. The ongoing evaluation of its asset portfolio and capital allocation strategies reflects the company’s commitment to adaptability and responsiveness to external pressures and market conditions. The company’s operational management strategies, including the assessment of risks related to commodity price fluctuations and the implementation of cost control measures, further demonstrate its focus on organizational resilience in a challenging business environment.

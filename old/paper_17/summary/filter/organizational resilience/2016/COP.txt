The energy landscape remained challenged throughout 2016, with ongoing uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of a price recovery causing us to take actions early in the year to mitigate the impacts of possible prolonged weak prices. We reduced our quarterly dividend, issued long-term debt, obtained a term loan, reduced capital expenditures and production and operating expenses, and streamlined our portfolio. Our capital expenditures in 2016 were significantly reduced compared with prior years, and we progressed our efforts to high-grade our portfolio. We believe we have taken prudent actions to position the company for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility. Our value proposition principles include maintaining a strong balance sheet, growing our dividend, and pursuing disciplined growth, which are essential for organizational resilience. We established clear priorities for allocating future cash flows, including investing capital to maintain production volumes and pay dividends, reducing debt, and investing in growth. Our operational priorities include maintaining capital discipline and optimizing our portfolio by focusing on low-cost assets that fit our development plans. We strive to conduct our business with respect for the environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable growth. The exploration and production of oil and gas is a highly competitive industry, and our ability to control costs and expenses is critical to maintaining a competitive position, particularly in a low commodity price environment. We continuously evaluate potential solutions to leverage knowledge of technological successes across our operations, enabling us to achieve greater operating efficiencies and reduce our environmental impact. Our management team is committed to developing and retaining a talented workforce with the necessary skills to implement our business strategy. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices and regulatory environments, is vital for our organizational health and long-term success. Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, and compliance with these regulations is essential for maintaining operational continuity. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our sustainability efforts focus on climate change, biodiversity, and human rights, and we are committed to building a learning organization that pursues improved health, safety, and operational performance. We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement in navigating complex situations and enhancing our resilience strategies. The ability to foresee and confront challenges, including environmental disruptions and market volatility, is critical for our organizational survival and success. We are continuously assessing our operational capabilities and resource management strategies to ensure we can respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. Our commitment to strategic foresight and proactive measures enables us to adapt to the evolving business environment and sustain our competitive advantage.

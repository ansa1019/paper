The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. General or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, or earthquakes, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance, resulting in physical damage to our properties, closure of stores, and disruption in the supply of products. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located outside the U.S. Political and economic instability in the countries where our suppliers are located could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Disruptions in our primary and secondary information systems could harm our ability to conduct operations, and any interruption may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business, and disruptions could arise from power outages, computer failures, or cyber-attacks. Our ability to attract and retain qualified associates is critical for maintaining service quality and operational continuity. The retail business is highly competitive, and failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures could materially adversely affect our financial performance. We plan to increase investments in e-commerce, technology, and customer initiatives to adapt to changing consumer preferences and shopping patterns. The success of this strategy will depend on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across physical and digital retail channels. We face risks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced, including disruptions in transportation and compliance with safety standards. Our operations are subject to legislative, judicial, legal, regulatory, tax, political, and economic risks that could materially adversely affect our business. We are also subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that may adversely affect our financial performance. Our business strategy for international operations includes opening new units and growing comparable store sales, which depends on our ability to locate, hire, and retain qualified personnel. Our ability to effectively respond to environmental disruptions and transform operations to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical for organizational resilience. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in competitors' operations. The potential imposition of new trade tariffs could increase costs and adversely affect our financial performance. We have in place substantial security measures to protect our information systems, but cyber threats are evolving, and breaches could materially affect our business and reputation. Our ability to maintain operational flexibility and adapt to unexpected situations is essential for sustaining performance under pressure and ensuring organizational survival.

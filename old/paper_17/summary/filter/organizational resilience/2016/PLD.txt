Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business internationally, which exposes us to external pressures such as political instability, economic cycles, and compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws. Disruptions in global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting our ability to make principal and interest payments on debt and affecting customer leasing transactions. Our business could suffer from system failures or cyber security attacks, despite implementing security measures and maintaining a disaster recovery plan. The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business, as we depend on their deep industry knowledge and efforts. Deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting may result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements. We are subject to risks associated with our dependence on foreign currencies, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, which may expose us to economic downturns in that sector more than if our business were more diversified. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually and may elect to self-insure based on industry analysis. Our real estate investments are subject to various risks, including local conditions, technological changes, and governmental regulations. Our operating performance is impacted by economic conditions in the specific markets where we own properties, and we may experience adverse effects from conditions such as oversupply or reduced demand for logistics space. We maintain a focus on maintaining operational flexibility and strategic initiatives to adapt to changing market conditions. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from co-investment ventures, and property dispositions is essential for meeting our anticipated future development and acquisition needs. We expect to fund our cash needs from various sources, including fees earned for services performed on behalf of co-investment ventures and proceeds from property dispositions. Our strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset management and other fees, which fluctuate based on the size of co-investment ventures under management. We believe our organizational practices and the expertise of our team provide us with competitive advantages that enhance our resilience in the face of market volatility. Our financial condition and operating results are influenced by our ability to manage risks effectively and maintain operational continuity. We continuously review our operational management strategies to enhance our adaptability and ensure we can confront unexpected situations. The potential impacts of future climate change and environmental risks are also considered in our operational planning and risk management strategies. We recognize the importance of maintaining a strong balance sheet and the ability to respond strategically to market demands and pressures.

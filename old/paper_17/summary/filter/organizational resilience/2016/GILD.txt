In evaluating our business, we note that a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of products to treat HCV and HIV, and if we are unable to increase HIV sales or if HCV sales decrease more than anticipated, then our results of operations may be adversely affected. The primary driver of our HCV product revenues is patient starts, followed by market share, average treatment duration, and price. We expect patient starts to decline relative to 2016 in all major markets, resulting in a decline in HCV revenues. Revenue per patient may also decline due to increased competition and pricing pressures, a larger than anticipated shift in our payer mix to more highly discounted payer segments, and a decrease in the average duration of treatment. Future sales of our products are difficult to estimate because demand depends, in part, on reimbursement levels by private and government payers. We may continue to experience global pricing pressure, which could result in larger discounts or rebates on our products or delayed reimbursement, negatively impacting our product sales and results of operations. We expect pricing pressure in the HCV market to continue, and any change in formulary coverage, reimbursement levels, or discounts offered on our HCV products may impact our anticipated revenues. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HCV or HIV products for various reasons, including potential safety issues, reduced reimbursement, and competition from new products. Our operations depend on compliance with complex regulations, and failure to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products. We face significant competition from large global pharmaceutical companies and generic drug manufacturers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our reliance on collaborative relationships poses risks, including the possibility that our partners may pursue competing technologies or devote fewer resources to our products. We also rely on third-party contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials, and any disputes or disruptions in these relationships could delay our clinical trials. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to defend our patents and other intellectual property rights, as litigation could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to various legal actions that require us to expend substantial internal and financial resources, which could harm our business. Our worldwide operations could be subject to business interruptions stemming from natural or man-made disasters, and we may not carry adequate insurance to cover such events. We are dependent upon information technology systems, and cyberattacks could adversely affect our business and operations. Our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock will depend on our cash balances and potential future capital requirements. We believe our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash flows from operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on various factors, including the commercial performance of our products, the progress of our R&D efforts, and the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or new products. We may require additional funding in the future, which could be in the form of equity or debt financings.

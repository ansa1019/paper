We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands, and failure to preserve their value could negatively impact our financial results. Business incidents that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us, and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience. We also source our food, beverage, and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners, and our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses could harm our business, and any report linking us to such issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales. We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability, integrity, and capacity of these systems. We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. Factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives include increases in labor costs, increasing competition, delays in store openings, and the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms. Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new channels and international markets. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, and a slowdown or decline in this segment could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business. We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets to achieve our growth targets, and the performance of these operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns. We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. Our operating results are subject to various factors, including adverse outcomes of litigation, labor discord, political instability, and natural disasters. Any material interruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and profitability. We rely on suppliers and vendors to provide high-quality products and to comply with applicable laws, and any failure to meet our standards could negatively impact our business. Our ability to find qualified suppliers is a significant challenge, especially for goods sourced from outside the U.S. We must continue to recruit, retain, and motivate management and other employees to maintain our current business and execute our strategic initiatives. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and failure to comply could harm our business and financial results.

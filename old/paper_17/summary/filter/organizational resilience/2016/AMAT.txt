The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied's business, financial condition, or results of operations, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company. As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length, and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. These industries have historically been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend on several factors, including general economic conditions and technology transitions. To meet rapidly changing demand, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses. During periods of increasing demand, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand, effectively manage its supply chain, and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges, its business performance may be adversely impacted. Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy, which may cause customers to push out or cancel orders, adversely impacting revenues and financial condition. Economic uncertainty may also affect suppliers, impairing their ability to deliver parts and negatively affecting Applied's operations. The industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes that impact demand and profitability, including the increasing importance of establishing and maintaining strong relationships with customers and the need for customers to continually reduce manufacturing costs. Applied must also adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain and implement changes in its design engineering methodology to improve product life cycle management. The ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is vital to Applied's success, and achieving this objective may be difficult due to global competition for talent and fluctuations in economic conditions. Restructuring programs present challenges, particularly involving the departure of knowledgeable employees, which may result in unexpected costs and reduced productivity. Applied's success depends significantly on the protection of its intellectual property rights, and any infringement could result in lost market opportunities. Applied is also exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats, which could result in business disruption and reputational damage. The company engages in acquisitions and strategic investments, which involve numerous risks, including the failure to realize expected returns and the ineffective integration of operations. Applied must continue to invest in research and development to maintain a competitive advantage and support its customers, which can negatively impact operating margins. The ability to manage operational resources effectively is crucial, particularly during periods of changing demand, and Applied must implement comprehensive programs to enhance its supply chain and improve operational efficiencies. If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, it may experience operational difficulties and increased costs, adversely affecting its business and financial condition.

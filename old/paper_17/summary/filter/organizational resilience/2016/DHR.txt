The company is subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, and changes in laws, which may impair its business, including results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. The business is sensitive to general economic conditions, and slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated defaults on sovereign debt, and volatility in currency and credit markets may adversely affect the company. The company’s growth depends in part on the growth of the markets it serves, and visibility into these markets is limited. The company faces intense competition, and if it is unable to compete effectively, it may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. Significant shifts in industry market share can occur in connection with product problems, reflecting the competitive significance of product quality and efficacy. The company must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow by establishing relationships with new customers while developing new products and services to maintain its brand recognition and leadership position. The company’s success will depend on its ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences, allocate research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects, and anticipate and respond to competitors' innovations. The company’s operations are also subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect its reputation and financial statements. The company continually assesses the strategic fit of its existing businesses and may divest or dispose of businesses that do not fit with its strategic plan. The company relies on its suppliers to adhere to its standards of conduct, and material violations could have a material effect on its business and reputation. The company’s operations, products, and services expose it to environmental, health, and safety liabilities, costs, and violations that could adversely affect its business. The company is also exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. The company’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area may have on its operating profit. The company’s financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities used in its operations, and any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect its business. The company has implemented significant restructuring activities across its businesses to adjust its cost structure, which could slow improvements in products and services and limit its ability to respond to customers. The company’s ability to grow revenues depends in part upon its ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. The company’s operations are subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing, and sales and marketing practices, and failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in significant legal and investigatory fees. The company’s defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its financial statements. The company’s operations, products, and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply could result in civil and criminal penalties. The company’s ability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls is critical to its operations, and any significant disruption could adversely affect its business.

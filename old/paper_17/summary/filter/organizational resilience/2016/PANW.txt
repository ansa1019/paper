Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to our ability to effectively manage future growth and improve our systems, processes, and controls. The growth and expansion of our business place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. To manage future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. Failure to manage future growth could result in increased costs, disrupt existing customer relationships, and harm our business performance. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could adversely affect our financial condition. We may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls, or in connection with third-party software licensed to assist with such improvements. Additionally, our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and services is influenced by various external pressures, including changes in customer requirements and market needs. 

The global macroeconomic environment has been inconsistent and challenging, which may cause our end-customers to modify spending priorities or delay purchasing decisions, resulting in lengthened sales cycles. Our future success depends on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing end-customers, which may require increasingly sophisticated sales efforts. Furthermore, our growth strategy is dependent on increasing sales of our products to medium and large enterprise end-customers, which involves risks such as competition from larger vendors and the need to meet more stringent requirements. 

We rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and services will be limited. The enterprise security market is evolving rapidly, and our ability to predict end-customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends is critical. If we fail to manage product introductions and transitions effectively, our competitive position could be harmed. 

Our corporate culture fosters innovation, teamwork, and knowledge sharing, which are vital for our success and ability to retain highly skilled personnel. However, as we grow, maintaining these aspects of our culture may become challenging. We must also navigate risks associated with acquisitions, as integrating new companies and technologies requires significant management attention and resources. 

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and any failure to comply could result in reputational damage and financial penalties. Our business is also subject to risks from catastrophic events, including natural disasters and geopolitical unrest, which could disrupt our operations and supply chain. Effective risk management strategies are essential for maintaining operational continuity and organizational resilience in the face of these challenges.

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and we have identified risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. Our business could be harmed by these risks, including unforeseen operating expenses and difficulties that may result in increased costs. We may encounter challenges in predicting customer demand for our products and the entry of competitive products, which could adversely affect our ability to generate cash flow from operations. The successful entry into new markets is critical to our revenue growth prospects, and our ability to address these markets depends on various factors, including the effectiveness of our marketing and sales personnel. If we are unable to develop and implement new products in a timely manner, our revenue growth rate and operating results will be adversely affected. Cybersecurity events pose significant risks, as they may lead to loss of customers and substantial liabilities, impacting our operational continuity and overall performance. Disruptions or defects in our services could damage our reputation and financial results, and we may experience lengthy interruptions due to factors beyond our control, such as natural disasters or cybersecurity threats. Our operations are vulnerable to external pressures, including environmental disruptions and geopolitical instability, which may affect our ability to deliver services and meet customer needs. We recognize the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in response to these challenges. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is crucial for our success, and competition for skilled employees in the technology industry is intense. The loss of key employees could significantly impact our business and operational effectiveness. We are also subject to evolving regulations regarding data privacy and cloud computing, which may impose additional operational constraints and affect our ability to provide services globally. Our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles and tax laws, which could impact our operational management and resource allocation. We face risks associated with international sales, including compliance with foreign regulations and the potential for increased operational costs. Our business strategy includes continuous enhancement of our products and services to meet changing customer expectations, and we must effectively manage our resources to sustain growth. The occurrence of legal settlements and the associated costs may also impact our financial condition. We must remain vigilant in assessing risks and implementing strategies to mitigate potential adverse effects on our organizational resilience and overall performance.

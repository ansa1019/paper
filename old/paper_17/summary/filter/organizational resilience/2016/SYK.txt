This report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition, and liquidity. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We face uncertainties that might result from modifications or repeal of provisions of the Affordable Care Act, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of our products, and failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may lead to sanctions that could adversely affect our operational continuity. We may experience interruptions in manufacturing operations that could adversely affect our business. Our reliance on certain suppliers exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices, which may impact our ability to meet customer demand. We are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices, which could affect our organizational resilience. We rely on information technology systems to conduct business, and numerous evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our IT systems, networks, and services. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, we may be exposed to reputational and business harm. We are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system, and any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design and implementation could adversely affect our ability to operate our business effectively. Our ability to attract and retain key employees is critical for meeting our strategic business objectives, and failure to do so may impair our organizational capabilities. We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions, which are inherently risky and could have a material unfavorable impact on us. Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our extensive international operations in an increasingly volatile environment. We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and ready access to capital markets at competitive rates. Our overall cash position reflects our strong business results and a global cash management strategy that considers liquidity management and economic factors. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from various sources, including cash from operations and existing credit lines. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in our impairment testing could result in significantly different estimates of fair values, potentially leading to impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations. We are involved in various ongoing legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, and the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.

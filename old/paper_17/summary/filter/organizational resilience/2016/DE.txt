The following risks are considered the most significant to John Deere's business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions. These risk factors could affect particular lines of business and could impair John Deere's profitability and growth prospects. International, national, and regional trade laws, regulations, and policies could significantly impair John Deere's ability to export goods and services and access raw materials at competitive prices. Trade restrictions may limit John Deere's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and could affect its competitive position. Additionally, John Deere's competitive position could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. trade policy. The ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deere's customers, and policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices could have a material adverse effect on the demand for agricultural equipment. John Deere's operations and results could also be impacted by financial regulatory reform that could adversely affect its financial services segment. John Deere's business may be directly and indirectly affected by unfavorable weather conditions or natural disasters that reduce agricultural production and demand for equipment. Supply chain disruptions due to supplier financial distress or natural disaster events could affect John Deere's operations and profitability. John Deere's operations must comply with increasingly rigorous environmental, health, and safety laws, and enforcement actions arising from violations could result in significant fines or penalties. The company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secret laws to protect its intellectual property rights, and violations could have a material adverse effect on the company. John Deere's ability to execute its strategy is dependent upon attracting, training, and retaining qualified personnel. The company strives to reduce the impact of employee departures, as the loss of personnel could impair its ability to execute its business strategy. The financial services segment's liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital, and negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, impacting credit applications and increasing delinquencies. Changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment and limit access to capital markets. John Deere's operations are subject to currency exchange risk, and fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could significantly impact its results. The occurrence of security breaches and disruptions to John Deere's information technology infrastructure could compromise operations and expose the company to liability. Despite security measures, John Deere's information technology networks may be vulnerable to damage or disruptions due to various threats. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection is rapidly evolving, and any inability to adequately address these concerns could result in additional costs and damage to reputation. John Deere's operations are also impacted by changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization, which could affect demand for its products. The company has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction standards, and while it does not foresee significant obstacles, these plans are subject to variables that could affect its ability to manufacture and distribute equipment.

A significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include increased use of network sharing or mergers among wireless service providers, zoning and environmental regulations, and changes in governmental licensing. The ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure are critical, as is the financial condition of these providers. Our ongoing contractual revenues and future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed. Our business is subject to government and tax regulations, and changes in laws could restrict our ability to operate as we currently do. We face risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position. Our international operations expose us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. We anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow, but we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including changes to existing laws, political or economic conditions, and compliance with various regulations. Our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those related to integrating acquired assets, which could disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends on timely and efficient integration, which may be difficult and unpredictable. If we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or utilize them to their full capacity, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing for capital expenditures and future growth initiatives. We may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities, asset sales, or equity issuances, even if market conditions are not favorable. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in their creditworthiness. If any of these tenants are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations, our revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. We rely on the continued financial strength of our tenants, many of whom operate with substantial leverage. If our tenants are unable to raise adequate capital, they may reduce their spending, which could adversely affect demand for our communications sites. Our operations are subject to various environmental and occupational safety laws, and we may be liable for substantial costs related to compliance. Our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and unforeseen events, which could impact our ability to provide services and lead to tenant loss. While we maintain insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to cover all associated costs. Our computer systems are also subject to interruptions or damage from various risks, including cyber attacks and natural disasters, which could disrupt our operations and require significant remediation costs. Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities depends on maintaining recurring revenue and minimizing operating costs. We believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with the covenants of our debt agreements.

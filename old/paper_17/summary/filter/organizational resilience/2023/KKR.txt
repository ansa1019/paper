Investing in our securities involves risk, and we may attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent practicable and reasonable, but we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. Difficult market and economic conditions can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. Geopolitical developments and other local and global events outside of our control can also materially and adversely impact various aspects of our operations. These risks have increased in scale and complexity due to intensifying geopolitical competition and conflicts, which can create new complexities in the international business environment. Natural disasters and catastrophes, including public health crises, may materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our investment management and insurance businesses. The impact of these conditions has exacerbated other risks discussed in this report, including with respect to valuations and our ability to identify, execute, and exit investments on attractive terms. Our insurance business relies on third parties to distribute its products, and any adversity with its third-party distributors could have a material adverse effect on our insurance business. We depend on the efforts, skills, reputations, and conduct of our employees, and our ability to retain and recruit prospective employees is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and achieving our business objectives. Our success is highly dependent upon our employees and other key personnel, and the loss of these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors and result in a reduction of assets under management or investment opportunities. We also face risks related to our reliance on third-party service providers, which exposes us to operational, reputational, and other risks that could materially and adversely affect us. Cybersecurity failures and data security breaches may disrupt our businesses and operations, and we are subject to risks of errors and mistakes made by these third parties. Our organizational practices must adapt to changing market conditions, and we must effectively manage financial and non-financial risks. The ability to effectively respond to unexpected situations and maintain operational flexibility is essential for organizational resilience. We may face significant challenges in managing our balance sheet commitments, and our liquidity, business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to do so. Our investment activities are subject to various risks, including the potential for significant losses in the event of adverse market conditions or disruptions. We must continuously assess and adapt our strategies to ensure resilience in the face of external pressures and challenges. The evolving preferences of our fund investors may necessitate that alternatives to traditional investment fund structures become a larger part of our business going forward, which could increase our cost of raising capital. Our organizational resilience is contingent upon our ability to navigate these complexities and maintain a focus on strategic initiatives that support growth and sustainability in a turbulent market environment.
Insurance subsidiaries may not declare a dividend in 2024 to their holding companies without prior domiciliary state regulatory approval. Offering new products or offering products in additional jurisdictions will also subject Global Atlantic to additional regulation and compliance requirements. Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulations regarding the type and concentration of investments they may make, which may limit Global Atlantic's ability to invest. If our relationships or reputation with various regulatory authorities were to deteriorate, our insurance business could be materially and adversely affected, including making it more difficult for Global Atlantic to obtain necessary consents and approvals. Global Atlantic must obtain licenses to sell insurance in other states and U.S. jurisdictions, and failure to renew requisite licenses or comply with regulatory requirements could result in suspension from conducting operations and imposition of fines. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Federal Insurance Office to monitor the insurance industry, which could lead to changes in regulation that negatively impact our insurance business. Insurance regulators have increased scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework, significantly increasing scrutiny of insurance companies strategically partnered with alternative asset managers. The cost of compliance with existing laws and regulations is high, and changes or additional regulatory requirements could adversely affect our insurance business, including restricting our ability to conduct business and comply with laws. Global Atlantic must balance overlapping and potentially conflicting regulations and accounting rules, which may change over time. The Bermuda Insurance Act requires each of our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries to maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus, satisfy solvency standards, and comply with restrictions on dividends. Failure to meet applicable requirements could subject Global Atlantic to examination or corrective action by regulators. The Bermuda insurance regulatory framework is subject to scrutiny from many jurisdictions, and any changes to capital requirements may materially increase the capital our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries must hold. Global Atlantic may need to take significant actions to avoid registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. The need to comply with the 40% test may cause us to restrict our business and subsidiaries regarding the assets in which we can invest. Our insurance business is also impacted by the need to generate cash flow from operations, including premiums and investment income, which are essential for meeting future obligations. Global Atlantic's reserves are estimated based on models that include many actuarial assumptions and projections, which are inherently uncertain and involve significant judgment. The assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves and the assumptions underlying those reserves at least annually. Changes in the fair value of investments impact the amount of carried interest recognized and the amount of investment income recognized for investments held directly and through our consolidated funds. The valuation of embedded derivatives and policy liabilities is subject to significant judgment, and changes in market conditions can have a substantial impact on these valuations.

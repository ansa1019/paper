The company's success is dependent on the successful development and marketing of new products, which are subject to substantial risks. The company faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products, and unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect its operating results. The company is dependent on its patent rights, and if these rights are invalidated or circumvented, its business could be materially adversely affected. The company has significant global operations, exposing it to additional risks, including changes in medical reimbursement policies, regulatory requirements, and foreign exchange fluctuations. The company believes that climate change has the potential to negatively affect its business and results of operations, as it is exposed to physical risks, risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and social and human effects associated with climate change. The company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure, and continues to be a target of cyber-attacks that could lead to disruptions in its operations. The company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and indications to cover substantial research and development costs and replace sales lost from products that lose market exclusivity. The company is actively pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth, including strategic business development transactions and collaborations. The company's ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of its key products, which are subject to various risks including loss of patent protection, increased manufacturing costs, and competition from generic products. The company faces challenges in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, which could affect its ability to successfully develop and commercialize products. The company has experienced difficulties in manufacturing certain products, including vaccines, which could lead to product shortages and lost sales. The company is also subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities that could affect its financial condition. The company is committed to improving its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, as stakeholders increasingly focus on ESG concerns that could impact its business and reputation. The company continues to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of associated reserves, as current or future litigation could adversely affect its business. The companyâ€™s research and development expenses reflect higher charges for business development transactions and increased development spending, particularly in therapeutic areas such as oncology and vaccines. The company anticipates that actions under its restructuring programs will result in cumulative annual net cost savings, enhancing its operational flexibility and resilience in the face of market pressures.

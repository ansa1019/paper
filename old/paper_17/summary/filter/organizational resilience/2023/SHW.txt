The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition. Adverse changes in general business and economic conditions may reduce the demand for some of our products and impair our ability to predict and meet future changes in demand. Economic downturns in cyclical segments may depress demand for our products and adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow, or financial condition. Unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow. Supply chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions, and natural disasters may temporarily reduce demand for some of our products and impact our ability to meet customer demands. Our facilities and systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to meet business needs in the event of disruptions. Catastrophic events and their impacts have resulted in industry-wide supply chain disruptions and increased costs, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, or cash flow. We continue to face elevated wage rates and intense competition for talent, which could impair our ability to meet our strategic objectives and the needs of our customers. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, including supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions. We are subject to various domestic and foreign health, safety, and environmental laws that may impose potential liability on us for past operations. Our operations are sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are also exposed to risks associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies, which may adversely affect our business. Our ability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to these factors is crucial for maintaining operational continuity and resilience. Our strategic planning includes investments in new facilities and expansions, aimed at enhancing our operational flexibility and adaptability to market changes. We have implemented various programs designed to protect the environment and promote compliance with applicable laws, which are essential for maintaining our organizational health and sustainability. The companyâ€™s financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow remained strong, enabling us to invest in capital expenditures and return value to shareholders. However, we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations. Our risk management and compliance programs are designed to mitigate risks, but the global and diverse nature of our operations means compliance risks will continue to exist. Our ability to attract, retain, develop, and progress a qualified global workforce is critical to our success and future resilience. We face significant competition from various competitors, which necessitates continuous innovation and adaptation to maintain our competitive advantage. Our organizational practices and strategic initiatives are focused on enhancing our resilience to external pressures and ensuring our ability to recover from disruptive events. The impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business, including supply chain disruptions and inflation, remains a concern for our operational effectiveness and strategic response.

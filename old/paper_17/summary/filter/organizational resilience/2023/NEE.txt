The business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects of nee and fpl are subject to a variety of risks, including regulatory, legislative, and legal risks that may materially adversely affect their operations. The extensive regulation of their business requires that nee and fpl address the effects of regulation on their business, and any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition. The operations of nee and fpl are influenced by various legislative and regulatory initiatives, which may impose new or additional limits on operations, potentially impacting their ability to recover costs or achieve acceptable returns on capital investments. The geopolitical, political, regulatory, operational, and economic environment can adversely affect regulatory decisions, which may require fpl or neer to cancel or delay planned development activities or incur costs that may not be recoverable. The ability to proceed with projects under development and complete construction of facilities on schedule is critical, as delays or cost overruns could result in significant financial impacts. The operations are also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that may increase costs and require compliance measures, which could adversely affect their business. Severe weather events and natural disasters can disrupt operations, requiring additional costs for restoration and repair, and impacting service reliability. The physical plants of nee and fpl are at risk of damage from climate-related changes, which could result in operational challenges and increased costs. The organization must also manage risks associated with cybersecurity threats and geopolitical factors that could disrupt business continuity. The ability to recover costs associated with severe weather is subject to regulatory approval, and any determination not to permit recovery could adversely affect financial performance. The organization is also exposed to credit and performance risks from customers and vendors, which could result in financial losses if counterparties fail to fulfill obligations. The reliance on sensitive information technology systems means that any failure or breach could materially affect operations. The management of operational risks is essential for maintaining organizational effectiveness, and the ability to adapt to changing market conditions is crucial for sustaining performance. The organization must also navigate the complexities of regulatory compliance, which can impose significant costs and operational constraints. The ability to maintain operational flexibility and respond effectively to environmental disruptions is vital for organizational resilience. The strategic initiatives undertaken by nee and fpl are designed to enhance their capacity to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities in a dynamic market environment.

In evaluating our business, we recognize that risks related to the macro environment, including inflation and adverse global economic conditions, could negatively affect our organizational resilience and financial condition. The uncertain economic environment may lead to churn in our customer base, reductions in revenues, and increased price competition, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Our reliance on third parties for power supply and the potential for power outages or capacity constraints could limit our operational flexibility and ability to grow. We also face risks associated with cybersecurity incidents that could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. Despite our efforts to mitigate these risks through backup generators and contracts with fuel suppliers, unplanned outages could negatively impact customer experience and revenues. The ongoing military conflicts and geopolitical events may lead to market disruptions and increased regulatory complexities, further affecting our operational resilience. We are committed to maintaining our organizational health through effective risk management strategies, including compliance with evolving global sanctions laws and adapting our processes accordingly. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs is critical for sustaining our competitive advantage. We continue to invest in our back-office information technology systems to enhance operational management and support our growth initiatives. However, difficulties or disruptions in these systems may adversely affect our business operations. Our expansion plans are subject to various risks, including construction delays and supply chain challenges, which could impede our ability to meet customer commitments and affect our financial performance. We are also focused on maintaining a balanced customer base, as failure to attract and retain key customers could harm our business. Our organizational structure is designed to enhance our operational resilience, but we face challenges in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, which could disrupt our growth. We are committed to proactive measures to ensure our business continuity and resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptive events. Our strategic initiatives include investments in joint ventures to develop capacity for hyperscale customers, which we believe will play a significant role in our future growth. We recognize that our operational continuity is critical to meeting service level commitments and maintaining customer trust. The evolving regulatory landscape, particularly regarding environmental sustainability and cybersecurity, presents additional challenges that we must navigate to ensure compliance and operational resilience. Our ability to manage these complexities and implement effective response strategies will be essential for our organizational success in a rapidly changing business environment.

The organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical. We continuously assess the evolving situation in various markets, including geopolitical disruptions, which could significantly impact our business operations. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards might not always be effective to fully mitigate the impact of disruptions, such as those caused by the global pandemic outbreak of COVID-19, which created significant societal and economic disruption. The conflict in Ukraine has heightened the likelihood of supply chain disruptions, potentially inhibiting our ability to timely source materials and services needed to manufacture and sell our products. We are continuously monitoring this fluid situation and developing contingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop. The impact of geopolitical disruptions could cause significant volume declines in our duty-free business and other key markets, disrupt or delay our distribution, manufacturing, or supply chain, and lead to loss of property or equipment critical to our business. Our ability to recover from adverse situations is influenced by our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives aimed at maintaining organizational health. We recognize the importance of adapting to changing market conditions and consumer preferences, which may be influenced by economic uncertainties and regulatory changes. Our efforts to innovate and transform into a consumer-centric business are essential for achieving our strategic goals and ensuring organizational survival. The integration of acquired businesses, such as Swedish Match and Vectura Fertin Pharma, is part of our strategy to enhance our resilience and adapt to market demands. We face significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements, which could impede our ability to effectively respond to market pressures. The success of our reduced-risk products is contingent upon our ability to advocate for science-based regulatory frameworks and to manage compliance with various legal and regulatory requirements. Our financial performance is subject to risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our results, including the unpredictability of our new product categories and the competitive landscape. We must effectively allocate resources and manage operational risks to maintain our competitive advantage. The evolving nature of our business environment necessitates a focus on strategic resilience, ensuring that we can confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes. Our organizational capabilities, including knowledge management and strategic foresight, are vital for navigating complex situations and enhancing our adaptability. We are committed to fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration, which will support our long-term growth ambitions and enable us to flourish in a turbulent market.

The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition that may reduce our profits. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our network reliability, speed, capacity, coverage, pricing of our products and services, quality of customer service, and our development of new and enhanced products and services. We must adapt to future changes in technology and enhance our existing offerings to address our customers' changing demands. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending, which could negatively affect the affordability and demand for our products and services. Adverse economic conditions may amplify other risk factors, including our competitive position and margins. We are implementing measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, and other disruptive events, but these measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business operations are subject to interruption by various factors, including cyber attacks, which could have an adverse effect on our business. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks require ongoing monitoring and updating. We believe that our reputation and brands significantly contribute to our success, and damage to our reputation could undermine customer confidence and reduce demand for our products and services. Public health crises could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are focused on enhancing our networks, maintaining a high-quality customer base, and delivering strong financial and operating results. Our strategy requires significant capital investments to evolve and maintain our networks and develop advanced information technology systems. We expect future service revenue growth opportunities to arise from increased access revenue as customer demand for mobile connectivity continues to expand. We also expect to support connection growth by adding capacity and further expanding our wireless coverage. Our overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into consideration risk and return. We are subject to various regulatory frameworks that could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. Changes in the regulatory framework may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from ongoing audits and tax controversies, which could materially impact our financial performance. Our ability to generate cash flows will benefit from expected service revenue growth and anticipated reductions in capital expenditures. We expect to continue to invest in our wireless networks and advanced technologies to position ourselves at the center of growth trends for the future. Our capital expenditures are primarily focused on enhancing the operating efficiency and productivity of our networks, maintaining our existing infrastructure, and facilitating the introduction of new products and services. We are committed to maintaining operational continuity and flexibility in response to changing market conditions and customer needs.

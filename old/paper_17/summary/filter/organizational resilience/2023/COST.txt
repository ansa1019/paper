The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly through our dependence on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations. Disruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction, highlighting the importance of operational continuity. Our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks associated with slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales, negative trends in operating expenses, and failing to meet targets for warehouse openings. We face significant competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The retail business is highly competitive, and our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results. 

Natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as they may result in physical damage to our properties, limitations on store operating hours, and disruptions to our IT systems. Our e-commerce operations depend heavily on third-party and in-house logistics providers, and any failure to maintain membership growth, loyalty, and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations. The effectiveness of our investments in supply chains and delivery channels can be unpredictable, emphasizing the need for strategic initiatives that enhance resilience. 

We are undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects, and the failure of these projects could adversely impact our business plans and potentially impair our day-to-day operations. Given the high volume of transactions we process, it is important to build strong digital resiliency to prevent disruption from events such as power outages and cybersecurity threats. Increased security threats and sophisticated cyber misconduct pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, and services, and the potential impacts of a cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, and disruption to systems and operations. 

Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs, and while we have achieved successes in this area, significant costs are partially outside our control. We must attract, train, and retain highly qualified employees, and failure to do so could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Claims for employee health care benefits and other exposures are funded predominantly through self-insurance, and significant claims or events could adversely impact our financial condition. 

We are subject to risks associated with legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political, and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business. The emergence, severity, magnitude, and duration of global or regional health crises are uncertain and difficult to predict, and such crises could affect our business operations, demand for our products, and financial performance. The ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive change is critical for survival and growth, and we must continuously adapt our strategies to maintain operational flexibility and resilience in a turbulent market environment.

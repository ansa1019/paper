This report contains statements that are considered "forward-looking statements" and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We rely on certain suppliers for raw materials and components, exposing us to product shortages and price increases, which could adversely impact our competitive position and operational continuity. The ability to manage supply chain disruptions is critical to maintaining our operational flexibility and responding effectively to environmental disruptions. We have experienced challenges due to inflationary pressures and supply chain inefficiencies, which could materially affect our profitability and results of operations. Our reliance on indirect distribution channels and major distributors poses additional risks, as their insolvency or failure to adhere to requirements could impact our ability to market and sell our products. We are subject to risks associated with our extensive global operations, including geopolitical conflicts and changes in regulatory requirements, which could adversely affect our ability to manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. The implementation of a new commercial global enterprise resource planning system is a significant undertaking that could disrupt our operations if not managed effectively. We must also attract, develop, and retain key personnel to meet our strategic business objectives, as labor shortages and increased competition for talent could hinder our organizational capabilities. The loss of senior management or key personnel could impair our ability to execute our business strategy. Our manufacturing operations are concentrated in specific geographic regions, and any damage to these facilities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand. The impacts of pandemics and public health emergencies have previously disrupted our operations and could do so again in the future. Our ability to respond to these challenges and maintain operational continuity is crucial for organizational resilience. We are also subject to various legal and regulatory risks that could result in significant penalties or sanctions, impacting our operational effectiveness. Changes in tax laws and regulations could affect our financial condition, and we must navigate complex tax environments across multiple jurisdictions. Our corporate responsibility practices are increasingly scrutinized, and failure to meet evolving expectations could harm our reputation and business performance. The physical effects of climate change and associated regulatory measures could adversely impact our operations and supply chain. We are committed to managing these risks through strategic initiatives and investments in innovation, which are essential for sustaining competitive advantage and ensuring long-term organizational health.

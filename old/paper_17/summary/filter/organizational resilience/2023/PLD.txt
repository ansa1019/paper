Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including social, geopolitical, and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside of the U.S., and circumstances related to international operations could negatively impact us. Difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, local business and cultural factors, volatility in currencies, and challenges in establishing effective controls may disrupt our business continuity. Changes in regulatory and environmental requirements, economic downturns, and political instability may also affect our ability to adapt and respond effectively to external pressures. Our workforce may face challenges such as illness or the need to work remotely, which could create inefficiencies and delays in our operations. Prolonged economic downturns or public health crises may impact our ability to access capital markets and complete real estate transactions at attractive pricing. We are required to comply with various regulations, and noncompliance could result in fines or damages, affecting our organizational health. Disruptions in global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting the value of our properties and our ability to make principal and interest payments. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, exposing us to economic downturns in that sector. We seek to minimize risks through geographic diversification and market research, but local conditions, technological changes, and governmental regulations may still affect our business. Our ability to recover investments may be impacted by market conditions, and increases in material costs due to labor shortages and supply chain disruptions may make property development more costly. We depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our performance. Our credit ratings influence our ability to access capital on favorable terms, and adverse changes could negatively impact our refinancing and growth activities. We are exposed to risks associated with debt financing, including the potential insufficiency of cash flow to meet required payments. Our ability to maintain operational continuity and respond strategically to market conditions is critical for our organizational resilience. We evaluate our business operations based on net operating income, which helps us understand our performance and adapt to changing market dynamics. Our strategic capital segment includes revenues from asset management and property management services, which fluctuate based on portfolio size and market conditions. We believe our properties and those of our co-investment ventures are adequately insured, although certain losses may not be fully covered. Our business could be adversely impacted by system failures or cybersecurity attacks, which may disrupt operations and incur additional costs. We carry insurance coverage for various risks, but certain losses, including those from floods and earthquakes, may not be fully insured. Our liquidity and capital resources are considered adequate to meet anticipated future development, acquisition, and operational needs, although we may need to rely on external sources of capital.

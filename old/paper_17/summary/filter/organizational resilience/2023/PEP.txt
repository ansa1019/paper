The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has resulted in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, leading to volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents, and business disruptions, including labor shortages. These factors could adversely affect our ability to manage operations and achieve sustainability goals. Demand for our products depends on our ability to innovate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, which continuously evolve due to various factors, including changes in demographics and consumption patterns. Our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by geopolitical events, natural disasters, and other events beyond our control, which could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues.

Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products, and our brand image has been adversely impacted by various factors, including failures in ethical practices and compliance with environmental, social, and governance goals. Damage to our reputation can lead to reduced demand for our products, adversely affecting our business. Our ability to attract, develop, and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce is essential for operational continuity and competitive advantage. Challenges in the labor market, including wage inflation and labor shortages, can deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage.

Our business is also impacted by climate change, which may increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, impairing our production capabilities and disrupting our supply chain. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, leading to significant costs and necessitating additional investments in facilities and equipment. We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions aimed at achieving net-zero emissions and becoming net water positive, which requires collaboration across our value chain.

The achievement of our strategic and operational objectives involves risks that evolve over time. We leverage an integrated risk management framework that includes oversight by our board and senior management to assess and mitigate these risks. The board and relevant committees receive updates on enterprise risk management issues, including cybersecurity, sustainability, and supply chain inflation. Our risk management processes are designed to identify, assess, prioritize, and address strategic, financial, operational, compliance, and reputational risks.

In the context of our productivity initiatives, we continue to implement measures aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiencies. However, these initiatives may result in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions and increased employee turnover. Our reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems also poses risks that could adversely affect our business if these providers fail to meet their obligations. The complexity of our operations requires effective coordination and communication across various departments and teams to ensure resilience in the face of challenges.

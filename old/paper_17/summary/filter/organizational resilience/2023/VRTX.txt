Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and we invest significant resources in the research, development, manufacturing, and supply of therapies for serious diseases. Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the ability to successfully develop and commercialize additional products, which could materially harm our business. We face risks related to pricing, government regulation, and the commercialization of our products, which may affect our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to changing market conditions. Our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends on engaging in transactions and collaborations that add to our pipeline or provide new commercial opportunities. We rely on third-party manufacturers and logistics providers, and any disruptions in these relationships could impact our operational flexibility and ability to respond to external pressures. Our success in rapidly developing and commercializing our medicines may increase the resources that competitors allocate to similar treatments, which could affect our competitive advantage. We must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy, and tolerability to maintain market acceptance of our products. Our business also requires ensuring appropriate manufacturing and reimbursement of our products, which necessitates significant management and operational resources. We are subject to various and evolving laws and regulations that govern the privacy and security of personal data, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business. The discovery and development of new pharmaceutical products is a lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise. Our investments in product candidates are subject to considerable risks, and we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials, and nonclinical studies to balance potential risks and benefits. We have adopted business continuity plans to address crises, but if we are unable to implement these plans fully, we may experience significant disruptions in our operations. Our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel is critical, and failure to do so could materially harm our business. We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems, and any disruption or breach of these systems could adversely affect our operations. We are also subject to various legal proceedings, including product liability claims, which could divert significant resources and impact our financial condition. Our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and we expect our total cost of sales to increase due to anticipated growth in our product revenues. We have established a collaboration with third parties to advance our research and development efforts, and we expect to continue to evaluate collaboration and licensing opportunities. Our future capital requirements are significant, including operating expenses for research and development activities and obligations related to our manufacturing processes. We face risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including compliance with local laws and regulations, which could materially adversely affect our business.

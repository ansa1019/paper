The company faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products, which has resulted in reduced industry volume in many markets. These factors may continue to reduce consumption levels, increase down-trading, and heighten the risk of counterfeiting and contraband. The competitive environment can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, and regulatory initiatives that diminish the ability to differentiate tobacco products. The company’s operations may be influenced by economic, regulatory, and political developments, natural disasters, or conflicts, which could disrupt supply chains, manufacturing capabilities, or distribution capabilities. Such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment critical to business operations and difficulty in staffing and managing operations, potentially reducing volumes, revenues, and net earnings. The company may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns, which could impair profitability. The failure of information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties could result in business disruption, litigation, regulatory action, and loss of revenue or sensitive data. The company has backup systems and business continuity plans in place to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access, highlighting its commitment to operational continuity. The company’s ability to grow profitability may be limited by its inability to introduce new products, enter new markets, or improve margins through higher pricing and improvements in brand and geographic mix. The company’s growth strategy includes strengthening its brand portfolio through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships, although such opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve strategic objectives. The company is also subject to governmental investigations on various matters, which could materially affect its business. The ability to implement strategic initiatives is challenged by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking and the need to attract and retain talent. The company’s reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair competitiveness. The company’s operational flexibility is essential for adapting to external pressures and maintaining performance under challenging conditions. The organization’s resilience is reflected in its capacity to confront and benefit from sudden disruptive changes, which is critical for survival and growth in a turbulent business environment. The company recognizes the importance of crisis management and preparedness in maintaining organizational strength and effectiveness.

The company is dependent on the communications industry, including information technology and data communications, wireless communications, and broadband communications. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change, and the company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service, and delivery time. The company has focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this environment, believing that its global presence is an important competitive advantage. The company's strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products, and a high level of service while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. The company continually develops or creates new product line concepts, and its long-term results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source, and market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and future product lines. The company has encountered competition in substantially all areas of its business, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition. The company monitors the mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and is subject to interest rate volatility regarding existing and future issuances of debt. The company is also subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of various currencies, and it attempts to minimize currency exposure risk through various strategies. The company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The company's continued success depends upon its ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world, as any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource competencies needed to achieve its business objectives may adversely affect performance. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, resulting in adverse impacts to reputation and operating results. The company has implemented preventative security measures to address and mitigate these threats, including continuous monitoring of its information technology systems and networks. Changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond the company's control may adversely impact its business and operating results. The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, which could be affected by a global economic slowdown, uncertainty about economic conditions, significant changes in monetary and fiscal policies, and unforeseen interruptions to the company's business. The company has a history of borrowing funds domestically and has had the ability to borrow at reasonable interest rates. The company's primary sources of liquidity include internally generated cash flow, the commercial paper program, credit facilities, and cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the company's fundamental financial strengths, providing significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The company expects that ongoing cash requirements will be funded from these sources, although liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for products or a deterioration in certain financial ratios. The company anticipates making cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans, and the timing and amount of contributions will depend on various factors, including investment performance. The company has not recognized any goodwill impairment in recent years, and it regularly reviews the actual asset allocation of its pension plans.

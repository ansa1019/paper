In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-K, we face significant risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition, particularly in the semiconductor memory market where we experience intense competition. Our ability to maintain operational flexibility and adapt to external pressures is critical, especially given the dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products. We must continuously innovate and improve our manufacturing processes to mitigate risks associated with cost reductions and maintain gross margins. The semiconductor memory industry is characterized by rapid technological advancements and increasing complexity, which necessitate strategic product diversification and effective resource allocation. Our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies while managing the risks associated with joint ventures and strategic relationships, which may involve difficulties in technology transfer and production ramp-up. We have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing processes due to various factors, including power outages and equipment failures, which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer requirements. Our operations are also subject to oversight by the Japan court during the corporate reorganization proceedings of the MMJ companies, which may limit our ability to integrate these operations effectively. Additionally, we must navigate risks associated with international operations, including compliance with varying regulations and potential political instability, which could impact our operational continuity. The need for effective crisis management and preparedness is underscored by the potential for natural disasters and other disruptive events that could materially affect our business. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows is essential for servicing our debt obligations and funding ongoing operations, and any inability to do so could necessitate refinancing or restructuring efforts. We are also subject to counterparty default risks, which could limit our capacity to mitigate exposures effectively. The successful execution of our strategic initiatives, including capital investments and product development, is crucial for maintaining organizational resilience in a highly volatile market environment. Our focus on enhancing organizational capabilities and fostering inter-organizational collaboration will be vital in addressing the challenges posed by market fluctuations and ensuring long-term sustainability. The management of our supply chain and procurement processes is critical to avoid disruptions that could impact our operational effectiveness. Overall, our strategic response to these multifaceted challenges will determine our ability to adapt and thrive in a competitive landscape characterized by uncertainty and rapid change.

The company is pursuing a plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies, which may not achieve the intended benefits and could distract management from other tasks in operating the business. The business is sensitive to general economic conditions, and slower global economic growth, volatility in the currency and credit markets, and changes in government fiscal and monetary policies may adversely affect the company and its distributors, customers, and suppliers. The company has implemented multiple significant restructuring activities across its businesses to adjust its cost structure, which could slow improvements in products and services and limit the ability to respond to customers. The growth of the company depends on the growth of the markets it serves, and visibility into these markets is limited, particularly for those sold through distribution. The company faces intense competition and must retain longstanding relationships with major customers while continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand its brand recognition. The company’s success will depend on its ability to correctly identify customer needs, allocate research and development funding effectively, and anticipate competitors' innovations. The company has also engaged in acquisitions to expand its business, which involve risks such as the potential underperformance of acquired businesses and the challenge of integrating operations and retaining key employees. The company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect its reputation and financial statements. The company’s operations, products, and services expose it to environmental, health, and safety liabilities that could impact its reputation and financial statements. The company is also subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings that could adversely affect its financial statements. The company’s ability to grow revenues depends on its ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices. The company’s growth strategy includes significant investments to address rapid technological changes and to globalize its manufacturing and customer-facing resources. The company’s financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities, and reliance on sole or limited sources of supply could cause production interruptions. The company’s operations could be disrupted by catastrophic loss due to natural or man-made disasters, and significant disruptions in its information technology systems could adversely affect its business. The company has made substantial investments in its operations and anticipates that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to support its cash needs, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. The company’s defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its financial statements, and changes in market interest rates and investment losses may increase its funding obligations. The company’s ability to manage its debt levels and comply with covenants is critical to maintaining liquidity and financial stability. The company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices, which could impact its financial statements.

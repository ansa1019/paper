The strength of the alignment among the company, its franchisees, and suppliers has been key to McDonald's long-term success, enabling the identification, implementation, and scaling of ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. The company's business model allows for the consistent delivery of locally relevant restaurant experiences and integration into the communities it serves. In 2015, McDonald's initiated a turnaround plan, which included a worldwide restructuring aimed at enhancing operational growth, creating brand excitement, and increasing financial value. This restructuring is designed to sharpen the company's focus on the customer, drive greater accountability, and facilitate faster decision-making. The company is working to enhance the quality, choice, and variety of its menu while investing in technology to innovate customer ordering and service experiences. The turnaround plan emphasizes the importance of operational flexibility and the ability to adapt to evolving consumer preferences, which are critical for maintaining performance under pressure in a highly competitive environment. The company recognizes that its ability to compete successfully depends on improving existing products, developing new offerings, and managing the complexity of restaurant operations. Additionally, the company is focused on sustainability and social responsibility, which are essential for maintaining consumer trust and brand relevance. McDonald's is also committed to optimizing its restaurant ownership mix through refranchising, which aims to generate more stable and predictable revenue streams while operating with a less resource-intensive structure. The company has set a goal to become 95% franchised over the long term, which will enhance operational resilience and financial performance. The implementation of strategic initiatives, including refranchising and cost-saving measures, is expected to enhance financial value and operational continuity. The company is aware of the risks associated with its franchise business model, including the reliance on franchisees for operational success and the potential impact of external pressures on their performance. Furthermore, McDonald's is focused on managing its supply chain effectively to ensure reliable product availability, which is critical for maintaining operational integrity. The company continues to assess and respond to various risks, including economic conditions, competitive actions, and regulatory complexities, which can affect its operational effectiveness and financial results. By leveraging its system of franchisees and suppliers, McDonald's aims to enhance its resilience against market volatility and external disturbances, ensuring its ability to adapt and thrive in a challenging business environment. The company's commitment to innovation, operational management, and strategic foresight is fundamental to achieving its major objectives and sustaining long-term growth amidst adversity.

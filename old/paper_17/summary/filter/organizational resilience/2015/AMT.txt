A significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications sites could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Factors that may affect such demand include increased use of network sharing or mergers among wireless service providers, zoning, environmental, health, tax, or other government regulations, and the financial condition of wireless service providers. Our ongoing contractual revenues and future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed. Our business is subject to government and tax regulations, and changes in laws could restrict our ability to operate as we currently do. Our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us, including our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures, future growth, and to satisfy our distribution requirements. Our expansion initiatives involve risks and uncertainties, including those related to the integration of acquired assets, which could disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations and personnel, and significant acquisition-related integration costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks, including changes to existing or new tax laws impacting our operations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which can affect our ability to plan and budget for our international operations. Our revenues earned from international operations are primarily denominated in local currencies, and a weakening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues and operating profits. We depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants, and if any significant tenant is unable to perform its obligations, our revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may experience disputes with our tenants regarding lease terms, which could lead to lease terminations or modifications that adversely affect our business. Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is dependent on maintaining recurring revenue from multi-year contracts with tenants. The majority of our revenues are derived from a small number of tenants, and a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Our liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities and borrow funds under our credit facilities. We believe that our operating results will be sufficient to comply with the covenants of our debt agreements. The loan agreements contain financial and operating covenants that could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt or making distributions to stockholders. Our business is subject to risks associated with natural disasters and unforeseen events, which could impact our ability to provide services and lead to tenant loss. We rely on information technology and other resources to maintain our operations, and any failure or interruption could result in operational disruptions. We maintain disaster recovery programs, but if our systems are compromised, it could damage our reputation and require significant remediation costs. Our towers, data centers, and computer systems may be affected by natural disasters, and while we carry business interruption insurance, it may not cover all lost revenue.

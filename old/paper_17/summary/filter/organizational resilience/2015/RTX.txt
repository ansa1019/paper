Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be impacted by a variety of factors, including global economic, capital market, and political conditions, which may affect our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to changing environments. The tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing, potentially leading to decreased orders and impacting our operational flexibility. Our financial performance is dependent on the conditions of the construction and aerospace industries, which are influenced by external factors such as economic activity, regulatory changes, and geopolitical risks. A slowdown in these industries can adversely affect our financial performance, demonstrating the need for resilience strategies to navigate such disruptions. Our international operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws and economic conditions, which can impact our competitive position and necessitate adaptive strategies in response to varying market demands. We rely on a variety of suppliers and face risks related to supplier capacity constraints and production disruptions, which could impede our ability to meet customer commitments and affect our operational effectiveness. Furthermore, we engage in acquisitions and divestitures that require effective integration and strategic management to realize anticipated benefits, highlighting the importance of organizational agility in navigating complex business environments. Our business may also be adversely affected by cyber-based risks and other disruptions, necessitating robust crisis management and preparedness measures to safeguard our operations. We invest in research and development to foster innovation and respond to evolving customer needs, yet the unpredictability of technological advancements and market acceptance poses challenges to our resilience. Additionally, we are subject to various legal and compliance risks that could disrupt our operations and require effective risk management to mitigate potential liabilities. Our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is further tested by fluctuations in financial markets and interest rates, which can impact our defined benefit pension plans and overall financial health. We recognize that effective stakeholder engagement and collaboration networks are essential for enhancing our resilience and ensuring long-term sustainability in a turbulent market landscape. Overall, our organizational practices must focus on adaptability, resource management, and strategic foresight to navigate uncertainties and maintain competitive advantage in the face of adversity.

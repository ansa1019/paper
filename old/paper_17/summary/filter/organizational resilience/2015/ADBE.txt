Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the complexity, cost, and uncertainty of developing new high technology products and services. If we fail to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand. Additionally, any delay in the development, production, marketing, or offering of a new product or service could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue and weakening our competitive position. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance existing products and services, introduce new offerings on a timely basis, and respond to emerging standards and technological developments. If we cannot continue to adapt our products to new platforms, our business could be harmed. The introduction of new products, services, and business models by competitors could harm our competitive position and results of operations. Our markets are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards, and disruptive technology developments. If we fail to manage transitions to new business models and markets, our results could suffer. We often release new offerings and employ new delivery methods, and it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful. Market acceptance of new offerings will depend on our ability to include functionality that addresses customer requirements and optimally price our products. We devote significant resources to the development of technologies in markets where our operating history is less extensive. Our ability to sell additional features and services to current customers depends on customer satisfaction with our products and services. Security vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenue or liability claims. Maintaining the security of our products is critical, and the costs to prevent or address security problems are significant. A disruption, infiltration, or failure of our systems or third-party services could cause interruptions, reputational harm, and loss of critical data. We rely on third-party service providers for customer service and technical support, which presents risks to our business. If we encounter problems with these providers, our reputation may be harmed, and we could lose customers. Our corporate headquarters and critical operations are located in areas vulnerable to catastrophic events, which could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations. Climate change may pose regulatory and environmental challenges affecting our operations. We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business. Our international operations are subject to various risks, including changes in government preferences for software procurement and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements. If we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. Effective succession planning is critical for our long-term success. We believe that our corporate culture, which fosters innovation and teamwork, is a critical contributor to our success.

In addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K, we face risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or the price of our common stock. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with health and wellness, convenience, and the source of ingredients. Our continued success is also dependent on our product and marketing innovation, including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products and improving the quality of existing products. We must sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers, and any significant changes in consumer preferences or our inability to react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products. Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by governmental agencies, and changes in these laws may alter the environment in which we do business, potentially increasing our costs or liabilities or reducing demand for our products. We are also exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. Our ability to manage these risks is critical to our operational flexibility and overall performance. We have implemented strategic plans to position our business for future success, including enhancing our manufacturing automation, optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, and re-engineering our go-to-market systems. These initiatives are designed to improve efficiency, decision-making, and brand management across the organization, enabling us to compete effectively. Our risk management framework involves identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and addressing our top strategic, financial, operating, and compliance risks, with oversight from our board of directors. We continuously monitor the economic, operating, and political environment in the markets where we operate to mitigate unfavorable impacts on our results. Our productivity initiatives support our growth by reducing costs and improving efficiencies, and we are focused on building new capabilities to meet evolving consumer demands. The changing global economic, social, and political landscape requires us to adapt and innovate continuously. We are also committed to fostering a culture of collaboration and developing the next generation of talent to ensure long-term sustainable performance. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets or if we fail to manage risks associated with operating in these markets. Business disruptions, including adverse weather conditions, government actions, and health epidemics, could impair our ability to manufacture, transport, and sell our products, necessitating effective crisis management and recovery strategies. We must maintain strong relationships with our key customers and adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape to secure adequate shelf space and product availability. Our ability to protect our information systems against cyberattacks is also critical to maintaining operational continuity and organizational resilience.

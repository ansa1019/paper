The statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully, as they involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could affect our organizational resilience. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management's plans and assumptions. Achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and inaccurate assumptions, which could materially affect our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Companies may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers, which could adversely affect our revenues and operational flexibility. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues, impacting our resilience in the face of competitive pressures. Our ability to launch new products and respond to environmental disruptions is critical for our survival and growth. The introduction of competitive products can result in erosion of sales and potential product obsolescence, which challenges our organizational health and requires effective risk management and strategic adaptation. Our growth potential depends on our ability to identify and develop new products that address unmet medical needs, necessitating a balance between current growth and future investments. The integration of emerging markets into our operations is part of our strategy to enhance resilience, although these markets may be vulnerable to financial or political instability. Difficulties in product manufacturing or marketing could affect future results through regulatory actions, supply disruptions, or reputational harm, which are critical to our operational continuity. Outsourcing certain services may expose us to sub-optimal quality of service delivery, impacting our ability to meet demand and maintain organizational effectiveness. We expect to continue enhancing our product pipeline through collaborations and acquisitions, but these plans are subject to the availability and cost of opportunities, which may affect our strategic resilience. The evolving regulatory environment poses challenges that could impact our ability to adapt and respond effectively to market changes. The global economic environment exposes us to pricing pressures and access restrictions, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. We continue to monitor the credit and economic situations in various international markets, as changes in these conditions could impact our results of operations. Our internal control over financial reporting is essential for maintaining the accuracy of our disclosures, and lapses could undermine investor confidence. The complexities of integrating businesses through mergers and acquisitions, such as the pending combination with Allergan, present risks that could disrupt operations and affect our ability to realize anticipated benefits. The ongoing threats from counterfeit medicines and the need for robust supply chain management are critical for maintaining the integrity of our operations. We undertake significant efforts to counteract these threats, although there is no assurance that our efforts will be entirely successful. Overall, our ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes is integral to our organizational resilience and long-term success.

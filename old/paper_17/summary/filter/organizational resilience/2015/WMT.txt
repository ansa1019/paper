The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Strategic risks, including general or macro-economic factors, may materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. Higher levels of unemployment, inflation, and changes in consumer spending patterns may adversely affect consumer demand for our products and services. Our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geopolitical events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Such events could result in physical damage to our properties, the closure of stores, and disruption in the supply of products. Our reliance on information systems to process transactions and manage our business means that disruptions could harm our ability to conduct operations. We maintain independent, redundant systems, but any material interruption may have a material adverse effect on our business. The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand and the availability of merchandise. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes and preferences could negatively affect our relationship with customers and our market share. Our ability to attract and retain qualified associates is critical to our operations, and changes in labor costs or regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance. Our expansion strategy depends on our ability to execute retail concepts successfully in new markets and to locate, hire, and retain qualified personnel. Economic, business, and legal environments in foreign markets may impede our ability to expand operations and increase net sales. We face risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political, and economic conditions specific to the countries in which we operate. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and reported results. Our operations are subject to various legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are conducting an internal investigation into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which may expose us to negative consequences. Our ability to maintain security measures to protect information is critical, as any breach could materially adversely affect our operations and reputation. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for new developments and technology investments by competitors. The integration of physical retail and digital retail is essential for maintaining market position, and any failure to provide user-friendly e-commerce platforms could adversely impact our business. Our operational continuity is dependent on effective crisis management and the ability to adapt to unexpected situations. The multifaceted nature of resilience in our operations requires a focus on strategic initiatives, resource allocation, and inter-organizational collaboration to ensure organizational effectiveness and adaptability in the face of adversity.

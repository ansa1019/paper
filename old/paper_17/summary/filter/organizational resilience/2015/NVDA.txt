In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, we recognize that our success depends significantly on our ability to identify and develop new products, services, and technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility under competitive pressures. Our business strategy is focused on creating products and services that anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends, which is critical for adapting to unexpected situations and ensuring business continuity. We face risks related to our ability to successfully compete in our target markets, including the need to effectively execute transitions to new business models and markets, which could impact our operational management and overall performance. Business disruptions, including natural disasters and other significant events, could harm our operations and result in substantial recovery time and expenditures. Our corporate headquarters and critical business operations are located in areas vulnerable to environmental perturbations, which underscores the importance of our crisis management strategies. We also depend on third-party foundries and subcontractors for manufacturing, which reduces our control over product quality and delivery schedules, thereby affecting our ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational continuity. The concentration of our revenue from a limited number of customers presents additional risks, as any significant changes in their purchasing patterns could adversely affect our financial condition. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to address potential losses from customer defaults, which reflects our proactive measures in risk assessment and resource management. Our research and development expenses are aimed at fostering innovation and enhancing our organizational capabilities, which are vital for sustaining competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving market. The complexities of our supply chain and reliance on external partners necessitate robust strategic initiatives to mitigate risks associated with manufacturing yields and product defects. Furthermore, our ability to navigate the global business environment, including international economic and political conditions, is crucial for maintaining resilience against external disturbances. We continuously evaluate our operational practices and financial strategies to ensure that we can adapt to changing market conditions and technological advancements, which is essential for our long-term organizational health and survival. Our commitment to improving gross margins and managing operating expenses reflects our focus on maintaining performance under pressure while pursuing strategic growth opportunities. The ongoing transformation of our business, including the wind-down of certain operations, is designed to reallocate resources toward areas with higher growth potential, thereby enhancing our resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity.

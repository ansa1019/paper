The company's inability to successfully recover should it experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability. If a business continuity event occurs, the ability to operate will depend, in part, on the continued availability of personnel, office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer, telecommunication, and other related systems and operations. The risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas, particularly major metropolitan centers, where significant operations are located. The company regularly assesses and takes steps to improve its existing business continuity, disaster recovery, and data recovery plans. However, a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale could materially interrupt business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, and damaged client relationships. The company faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses, including from disintermediation, as the competitive landscape continues to evolve. The loss of members of the senior management team or other key colleagues, or failure to attract, retain, and develop talent, could have a material adverse effect on the business. Failure to maintain corporate culture, particularly in a hybrid work environment, could damage reputation. The company relies on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of business operations and to provide services to clients, which may act in ways that could harm the business. A failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements in a high-quality and timely manner could result in economic and reputational harm. The company’s business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if it is unable to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological changes. The evolving needs and financial circumstances of clients may reduce demand for consulting services and could adversely affect revenues and profitability. The company is subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty, and other claims, which could subject it to significant liability for monetary damages and reputational harm. The company’s operations depend on its ability to protect its technology infrastructure against damage, and if a business continuity event occurs, it could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to operations or delivery of services. The company continues to monitor the ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, including the impact of the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted businesses globally. The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 will depend on future developments that are unable to be predicted. The company’s investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, counterparty, foreign exchange, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by global macroeconomic conditions, market volatility, and regulatory difficulties. The company’s ability to anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological changes is critical for maintaining competitive advantage.

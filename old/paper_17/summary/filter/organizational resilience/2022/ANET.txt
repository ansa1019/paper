Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including supply chain constraints, inflation, and geopolitical conditions, which may adversely affect our ability to forecast component supply, manufacturing capacity, and timing of inventory receipts. We have been and could continue to be subject to manufacturing disruptions and supply chain delays, placing significant pressure on supply chain management, manufacturing, inventory, and quality control management. Consequently, this has hindered and may continue to hinder our ability to fulfill customer demand, which could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, reduce future sales, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns, the time it takes these customers to evaluate and accept our products, and the overall complexity of these large orders. Our reliance on component suppliers yields the potential for the infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights due to the incorporation of such components into our products. We are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping end-customer orders on time, which may result in the loss of sales and end customers. Our ability to manage our supply chain may also be adversely affected by factors including geopolitical conditions and global economic uncertainties, which have resulted in prolonged manufacturing and supply chain disruptions. We have extended our demand planning horizon and increased our purchase commitments for components to support long-term customer demand, but we cannot be certain that suppliers will meet their commitments or that actual customer demand will match our forecasts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, shipments of our products could be delayed or halted entirely, which could result in lost sales and damage to our end customer relationships. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology and network connectivity, and weak economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on the timing, size, and complexity of orders, especially with respect to our large end customers. Our operating cash flows have also been negatively impacted by increased component inventories awaiting supply of a limited number of scarce components necessary to build and ship completed products. We continue to face risks associated with the acquisition and integration of complementary companies, products, or technologies, which may disrupt our business and require significant management attention. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment, including developing market-leading products and features that address the needs of our existing and new customers. We must also continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. The extent of the impact of macroeconomic factors on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, which continue to evolve and are unpredictable.

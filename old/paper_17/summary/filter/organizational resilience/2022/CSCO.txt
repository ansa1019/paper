The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally, impacting our supply chain and customer demand. We continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages, which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply chain costs. The magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain. Our customers have experienced disruptions in their operations, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, adversely affecting our results of operations. We have taken multiple steps to mitigate the component shortages and deliver products to our customers, including partnering with key suppliers and modifying our product designs to leverage alternate suppliers. We have increased our inventory balances and purchase commitments to secure supply, which has increased our supply chain exposure and the risk of future material excess and obsolete inventory. Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price. We are focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing their digital transformations, and we remain committed to driving a trusted customer experience through our innovation, choice, and people. The ongoing effect of the Russia and Ukraine war is difficult to predict due to uncertainties, and we have recognized certain non-recurring charges related to non-recoverability of assets in these regions. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment, and while the overall environment remains uncertain, we are investing in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term. Our business model transformation includes delivering increased software and subscription offerings, and we are focused on maintaining operational continuity and flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions. We are committed to ensuring our organizational resilience through strategic initiatives and resource management, as we navigate the complexities of the current business environment. The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging, significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions, which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. We believe our strong cash and cash equivalents position allows us to use our resources for strategic investments, acquisitions, and to meet customer demands. Our growth depends upon our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis, and we are committed to developing new products and services to address emerging technological trends and customer needs. We continue to assess the sustainability of improvements in our business in emerging markets and are exposed to various risks, including fluctuations in demand, supply chain disruptions, and the need to adapt to changing customer requirements. Our operational management strategies focus on maintaining flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures and uncertainties, ensuring we can respond effectively to the challenges presented by the current business landscape.

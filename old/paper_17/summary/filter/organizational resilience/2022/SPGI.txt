The risks and uncertainties described could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential data, and breaches may cause material interruptions or malfunctions, compromising the confidentiality and integrity of information. We are exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software, which may require us to devote time and resources to remediation. The unauthorized disclosure of material non-public information could damage our brand and reputation, leading to loss of customer confidence and financial losses. Our integration with IHS Markit involves significant costs and challenges that may materially adversely impact anticipated synergies. We face increased cybersecurity risks as we continue this integration, and our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions may not be successful. Our ability to conduct business may be materially impacted by disruptions in the infrastructure that supports our operations, including natural disasters and geopolitical events. We believe we have appropriate policies and internal controls to ensure stability and security, but unanticipated system failures or unauthorized access could disrupt our operations. The markets in which we operate continuously change to adapt to customer needs, and our inability to innovate and compete could impact profitability. The rapid change of technology requires us to deploy improved processes and technology to innovate and support new products. Our ability to attract and retain key qualified personnel is critical, and challenges in this area could adversely affect our strategic goals. Our business continuity plans are regularly assessed and improved, but significant disasters could materially interrupt operations and result in financial loss and reputational harm. Outsourcing certain functions to third-party service providers may also expose us to risks, including unauthorized access to systems and regulatory penalties. Our reputation, credibility, and brand are key competitive strengths, and negative perceptions could harm our ability to attract and retain customers. We are actively engaged in analyzing and providing views on economic conditions, including assessing the impact of events that create volatility and uncertainty. Our divisions focus on developing key product offerings and adapting to changing market conditions, including the transition to renewable energy and sustainability. The evolving regulatory landscape may increase compliance risks and costs, impacting our ability to provide products and services. Our strategic initiatives include enhancing customer support, investing in technology, and ensuring our people are engaged and aligned with our purpose and values. We continuously commit to risk management and compliance across S&P Global, recognizing that failure to adapt to changes in our compliance obligations could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.

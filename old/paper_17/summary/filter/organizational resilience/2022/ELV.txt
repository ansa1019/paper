In evaluating our business, we recognize that numerous factors affecting healthcare costs may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage healthcare costs, impacting our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. These factors include changes in healthcare practices, demographic characteristics, medical cost inflation, increased labor costs, and the evolution of new technologies, drugs, and treatments, which all contribute to increased complexity and operational pressures. The covid-19 pandemic has introduced significant uncertainty, leading to increased healthcare costs due to higher utilization rates and labor shortages, which may further complicate our operational management and resource allocation strategies. We continue to evaluate our experience in the public exchange markets, making adjustments to our premium rates and geographic participation based on expected financial performance and regulatory environments. Our profitability depends on accurately predicting and pricing healthcare costs and managing future healthcare costs through medical management and product design. The reserves we establish for health insurance policy benefits are based on assumptions concerning trends in healthcare costs and general economic conditions, which require ongoing risk assessment and adaptation to ensure organizational resilience. 

We face pressure to contain premium rates, and our customers may renegotiate contracts or move to competitors, which could adversely affect our business and operational continuity. Additionally, we are subject to risks associated with pandemics and other extreme events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Our programs to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents, as well as contingency plans for potential liabilities, are crucial for maintaining operational integrity and resilience. The integration of entities we acquire and the expansion of our business into new jurisdictions may affect how existing laws apply to us, requiring strategic adaptation to ensure compliance and operational effectiveness. 

We have implemented business continuity and disaster recovery strategies to mitigate risks associated with operational disruptions, including those stemming from cyber-attacks and data security incidents. However, there is no guarantee that these efforts will be fully effective, and failure to implement adequate strategies could significantly reduce our ability to provide products and services to our customers. Our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with healthcare providers is essential for our operational success, and we must navigate the competitive landscape to secure favorable contracts. 

As we evolve our business to offer products beyond traditional health insurance, we are exposed to new risks and regulatory challenges that may impact our organizational resilience. Our strategic initiatives focus on maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changes in the healthcare environment, ensuring we can effectively respond to external pressures and maintain our competitive advantage. The ongoing assessment of our operational resources and capabilities is critical for sustaining performance under pressure and achieving our major objectives in a turbulent market.

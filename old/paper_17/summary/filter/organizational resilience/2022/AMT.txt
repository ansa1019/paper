A significant decrease in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and we cannot control that demand. Factors that may affect such demand include increased mergers, consolidations or exits that reduce the number of communications service providers or increased use of network sharing among governments or communications service providers. The financial condition of communications service providers, zoning, environmental, health, tax or other government regulations, and disruptions in the financial and credit markets, such as the material adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and markets, may also impact demand. The ability and willingness of wireless and cloud service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure is critical, as is the deployment of next-generation wireless technologies. Our growth projections are based on future revenue from a small number of customers, and such projections could be adversely impacted by changes in their creditworthiness and financial strength. The current inflationary and high-interest rate environment could materially and adversely affect our customers, leading to liquidity risks and potential uncollectible accounts receivable. We are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our largest customer in India, which represented a significant portion of our revenue, communicated its inability to resume full payments, leading to impairments in our long-lived assets. The ongoing economic difficulties and potential bankruptcy of customers could further impact our revenue and operational continuity. We depend on the continued financial strength of our customers, many of whom operate with substantial levels of debt and may face capital constraints that could reduce their spending. Our international operations expose us to risks associated with compliance with various laws and regulations, which could limit our operational flexibility and ability to adapt to changes in the business environment. We must safeguard our customers' infrastructure and equipment located in our data centers to ensure operational continuity. Problems at our data centers could result in service interruptions, impacting our ability to meet service level commitments and potentially leading to claims related to such failures. Our business is also subject to risks associated with natural disasters and unforeseen events, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial performance. Cybersecurity incidents pose additional risks, as unauthorized access to our systems could result in significant costs and reputational damage. We continuously evaluate and enhance our cybersecurity measures, but the increasing sophistication of threats may challenge our ability to protect our operations. Our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is influenced by maintaining recurring revenue and minimizing operating costs, which is essential for our organizational resilience. The variability in our revenues, particularly from a small number of tenants, underscores the importance of effective risk management and strategic response mechanisms to ensure organizational health and adaptability in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

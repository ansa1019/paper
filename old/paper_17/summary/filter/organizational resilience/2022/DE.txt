The following risks are considered material to John Deere's business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions. Strategic risks include international, national, and regional trade laws, regulations, and policies that could significantly impair John Deere's profitability and growth prospects. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deere's ability to export goods and services and limits access to raw materials and high-quality parts at competitive prices. Trade restrictions and changes in global trade policies may affect John Deere's competitive position and growth opportunities. John Deere's efforts to grow depend in part upon access to additional geographic markets, which may have greater political and economic volatility. The company's operations expose it to multiple and potentially conflicting business practices and legal requirements that are complex and difficult to navigate. Expanding operations globally increases exposure to currency fluctuations, which can materially affect financial results. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine could adversely impact business and financial results, leading to potential operational reductions depending on the conflict's evolution. Negative economic conditions can materially weaken demand for John Deere's equipment and services, limiting access to funding and resulting in higher costs. Economic uncertainty due to the COVID pandemic and geopolitical instability has significantly increased demand uncertainty, leading to supply chain challenges and increased production costs. John Deere's ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business and financial condition. The company competes on the basis of product performance, innovation, and quality, and relies on a network of independent dealers to manage product distribution. Disruptions to manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities through labor disputes adversely affect the company. John Deere's ability to attract, develop, and retain qualified employees is critical to executing its strategy, and higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect operations. Security breaches and disruptions to information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations and compromise sensitive information. The occurrence of unexpected events, including natural disasters and pandemics, has and could adversely affect operations and financial performance. The potential physical impacts of climate change on facilities, suppliers, and customers may adversely affect demand for products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of operations. John Deere's global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations, which could expose the company to potential liabilities and increased costs. The company faces risks of exposure to various claims and lawsuits, which may harm its business, financial condition, and reputation. The defense of legal proceedings may result in significant expenditures and divert management's attention from business operations. Overall, John Deere's ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to changing conditions is critical for sustaining performance and achieving strategic objectives.

The corporation's risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a strong and flexible financial position to withstand challenging economic conditions. Effective management of business continuity increasingly depends on the security, reliability, and adequacy of operational systems. The corporation has developed and maintains contingency plans to prepare for potential adverse economic, financial, or market stress, which include monitoring, escalation, and actions to increase capital and access funding sources. The risk framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for managing risks, ensuring that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated, and responded to in a timely manner. The corporation's strategic plan aligns with its risk appetite and capital plan, addressing strategic risks impacting each business. The executive management team monitors performance against strategic objectives and provides regular progress reports to the board, including assessments of strategic risks and necessary actions. 

Operational risk exposure exists throughout the organization and is influenced by interactions with third parties and the financial services industry infrastructure. The corporation's operational and security systems are integral to performance, and disruptions to critical business operations may arise from various factors, including natural disasters and cyber threats. The corporation employs a multi-layered global information security program to prepare for, prevent, detect, mitigate, respond to, and recover from cyber threats.

These risks may impact credit quality and operational capabilities. The corporation has committed to achieving net-zero emissions in its financing activities and operations by 2050, with interim targets set for 2030. 

The provision for credit losses has increased due to loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, reflecting the need to manage credit risk effectively.

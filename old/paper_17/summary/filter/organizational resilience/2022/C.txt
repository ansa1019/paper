Citi has embarked on a multiyear transformation, with the target outcome to change its business and operating models such that they simultaneously strengthen risk and controls and improve its value to customers, clients, and shareholders. This includes continued investments in its transformation, including the remediation of its consent orders. The CEO has made the strengthening of Citi's risk and control environment a strategic priority and has established a chief administrative officer organization to centralize program management. Citi's efforts include significant investments in transformation, business-led investments, and volume-related expenses, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to external pressures. The company has made substantial progress on its consumer banking business divestitures, closing sales in five exit markets and working toward closing four additional sale transactions, as well as progressing with the ongoing wind-downs of the Korea consumer banking business and Russia consumer, local commercial, and institutional businesses. These actions reflect a proactive approach to resource allocation and strategic response to environmental disruptions. The increase in operating expenses was driven by continued investments in transformation and risk and control initiatives, which are critical for maintaining organizational health and resilience under challenging conditions. The net credit losses decreased significantly, reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality, which is indicative of effective risk management and organizational adaptability. The company anticipates incurring higher expenses in 2023, primarily driven by transformation-related investments, which are essential for enhancing operational continuity and resilience. Citi's CET1 capital ratio increased, driven by net income and business actions to reduce risk-weighted assets, demonstrating a commitment to maintaining financial strength amidst external disturbances. The companyâ€™s diversified revenue streams and strategic initiatives in institutional clients group and personal banking and wealth management reflect its multifaceted approach to achieving competitive advantage and sustaining performance under pressure. The ongoing focus on enhancing client relationships and deepening existing client engagements is crucial for fostering organizational resilience and ensuring long-term success. The organizational transformation efforts are designed to improve Citi's capabilities to confront and recover from adverse conditions, thereby reinforcing its operational integrity and performance. The management's emphasis on risk assessment and strategic foresight is vital for navigating complex situations and maintaining a trajectory of positive adjustment in the face of adversity. The company's commitment to learning and adaptation through its transformation initiatives positions it to effectively manage future uncertainties and enhance its overall resilience in a turbulent market environment.

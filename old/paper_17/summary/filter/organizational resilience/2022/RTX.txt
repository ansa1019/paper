Our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity can be impacted by changes in global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and disruptions in supply chains, which may adversely affect our performance. The ongoing global supply chain and labor market challenges have negatively affected our business, and we expect these issues to continue, impacting our ability to meet commitments to customers. We continuously monitor labor market conditions and trends and work to mitigate constraints through talent acquisition, workforce succession planning, and initiatives to attract, retain, and rehire former employees. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, and the industries in which we operate, although we have seen signs of ongoing recovery in commercial air travel. The pace of recovery may be impacted by inflation, an economic downturn, or government budget deficits, among other factors. We depend on the availability of materials and performance of our suppliers, and disruptions in the supply chain have negatively affected our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We work continuously to mitigate the effects of these supply chain issues and risks, including seeking alternate supply sources and increasing our inventory of available materials and parts. Our performance requires a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, and services, and we rely on U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers. We face risks relating to our U.S. government contracts, including the potential termination of contracts, performance delays, and cost overruns, which could negatively impact our competitive position and liquidity. Changes in U.S. government defense spending could also negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, and overall business. Our business is sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, government budgets, and geopolitical factors, which could adversely affect our operations. We are subject to risks associated with political and economic factors, regulatory requirements, competition, and other risks in our international sales and operations. The evolving nature of safety and performance standards creates uncertainty regarding program profitability, particularly with our aircraft engine products. We invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in technologies aimed at meeting the evolving needs of our customers. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these investments depends on various factors, including execution of internal and external performance plans, achieving cost efficiencies, and the availability of qualified personnel. We face significant competition domestically and internationally, and our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to manage costs, innovate, and respond to customer needs effectively. We have implemented strategic initiatives to improve our business and reduce costs, including a significant digital transformation initiative. If we do not successfully manage our strategic initiatives, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, potentially disrupting our operations. The complexity of our operations and the need for effective collaboration across departments are critical for maintaining organizational resilience. We continuously assess our organizational practices and capabilities to adapt to changing market conditions and external pressures, ensuring we can maintain operational continuity and performance under pressure.

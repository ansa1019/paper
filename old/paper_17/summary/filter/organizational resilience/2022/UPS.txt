Our business, financial condition, and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have significantly impacted our operations and those of our customers. The pandemic has contributed to disruptions in supply chains, economic uncertainty, and volatility in global financial markets, leading to a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance. We face risks associated with changes in general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, which may affect our ability to adjust our business model and mitigate impacts. Our industry is rapidly evolving, with demands for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments, requiring us to maintain operational flexibility and adapt to competitive pressures. We depend on the skills and continued service of our employees and must attract, engage, and retain a diverse workforce to support our core values. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to various factors, including turnover and market pressures. The negotiation of collective bargaining agreements may also impact our competitive position and results of operations. Increased security requirements and potential cyber threats pose additional challenges to our operational integrity. We rely on information technology networks and systems to operate our business, and disruptions in these systems could materially affect us. We have invested in IT security initiatives and disaster recovery plans to enhance our resilience against such threats. Our strategic initiatives, including transformation efforts, aim to create a more agile and effective organization capable of responding to market demands and external pressures. We are committed to sustainability and have set goals to reduce carbon emissions, although achieving these goals depends on technological advancements and regulatory developments beyond our control. Weather conditions and natural disasters may disrupt our business, necessitating effective emergency management and crisis response strategies. Our operations are also influenced by geopolitical uncertainties, which could materially affect our business performance. We continuously assess our operational capabilities and resource allocation to ensure we can respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure. The evolving regulatory landscape and compliance requirements may increase our operating costs, impacting our ability to adapt strategically. We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement in enhancing our resilience and ensuring long-term success. Our focus on innovation and service quality is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and addressing customer needs in a turbulent market environment. The ability to foresee and confront challenges, along with effective resource management, will be critical for our organizational health and sustainability.

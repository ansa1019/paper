Our business environment has been characterized by globalization of marketplaces, customers, and competitors; growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation; commodity, interest rate, inflation rate, and financial markets volatility and uncertainty; and increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies. We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of recurring revenues from 34% in 2014 to 51% in 2022. These recurring revenues include data services, listings, and various mortgage technology solutions. Our operational flexibility is supported by our strategic initiatives to enhance technology and service innovation, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage amid external pressures and environmental perturbations. We continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates and inflation rates, as well as the uncertainty surrounding geopolitical events, which may impact our business and require adaptive strategies. 

We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor, and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Our risk management program includes initial and ongoing membership standards to reduce exposure, and we utilize proprietary risk models to determine the amounts required for original margin and guaranty fund deposits. The cash and invested margin deposits are maintained in accounts with national banks and highly-rated financial institutions or secured through direct investments, ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. Our commitment to preserving capital while maximizing yields is paramount in mitigating credit, market, and liquidity risks.

We have established a global code of business conduct that applies to all employees, officers, and directors, reinforcing our organizational health and resilience. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements. The effectiveness of our internal control system is assessed regularly, and we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.

In 2022, we incurred acquisition-related transaction costs primarily due to legal and consulting expenses related to our pending acquisition of Black Knight and our integration of Ellie Mae. We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. Our operational continuity is supported by our comprehensive u.s. residential mortgage platform, which aims to address inefficiencies in the mortgage market and enhance customer experience.

The impact of inflation has not materially affected our operations, as technological advances and competition have generally kept prices for hardware and software constant. We believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices we charge are not governed by long-term contracts. Our organizational resilience is further supported by our commitment to learning and adaptation, ensuring we can confront challenges and maintain performance under pressure. 

We continuously evaluate our strategic response to changing market conditions and operational demands, ensuring our organizational practices remain robust and effective in the face of adversity.

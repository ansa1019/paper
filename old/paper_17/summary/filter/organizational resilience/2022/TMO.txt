Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. We are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including strengthening our presence in selected geographic markets, allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects, expanding our service offerings, and continuing key customer initiatives. Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health epidemics and pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has had an adverse impact on certain of our operations, supply chains, and distribution systems. The ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on maintaining the safety and health of our factory employees. Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us. We are subject to risks associated with public health epidemics and pandemics, and our ability to adapt to these challenges is critical for maintaining operational continuity. Our strategy to grow in emerging markets may not be successful, and growth rates in these markets may not be sustainable due to various external pressures. We face increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to our environmental, social, and governance practices, which requires continuous monitoring of evolving laws, regulations, and standards. A failure to adequately meet evolving stakeholder expectations may result in noncompliance, reputational impacts, and an inability to attract customers. Our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials or components could cause production interruptions, delays, and inefficiencies, impacting our operational flexibility. Significant disruptions in our information technology systems or breaches of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business, highlighting the need for robust risk management strategies. We must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers' products to maintain our competitive advantage. Our ability to realize the value of goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses, which are influenced by how well we integrate these businesses. Natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events may disrupt our facilities or the facilities of third parties on which we depend, impacting customer spending and operational performance. Our ability to attract and retain key talent is crucial for our organizational effectiveness, and macroeconomic conditions could materially impact our workforce. We must continuously evaluate our operational management strategies to ensure resilience against market volatility and environmental disruptions. The companyâ€™s proven growth strategy has enabled it to generate free cash flow and access capital markets, which is essential for supporting strategic initiatives and maintaining organizational health. The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents, along with future cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future.

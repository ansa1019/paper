The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, and the rapid development of new technologies, services, and products has eliminated many traditional distinctions among service providers, bringing new competitors into the market. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on various factors, including our network quality, capacity, coverage, pricing of products and services, and the quality of customer service. We must adapt to future changes in technology and enhance our offerings to address changing customer demands. The deployment of our 5G network is subject to risks, including equipment availability and regulatory matters, which could hinder our ability to implement our business strategy and impact our financial performance. Adverse economic conditions, such as inflation and recession, could negatively affect the affordability and demand for our products and services, leading to increased competition for customers and potential declines in revenues and earnings. We have experienced increases in direct costs due to inflation, which have altered consumer preferences and made them more price-conscious. These factors, along with intense competition, resulted in increased costs and lower earnings per share, prompting us to lower growth expectations and financial guidance. Cyber attacks pose significant operational risks, potentially causing equipment failures, loss of information, and disruptions to operations. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks are costly and require ongoing monitoring. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions could damage our infrastructure, resulting in significant disruptions to operations and recovery time. We are implementing measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from these events, but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have materially affected our business, financial condition, and results of operations, impacting customer usage and payment capabilities. We depend on key suppliers and vendors for equipment and services, and disruptions in the supply chain due to geopolitical factors or public health crises could hinder our ability to provide products and services. We maintain a significant amount of debt, which could limit our flexibility in responding to changes in market conditions and increase vulnerability during downturns. Our capital investments are focused on expanding our networks and enhancing operational efficiency, which are critical for maintaining competitive advantage. We are creating business value by earning the trust of our stakeholders and limiting our environmental impact while supporting customer growth. Our strategy requires significant capital investments to acquire wireless spectrum and develop advanced information technology systems. We expect that our next-generation multi-use platform will simplify operations and speed the deployment of 5G technology, creating new opportunities in the business market. The anticipated deployment of c-band spectrum is expected to drive innovative products and services, fueling growth. We believe that our investments aimed at expanding our portfolio will provide an efficient and reliable infrastructure for competing in the information economy. We are focused on executing the fundamentals of the business, maintaining a high-quality customer base, and strengthening our balance sheet to navigate the challenges posed by the competitive landscape and economic pressures.

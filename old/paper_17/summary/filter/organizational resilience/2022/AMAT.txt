The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes. To meet rapidly changing demand, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses. During periods of increasing demand, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and effectively manage its supply chain. Similarly, during periods of decreasing demand, it must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions, which requires operational flexibility and effective resource management. Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy, including economic and business conditions that could materially adversely impact its operating results. Uncertain or adverse economic conditions could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand, which may lead to customers pushing out or canceling orders, negatively impacting demand for Applied's products and services. The company must also navigate supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions, and the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, which could affect its ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs or excess inventory. Applied's business depends on timely supply of equipment, services, and related products to meet changing technical and volume requirements, which in turn depends on the timely delivery of parts and materials from suppliers. Significant and sudden increases in demand have resulted in shortages of parts and materials needed to manufacture products, adversely impacting suppliers' ability to meet demand requirements. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have also adversely impacted Applied's operations and financial results, leading to supply chain and transportation disruptions, production delays, and capacity limitations. Applied's strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections and expanding its served market opportunities. The company must maintain a competitive advantage in its equipment and service products by investing in research, development, and engineering to deliver innovative technology that meets customer requirements. Applied's ability to successfully expand into new and related markets may be adversely affected by various factors, including the complexity of managing multiple businesses and the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies. The ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is vital to Applied's success, as fluctuations in global economic conditions and competition for talent may impact its ability to capitalize on market opportunities. The company must also effectively manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions to mitigate risks and ensure operational continuity. Applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, along with existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity requirements for the next 12 months, emphasizing the importance of strategic resource allocation and operational resilience in navigating uncertainties.

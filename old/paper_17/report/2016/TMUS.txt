item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating t-mobile. our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results, as well as the price of our common stock and other securities, could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
risks related to our business and the wireless industry the scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum, and regulations relating to spectrum use, may adversely affect our business strategy and financial performance.
we will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth, expand and deepen our coverage, maintain our quality of service, meet increasing customer demands and deploy new technologies. we will be at a competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain markets if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum before reaching capacity. as a result, we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum, which could be significant.
9
the continued interest in, and acquisition of, spectrum by existing carriers and others may reduce our ability to acquire and/or raise the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other means, including government auctions. we may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and may involve significant expenditures. although the fcc is conducting an auction for low band spectrum, in which we are participating, gaining access to that spectrum may take up to three years or more. any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plans and efforts to improve our network. in addition, our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customers and to provide additional services and usage to existing customers. as a result, the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be as much as we anticipate or take longer than expected. additionally, we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market, on favorable terms or at all.
the fcc may impose conditions on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum, including new restrictions or rules governing the use or access to current or future spectrum. this could increase pressure on capacity. additional conditions that may be imposed by the fcc include heightened build-out requirements, limited renewal rights, clearing obligations, or open access or net neutrality requirements that may make it less attractive or less economical to acquire spectrum. in addition, rules may be established for future government spectrum auctions that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configurations or coverage areas.
if we cannot acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise, if competitors acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide services competitive with our services, or if we cannot deploy services over acquired spectrum on a timely basis without burdensome conditions, at reasonable cost, and while maintaining network quality levels, then our ability to attract and retain customers and our associated financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
competition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we have multiple wireless competitors, some of which have greater resources than us and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings; price; network coverage, speed and quality; and customer service. we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry's customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rates or possibly negative, leading to ongoing competition for customers. customer churn may increase as the wireless industry shifts away from service contracts. we also expect that our customers' appetite for data services will place increasing demands on our network capacity. this competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. our ability to compete will depend on, among other things, continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer services, effective marketing and selling of products and services, attractive pricing, and cost management, all of which will involve significant expenses.
joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitors competing for a limited number of customers. the two largest national wireless communication providers currently serve a significant percentage of all wireless customers and hold significant spectrum and other resources. our largest competitors may be able to enter into exclusive handset, device, or content arrangements, execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaigns, or otherwise improve their cost position relative to ours. in addition, refusal of our large competitors to provide critical access to resources and inputs, such as roaming services on reasonable terms, could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile services industry.
we are also facing competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, such as telecom services and content; satellite, wireless, and fiber; and other service providers. companies like comcast and at&t/directv (and at&t's proposed acquisition of time warner) will have the scale and assets to aggressively compete in a converging industry. verizon is also a significant competitor focusing on premium content offerings as well as acquisitions and proposed acquisitions like aol and yahoo to diversify outside of core wireless. further, some of our competitors now provide content services in addition to voice and broadband services, and consumers are increasingly accessing video content from internet-based providers and applications, all of which create increased competition in this area. these factors, together with the effects of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless services in all metropolitan areas and the ability of our larger competitors to use resources to build out their networks and to quickly deploy advanced technologies, could make it more difficult for us to continue to attract and retain customers, and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
10
if we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy.
significant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry. in general, these technological changes enhance communications and enable a broader array of companies to offer services competitive with ours. in order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technologies in our industry, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, continually invest in our network, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers' changing demands. enhancing our network, such as deploying 5g, is subject to risk from equipment changes and migration of customers from existing spectrum bands and the potential inability to secure spectrum necessary to deploy advanced technologies. adopting new and sophisticated technologies may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities, which in turn could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades. in general, the development of new services in the wireless telecommunications industry will require us to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demands of our customers, which we may not be able to do accurately or timely. we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and operating results if our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated.
we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches, whether directly or by way of third parties.
our business, like that of most retailers and wireless companies, involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information, including sensitive personal information and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our company, such as our business plans, transactions and intellectual property ("confidential information"). unauthorized access may be difficult to anticipate, detect, or prevent, particularly given that the methods of unauthorized access constantly change and evolve. we may experience unauthorized access or distribution of confidential information by third parties or employees, errors or breaches by third party suppliers, or other breaches of security that compromise the integrity of confidential information, and such breaches can have a materially adverse effect on our business or damage our reputation.
in addition, cyber-attacks, such as denial of service and other malicious attacks, could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, and have other adverse effects on our business and that of others who depend on our services. as a telecommunications carrier, we are considered a critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attacks. such attacks against companies may be perpetrated by a variety of groups or persons, including those in jurisdictions where u.s. law enforcement is or has been unable to effectively address such attacks.
in addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third-party service providers when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. we and our third-party service providers have been subject to unauthorized access to confidential information in the past, including a breach at one of our credit check providers in september 2015 in which a subset of records containing current and potential customer information was compromised by an external party.
although we regularly review our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services, the ever-evolving threat landscape requires us to continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes. we cannot assure you that the preventive actions we take will be adequate to repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches or the misuses of data, unauthorized access by third parties or employees, or exploits against third-party supplier environments. if we are subject to such attacks or compromise, we may incur significant costs, be subject to regulatory investigations, sanctions and private litigation, experience disruptions to our operations or suffer damage to our reputation. although the cyber-attacks that we and our third-party service providers have been subjected to in the past have not caused significant harm to our company, future cyber-attacks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
system failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems which could be materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.
to be successful, we must provide our customers with reliable, trustworthy service and protect the communications, location, and personal information shared or generated by our customers. we rely upon both our systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers to provide and support our services and, in some cases, protect our customers' and our information. failure of our or others' systems, networks, or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or for the compromise of
11
customer information. examples of these risks include:
•   human error such as responding to deceptive communications or unintentionally executing malicious code;
•   physical damage, power surges or outages, or equipment failure, including those as a result of severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and acts of war;
•   theft of customer and/or proprietary information offered for sale for competitive advantage or corporate extortion;
•   unauthorized access to our it and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers;
•   supplier failures or delays; and
•   system failures or outages of our business systems or communications network.
such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational and goodwill damages, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation. remediation costs could include liability for information loss, repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers. our insurance may not cover, or be adequate to fully reimburse us for, costs and losses associated with such events.
we are in the process of implementing a new billing system, which will support a portion of our subscribers, while maintaining our legacy billing system. any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business.
we are currently implementing a new customer billing system, which involves a new third-party supported platform and utilization of a phased deployment approach. post implementation, we plan to operate both the existing and new billing systems in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phases of the conversion are complete.
the implementation may cause major system or business disruptions, or we may fail to implement the new billing system in a timely or effective manner. in addition, the third-party billing services supporting vendor may experience errors, cyber-attacks, or other operational disruptions that could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control. interruptions and/or failure of this new billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers, or negatively impact overall customer experience. any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and reputational damage.
we rely on third parties to provide products or services for the operation of our business, and a failure or inability by such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we depend heavily on suppliers, their subcontractors, and other third parties in order for us to efficiently operate our business. our business is complex, and it is not unusual for multiple vendors located in multiple locations to help us to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services, such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. our suppliers may provide services outside of the united states, which carries associated additional regulatory and legal obligations. we generally rely upon the suppliers to provide contractual assurances and accurate information regarding risks associated with their provision of products or services in accordance with our expectations and standards such as our supplier code of conduct and our third party-risk management standard, and they may fail to do so.
generally, there are multiple sources for the types of products and services we purchase or use. however, we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for billing services, voice and data communications transport services, network infrastructure, equipment, handsets, other devices, and payment processing services, among other products and services. disruptions or failure of such suppliers to adequately perform could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial performance.
in the past, our suppliers, contractors and third-party retailers may not have always performed at the levels we expected or at the levels required by their contracts. our business could be severely disrupted if key suppliers, contractors, service providers, or third-party retailers fail to comply with their contracts or become unable to continue the supply due to patent or other intellectual property infringement actions or other disruptions. our business could also be disrupted if we experience delays or service degradation during any transition to a new outsourcing provider or other supplier or we were required to replace the supplied products or services with those from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
12
economic, political, and market conditions may adversely affect our business and financial performance, as well as our access to financing on favorable terms or at all.
our business and financial performance are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, including interest rates, consumer credit conditions, consumer debt levels, consumer confidence, rates of inflation (or concerns about deflation), unemployment rates, economic growth, energy costs, and other macro-economic factors. difficult, or worsening, general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
market volatility, political and economic uncertainty, and weak economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance in a number of ways. our services are available to a broad customer base, a significant segment of which may be more vulnerable to weak economic conditions. we may have greater difficulty in gaining new customers within this segment, and existing customers may be more likely to terminate service due to an inability to pay.
weak economic conditions and credit conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers and dealers, some of which have filed for or may be considering bankruptcy, or may experience cash flow or liquidity problems, or are unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate. any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.
in addition, instability in the global financial markets could lead to periodic volatility in the credit, equity, and fixed income markets. this volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.
the agreements governing our indebtedness and other financing arrangements include restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility.
the agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions, subject in certain cases to customary baskets, exceptions, and incurrence-based ratio tests, may limit our or our subsidiaries' ability to engage in some transactions, including the following:
•   incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock;
•   paying dividends, redeeming capital stock, or making other restricted payments or investments;
•   selling or buying assets, properties, or licenses, including participating in future fcc auctions of spectrum or private sales of spectrum;
•   developing assets, properties, or licenses that we have or in the future may procure;
•   creating liens on assets;
•   engaging in mergers, acquisitions, business combinations, or other transactions;
•   entering into transactions with affiliates; and
•   placing restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments.
these restrictions could limit our ability to react to changes in our operating environment or the economy. any future indebtedness that we incur may contain similar or more restrictive covenants. any failure to comply with the restrictions of our debt agreements may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these agreements and other agreements, giving our lenders the right to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds and to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding. any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
our ability to make payments on our debt, to repay our existing indebtedness when due, and to fund our capital intensive business and operations, and significant planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is in turn subject to the operational risks described elsewhere in this report. our debt service obligations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results, including by:
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the communications industry or pursuing growth opportunities;
•   reducing the amount of cash available for other operational or strategic needs; and
13
•   placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors who are less leveraged than we are.
some of our debt also has a floating rate of interest linked to various indices. if the resets or the change in indices result in interest rate increases, debt service requirements will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. while we have and may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates in the future, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk, and any portion not subject to such agreements would have full exposure to higher interest rates. any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act could result in a loss of investor confidence regarding our financial statements or may have a material adverse effect on our business.
under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, we along with our independently registered public accounting firm are required to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. we rely heavily on it systems as an important part of our internal controls in order to operate, transact, and otherwise manage our business, as well as provide effective and timely reporting of our financial results. failure to design and maintain effective internal controls, including those over our it systems, could constitute a material weakness that could result in inaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent fraud. if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls, investor confidence regarding our financial statements and our business could be materially adversely affected.
our financial performance will be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing, credit cards, dealers, or subscriptions.
our operating costs could increase substantially as a result of fraud, including device financing, customer credit card, subscription, or dealer fraud. if our fraud detection strategies and processes are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud, whether directly or by way of the systems, processes, and operations of third parties such as national retailers, dealers, and others, the resulting loss of revenue or increased expenses could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.
we rely on highly-skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture.
the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. we believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, changes to u.s. immigration policy, competitors' hiring practices, employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demands on our company and our industry, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees and to attract new employees. if we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, we may not be able to meet our business plan and, as a result, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.
any acquisition, investment, or merger may subject us to significant risks, any of which may harm our business.
we may pursue acquisitions of, investments in or mergers with businesses, technologies, services and/or products that complement or expand our business. some of these potential transactions could be significant relative to the size of our business and operations. any such transaction would involve a number of risks and could present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including:
•   diversion of management attention from running our existing business;
•   increased costs to integrate the networks, spectrum, technology, personnel, customer base and business practices of the business involved in any such transaction with our business;
•   difficulties in effectively integrating the financial and operational reporting systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;
•   potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;
•   significant transaction expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;
14
•   risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction;
•   acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings; and
•   any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from our transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.
for any or all of these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, or merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
risks related to legal and regulatory matters changes in regulations or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or operating results.
the fcc regulates the licensing, construction, modification, operation, ownership, sale, and interconnection of wireless communications systems, as do some state and local regulatory agencies. in particular, the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands. additionally, the ftc and other federal agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection, and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of wireless products and services. we are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal, state and local agencies, as well as judicial review and actions, on issues related to the wireless industry that include, but are not limited to: roaming, spectrum allocation and licensing, facilities siting, pole attachments, intercarrier compensation, universal service fund ("usf"), net neutrality, special access, 911 services, consumer protection, consumer privacy, and cybersecurity. we are also subject to regulations in connection with other aspects of our business, including handset financing and insurance activities.
we cannot assure you that the fcc or any other federal, state or local agencies will not adopt regulations or take other enforcement or other actions that would adversely affect our business, impose new costs, or require changes in current or planned operations. for example, in june 2015, the fcc's new net neutrality rules became effective, with the exception of enhanced transparency requirements, a portion of which became effective january 2017. in 2016, the fcc also adopted a new broadband privacy regime that applies to our operations. both sets of rules potentially subject some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant.
in addition, states are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communication providers provide to their customers and several states have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulations in this area. we also face potential investigations by, and inquiries from or actions by state public utility commissions. we also cannot assure you that congress will not amend the communications act, from which the fcc obtains its authority and which serves to limit state authority, or enact other legislation in a manner that could be adverse to our business.
failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. we could be subject to fines, forfeitures, and other penalties (including, in extreme cases, revocation of our spectrum licenses) for failure to comply with fcc or other governmental regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. the loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
unfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and financial condition.
we are regularly involved in a number of legal proceedings before various state and federal courts, the fcc, the ftc, other federal agencies, and state and local regulatory agencies, including state attorneys general. such legal proceedings can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel. the assessment of the outcome of legal proceedings, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control. the amounts ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment, order or decree may differ materially from amounts accrued in our financial statements. in addition, litigation or similar proceedings could impose restraints on our current or future manner of doing business. such potential outcomes including judgments, awards, settlements or orders could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or ability to do business.
15
we offer highly regulated financial services products. these products expose us to a wide variety of state and federal regulations.
the financing of devices, including through our eip and jump! on demand programs, has expanded our regulatory compliance obligations. if we fail to remain compliant with any of these regulations, then we face the risk of:
•   increased consumer complaints and potential examinations or enforcement actions by federal and state regulatory agencies, including but not limited to the consumer financial protection board, the fcc and the ftc;
•   violation of financial services and consumer protections regulations may result in regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions, civil litigation, and/or class action lawsuits.
failure to comply with applicable regulations and the realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.
we rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which offer only limited protection. the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary rights. we may not have the ability in certain jurisdictions to adequately protect intellectual property rights. moreover, others may independently develop processes and technologies that are competitive to ours. also, we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of protecting these rights or reduce our revenues. we cannot be sure that any legal actions against such infringers will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. we cannot assure you that our pending or future patent applications will be granted or enforceable, or that the rights granted under any patent that may be issued will provide us with any competitive advantages. in addition, we cannot assure you that any trademark or service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or will provide adequate protection of our brands. we do not have insurance coverage for intellectual property losses, and as such, a charge for an anticipated settlement or an adverse ruling awarding damages represents unplanned loss events. any of these factors could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. we are a defendant in numerous intellectual property lawsuits, including patent infringement lawsuits, which exposes us to the risk of adverse financial impact either by way of significant settlement amounts or damage awards. as we adopt new technologies and new business systems, and provide customers with new products and/or services, we may face additional infringement claims. these claims could require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling relevant products and services. these claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend, and divert management resources, and expose us to significant damages awards or settlements, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. in addition to litigation directly involving our company, our vendors and suppliers can be threatened with patent litigation and/or subjected to the threat of disruption or blockage of sale, use, or importation of products, posing the risk of supply chain interruption to particular products and associated services exposing us to material adverse operational and financial impacts.
our business may be impacted by new or changing tax laws or regulations and actions by federal, state, and/or local agencies, or how judicial authorities apply tax laws.
in connection with the products and services we sell, we calculate, collect, and remit various federal, state, and local taxes, surcharges and regulatory fees ("tax" or "taxes") to numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities, including federal usf contributions and common carrier regulatory fees. in addition, we incur and pay state and local taxes and fees on purchases of goods and services used in our business.
tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. in many cases, the application of tax laws are uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services, such as broadband internet access and cloud related services. changes in tax laws could impact revenue on tax inclusive plans.
in the event that we have incorrectly described, disclosed, calculated, assessed, or remitted amounts that were due to governmental authorities, we could be subject to additional taxes, fines, penalties, or other adverse actions, which could materially impact our operations or financial condition. in the event that federal, state, and/or local municipalities were to
16
significantly increase taxes on our network, operations, or services, or seek to impose new taxes, it could have a material adverse effect on our margins and financial and operational results.
our wireless licenses are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable laws.
our existing wireless licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the 10-year or 15-year period for which they are granted. historically, the fcc has approved our license renewal applications. however, the communications act provides that licenses may be revoked for cause and license renewal applications denied if the fcc determines that a renewal would not serve the public interest. in addition, our licenses are subject to our compliance with the terms set forth in the agreement pertaining to national security among deutsche telekom, the federal bureau of investigation, the department of justice, the department of homeland security and the company. the failure of deutsche telekom or the company to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation or non-renewal of our spectrum licenses. if we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirements for renewal, including construction and substantial service requirements, we could be denied a license renewal. many of our wireless licenses are subject to interim or final construction requirements and there is no guarantee that the fcc will find our construction, or the construction of prior licensees, sufficient to meet the build-out or renewal requirements. the fcc has pending a rulemaking proceeding to reevaluate, among other things, its wireless license renewal showings and standards and may in this or other proceedings promulgate changes or additional substantial requirements or conditions to its renewal rules, including revising license build out requirements. accordingly, we cannot assure you that the fcc will renew our wireless licenses upon their expiration. if any of our wireless licenses were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration, we would not be permitted to provide services under that license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our business could be adversely affected by findings of product liability for health/safety risks from wireless devices and transmission equipment, as well as by changes to regulations/radio frequency emission standards.
we do not manufacture the devices or other equipment that we sell, and we depend on our suppliers to provide defect-free and safe equipment. suppliers are required by applicable law to manufacture their devices to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criteria. however, even if the devices we sell meet the regulatory safety criteria, we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturers and suppliers for any harm caused by products we sell if such products are later found to have design or manufacturing defects. we generally seek to enter into indemnification agreements with the manufacturers who supply us with devices to protect us from losses associated with product liability, but we cannot guarantee that we will be fully protected against all losses associated with a product that is found to be defective.
allegations have been made that the use of wireless handsets and wireless transmission equipment, such as cell towers, may be linked to various health concerns, including cancer and brain tumors. lawsuits have been filed against manufacturers and carriers in the industry claiming damages for alleged health problems arising from the use of wireless handsets. in addition, the fcc has from time to time gathered data regarding wireless handset emissions and its assessment of this issue may evolve based on its findings. the media has also reported incidents of handset battery malfunction, including reports of batteries that have overheated. these allegations may lead to changes in regulatory standards. there have also been other allegations regarding wireless technology, including allegations that wireless handset emissions may interfere with various electronic medical devices (including hearing aids and pacemakers), airbags and anti-lock brakes. defects in the products of our suppliers, such the recent recalls by a handset original equipment manufacturer ("oem") on one of its smartphone devices, could have an adverse impact on our operating results.
additionally, there are safety risks associated with the use of wireless devices while operating vehicles or equipment. concerns over any of these risks and the effect of any legislation, rules or regulations that have been and may be adopted in response to these risks could limit our ability to sell our wireless services.
related to ownership of our common stock we are controlled by deutsche telekom, whose interests may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.
deutsche telekom beneficially owns and possesses majority voting power of the fully diluted shares of our common stock.
through its control of the voting power of our common stock and the rights granted to deutsche telekom in our certificate of incorporation and the stockholder's agreement, deutsche telekom controls the election of our directors and all other matters requiring the approval of our stockholders. by virtue of deutsche telekom's voting control, we are a "controlled company," as defined in the nasdaq listing rules, and are not subject to nasdaq requirements that would otherwise require us to have a
17
majority of independent directors, a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors. accordingly, our stockholders will not be afforded the same protections generally as stockholders of other nasdaq-listed companies with respect to corporate governance for so long as we rely on these exemptions from the corporate governance requirements.
in addition, our certificate of incorporation and the stockholder's agreement restrict us from taking certain actions without deutsche telekom's prior written consent as long as deutsche telekom beneficially owns 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, including:
•   the incurrence of debt (excluding certain permitted debt) if our consolidated ratio of debt to cash flow for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which financial statements are available would exceed 5.25 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis;
•   the acquisition of any business, debt or equity interests, operations or assets of any person for consideration in excess of $1 billion;
•   the sale of any of our or our subsidiaries' divisions, businesses, operations or equity interests for consideration in excess of $1 billion;
•   any change in the size of our board of directors;
•   the issuances of equity securities in excess of 10% of our outstanding shares or to repurchase debt held by deutsche telekom;
•   the repurchase or redemption of equity securities or the declaration of extraordinary or in-kind dividends or distributions other than on a pro rata basis; or
•   the termination or hiring of our chief executive officer.
these restrictions could prevent us from taking actions that our board of directors may otherwise determine are in the best interests of the company and our stockholders or that may be in the best interests of our other stockholders.
deutsche telekom effectively has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, changes to our certificate of incorporation, a sale or merger of our company and other transactions requiring stockholder approval under delaware law. deutsche telekom's controlling interest may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, the company. deutsche telekom may have strategic, financial, or other interests different from our other stockholders, including as the holder of a substantial amount of our indebtedness and as the counter-party in a number of commercial arrangements, and may make decisions adverse to the interests of our other stakeholders.
future sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales by deutsche telekom, could have a negative impact on our stock price.
we cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the availability of shares of our common stock will have on the prevailing trading price of our common stock from time to time. sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline and could result in dilution of your shares.
we and deutsche telekom are parties to the stockholder's agreement pursuant to which deutsche telekom is free to transfer its shares in public sales without notice, as long as such transactions would not result in the transferee owning 30% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock. if a transfer would exceed the 30% threshold, it is prohibited unless the transferee makes a binding offer to purchase all of the other outstanding shares on the same price and terms. the stockholder's agreement does not otherwise impose any other restrictions on the sales of common stock by deutsche telekom. moreover, we have filed a shelf registration statement with respect to the common stock and certain debt securities held by deutsche telekom, which would facilitate the resale by deutsche telekom of all or any portion of the shares of our common stock it holds. the sale of shares of our common stock by deutsche telekom (other than in transactions involving the purchase of all of our outstanding shares) could significantly increase the number of shares available in the market, which could cause a decrease in our stock price. in addition, even if deutsche telekom does not sell a large number of its shares into the market, its right to transfer a large number of shares into the market may depress our stock price.
in addition, we have reserved up to 38.684 million shares of common stock for issuance upon conversion of our preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. the dividends on the preferred stock may also be paid in cash or, subject to certain limitations, shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock. the issuance of additional shares of common stock upon conversion of, or in connection with the payment of dividends upon, the mandatory
18
convertible preferred stock may depress our stock price.
our stock price may be volatile, and may fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.
the trading prices of the securities of communications companies historically have been highly volatile, and the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations. our stock price may fluctuate in reaction to a number of events and factors that may include, among other things:
•   our or our competitors' actual or anticipated operating and financial results; introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors or changes in service plans or pricing by us or our competitors;
•   analyst projections, predictions and forecasts, analyst target prices for our securities and changes in, or our failure to meet, securities analysts' expectations;
•   transaction in our common stock by major investors;
•   deutsche telekom's financial performance, results of operation, or actions implied or taken by deutsche telekom;
•   entry of new competitors into our markets or perceptions of increased price competition, including a price war;
•   our performance, including subscriber growth, and our financial and operational metric performance;
•   market perceptions relating to our services, network, handsets, and deployment of our lte platform and our access to iconic handsets, services, applications, or content;
•   market perceptions of the wireless communications industry and valuation models for us and the industry;
•   conditions or trends in the internet and the industry sectors we operate in;
•   changes in our credit rating or future prospects;
•   changes in interest rates;
•   changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;
•   the availability or perceived availability of additional capital in general and our access to such capital;
•   actual or anticipated consolidation, or other strategic mergers or acquisition activities involving us or our competitors, or other participants in related or adjacent industries, or market speculations regarding such activities;
•   disruptions of our operations or service providers or other vendors necessary to our network operations;
•   the general state of the u.s. and world politics and economies, including changes in interest rates; and
•   availability of additional spectrum, whether by the announcement, commencement, bidding and closing of auctions for new spectrum or the acquisition of companies that own spectrum, and the extent to which we or our competitors succeed in acquiring additional spectrum.
in addition, the stock market has been volatile in the recent past and has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which may continue for the foreseeable future. this volatility has had a significant impact on the trading price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the communications industry. these changes frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected companies. hence, the trading price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our business, financial condition and operating results.
we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock. in addition, no dividend may be declared or paid on our common stock, other than dividends payable solely in shares of our common stock, unless all accrued dividends for all completed dividend periods have been declared and paid on our preferred stock. other than to pay dividends on our preferred stock, we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to invest in our business.
our stockholder rights plan could prevent a change in control of our company in instances in which some stockholders may believe a change in control is in their best interests.
we have a stockholder rights plan ("rights plan") in effect that will expire in march 2017, unless renewed. the rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire our company on terms that our board of directors
19
does not believe are in our and our stockholders' best interest. the rights plan is intended to protect stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire the company and to provide our board of directors with adequate time to evaluate unsolicited offers. the rights plan may prevent or make takeovers or unsolicited corporate transactions with respect to our company more difficult, even if stockholders may consider such transactions favorable, possibly including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the objectives of our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") are to provide users of our consolidated financial statements with the following:
•   a narrative explanation from the perspective of management of our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results;
•   context to the financial statements; and
•   information that allows assessment of the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.
our md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read together with, our audited consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december 31, 2016 included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k. except as expressly stated, the financial condition and results of operations discussed throughout our md&a are those of t-mobile us, inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
business overview we introduced our un-carrier strategy in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. since that time, we have continued our efforts with the launch of additional initiatives of our un-carrier strategy. during 2016, we launched the following un-carrier initiatives:
•   in june 2016, we introduced #getthanked, a history-making move dedicated exclusively to saying "thank you" to our customers. this program, offered to our customers as part of their t-mobile service: (i) offers eligible new (through december 31, 2016) or existing (as of june 6, 2016) customers ownership in the company with a free share of t-
23
mobile stock or an additional share of t-mobile stock for every new active account each customer refers through december 31, 2016, subject to a maximum of 100 shares in a calendar year, (ii) enables eligible customers who download the t-mobile tuesday app to be informed about and to redeem products and services offered by participating business partners each tuesday and (iii) offers eligible customers a full hour of free in-flight wi-fi on their smartphone on all gogo-equipped domestic flights.
•   in september 2016, we introduced our t-mobile one plan, a move that gives our customers unlimited calls, unlimited text and unlimited high-speed 4g long term evolution (lte) data. on t-mobile one, video typically streams at dvd (480p) quality and tethering is at maximum 3g speeds. customers can choose to add on additional features to t-mobile one for an additional cost. on t-mobile one plus customers also receive unlimited high definition video day passes, voicemail to text, nameid, unlimited gogo in-flight internet passes on capable domestic flights and up to two times faster speeds when traveling abroad in 140+ countries and destinations. on t-mobile one plus international, customers receive the benefits of t-mobile one plus as well as free and reduced calling from the u.s. to foreign countries and unlimited high-speed 4g lte mobile hotspot data.
•   in january 2017, we introduced, un-carrier next, where monthly wireless service fees and all taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for t-mobile one. we also unveiled kickback on t-mobile one, where participating customers who use 2 gb or less of data in a month, will get up to a $10 credit on their next month's bill per qualifying line. in addition, we introduced the un-contract for t-mobile one with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4g lte plan which allows t-mobile one customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.
our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.

during the year ended december 31, 2016, a handset oem announced recalls on certain of its smartphone devices. as a result, we recorded no revenue associated with the device sales to customers and impaired the devices to their net realizable value. the oem has agreed to reimburse t-mobile for direct and indirect costs associated with the recall, as such, we have recorded an amount due from the oem as an offset to the loss recorded in cost of equipment sales and the costs incurred within selling, general and administrative in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and a reduction to accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

results of operations
2016 highlights
•   total revenues increased $5.2 billion, or 16%, to $37.2 billion in 2016 primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues as further discussed below. the mvno transaction shifted branded postpaid revenues to wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues.
•   service revenues increased $3.0 billion, or 12%, to $27.8 billion in 2016 primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the success of our metropcs brand and continued growth in new markets.
•   equipment revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 30%, to $8.7 billion in 2016 primarily as a result of higher lease revenues, which are recognized over the lease term, resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015, an increase in the number of devices sold and a higher average revenue per device sold.
•   operating income increased $1.7 billion, or 84%, to $3.8 billion in 2016 primarily due to higher total revenues as well as increased gains on disposals of spectrum licenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization from an increase in the number of devices leased under our jump! on demand program, higher costs of equipment sales primarily from an increase in the number of devices sold and a higher average cost per device and higher selling, general and administrative expenses to support customer growth and retention.
•   net income increased $727 million, or 99%, to $1.5 billion in 2016 primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by higher interest expense related to higher average debt and higher income tax expense. additionally, 2016 included $509 million of net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses compared to $100 million in 2015.
•   adjusted ebitda increased $3.0 billion, or 41%, to $10.4 billion in 2016 primarily from higher service revenues and gains on disposal of spectrum licenses, partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses to support customer growth. lower losses on equipment in 2016 primarily due to an increase in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. revenues associated with leased devices are recognized over the lease term.
•   net cash provided by operating activities increased $721 million, or 13%, to $6.1 billion in 2016. the increase was primarily due to an increase in net non-cash income and expenses included in net income primarily due to changes in depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax expense and gains on disposal of spectrum licenses expense, as well as an increase in net income. the increase was partially offset by an increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital.
•   free cash flow increased $743 million, or 108%, to $1.4 billion in 2016. the increase was primarily from higher net cash provided by operating activities as discussed above. cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $142 million and $246 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

nm - not meaningful comparing 2016 results with 2015 results total revenues increased $5.2 billion or 16% primarily due to:
branded postpaid revenues increased $1.8 billion or 11% primarily from:
•   a 13% increase in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers, driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices;
•   higher device insurance program revenues primarily from customer growth; and
•   higher regulatory program revenues; partially offset by
•   an increase in the non-cash net revenue deferral for data stash; and
•   the impact of reduced branded postpaid revenues resulting from the mvno transaction.
26
branded prepaid revenues increased $1.0 billion or 13% primarily from:
•   a 13% increase in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our metropcs brand; and
•   continued growth in new markets.
wholesale revenues increased $211 million or 30% primarily from:
•   the impact of the increased wholesale revenues resulting from the mvno transaction;
•   growth in customers of certain mvno partners; and
•   an increase in data usage per customer.
roaming and other service revenues increased $57 million or 30% primarily due to higher international roaming revenues driven by an increase in inbound roaming volumes.
equipment revenues increased $2.0 billion or 30% primarily from:
•   an increase of $1.2 billion in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. revenues associated with leased devices are recognized over the lease term.
•   an increase of $570 million in device sales revenues, primarily due to a 9% increase in the number of devices sold. device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale.
gross eip device financing to our customers increased by $923 million to $6.1 billion primarily due to an increase in devices financed due to our focus on eip sales in 2016, compared to focus on devices financed on jump! on demand after the launch of the program at the end of the second quarter of 2015.
other revenues increased $157 million or 31% primarily from:
•   higher revenue from revenue share agreements with third parties; and
•   an increase in co-location rental income from leasing space on wireless communication towers to third parties.
our operating expenses consist of the following categories:
•   cost of services consists primarily of costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs.
•   cost of equipment sales consists primarily of costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, costs related to returned and purchased leased devices, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.
•   selling, general and administrative consists of costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. these include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, losses from sales of receivables and back office administrative support activities.
operating expenses increased $3.5 billion or 12% primarily due to:
cost of services increased $177 million or 3% primarily from:
•   higher regulatory program costs and expenses associated with network expansion and the build-out of our network to utilize our 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses, including higher employee-related costs; partially offset by
•   lower long distance and toll costs; and
•   synergies realized from the decommissioning of the metropcs cdma network.
27
cost of equipment sales increased $1.5 billion or 16% primarily from:
•   a 9% increase in the number of devices sold; and
•   an increase in the impact from returned and purchased leased devices.
under our jump! on demand program, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. additionally, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device.  returned devices transferred from property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.
selling, general and administrative increased $1.2 billion or 12% primarily from strategic investments to support our growing customer base including higher:
•   employee-related costs;
•   commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions; and
•   promotional costs.
depreciation and amortization increased $1.6 billion or 33% primarily from:
•   $1.5 billion in depreciation expense related to devices leased under our jump! on demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015. under our jump! on demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value. the total number of devices under lease was higher year-over-year, resulting in higher depreciation expense; and
•   the continued build-out of our 4g lte network.
cost of metropcs business combination decreased $272 million or 72% primarily from lower network decommissioning costs. in 2014, we began decommissioning the metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant network cell sites as part of the business combination. on july 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the metropcs cdma network. network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from adjusted ebitda, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. although we expect to incur additional network decommissioning costs in 2017, these costs are not expected to be significant.
gains on disposal of spectrum licenses increased $672 million primarily from a $636 million gain from a spectrum license transaction with at&t recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and $199 million from other transactions in 2016, compared to $163 million in 2015. see note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
net income increased $727 million or 99% primarily from:
•   operating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $1.7 billion or 84% and
•   interest expense to affiliates decreased $99 million or 24% primarily from:
•   changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with our senior reset notes issued to deutsch telekom in 2015; partially offset by
•   higher interest rates on certain senior reset notes issued to deutsch telekom, which were adjusted at reset dates in the second quarter of 2016 and in 2015. partially offset by:
•   income tax expense increased $622 million or 254% primarily from:
•   higher income before income taxes; and
•   a higher effective tax rate. the effective tax rate was 37.3% in 2016, compared to 25.1% in 2015. the increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to income tax benefits for discrete income tax items recognized in 2015 that did not impact 2016; partially offset by the recognition of $58 million of excess
28
tax benefits related to share-based payments following the adoption of asu 2016-09 as of january 1, 2016. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. based on recent earnings in certain jurisdictions, sufficient positive evidence may exist within the next twelve months such that we may release a portion of our valuation allowance.
•   interest expense increased $333 million or 31% primarily from:
•   higher average debt balances with third parties; and
•   lower capitalized interest costs of $83 million primarily due to a higher level of build out of our network to utilize our 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses in 2015, compared to 2016.
•   interest income decreased $159 million or 38% primarily due to $166 million lower imputed interest income associated with devices financed through eip resulting from:
•   an increase in sales of certain eip receivables pursuant to our eip receivables sales arrangement resulting from an increase in the maximum funding commitment in june 2016. interest associated with eip receivables is imputed at the time of a device sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. see note 2 - equipment installment plan receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements; and
•   focus on devices financed on jump! on demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 following the launch of the program of at the end of the second quarter 2015.
we are making an accounting change in 2017 to include imputed interest associated with eip receivables in other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. the impact from this accounting change is expected to be approximately $0.2 to $0.3 billion in 2017.
net income during 2016 and 2015 included net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $509 million and $100 million, respectively.

comparing 2015 results with 2014 results total revenues increased $2.5 billion or 8% primarily due to:
branded postpaid revenues increased $2.0 billion or 14% primarily from:
•   growth in the number of average branded postpaid and mobile broadband customers, driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices;
•   increased customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs; and
•   increased regulatory program revenues; partially offset by
•   lower branded postpaid phone arpu.
branded prepaid revenues increased $567 million or 8% primarily from:
•   growth in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our metropcs brand promotional activities; and
•   continued growth in expansion markets.
wholesale revenues decreased $39 million or 5% primarily from:
•   revised agreements with certain mvno partners in 2015; partially offset by
•   growth in customers of certain mvno partners.
roaming and other service revenues decreased $73 million or 27% primarily from:
•   lower international roaming revenues driven by changes in contractual arrangements with certain roaming partners; and
•   a reduction in early termination fees.
equipment revenues decreased $71 million or 1% primarily from:
•   lower average revenue per device sold, due in part to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices under our jump! on demand program; partially offset by
•   growth in the number of devices and accessories sold.
with jump! on demand, revenues associated with leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease rather than when the device is delivered to the customer. despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of jump! on demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.
we financed $5.2 billion of devices through eip during 2015, a decrease from $5.8 billion in 2014, primarily due to a decline in devices financed through eip as customers increasingly shifted to leasing devices with jump! on demand.
other revenues increased $114 million or 29% primarily attributable to higher non-service revenues from revenue share agreements with third parties.
operating expenses increased $1.8 billion or 7% primarily due to:
cost of services decreased $234 million or 4% primarily from:
•   synergies realized from the decommissioning of the metropcs cdma network;
•   lower lease expense associated with spectrum license lease agreements; and
•   a reduction in certain regulatory program costs; partially offset by
•   increases related to our network expansion and build-out of our 700 mhz a-block spectrum.
30
cost of equipment sales decreased $277 million or 3% primarily from:
•   lower average cost per device sold, mainly due to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices with jump! on demand; partially offset by
•   growth in the number of devices and accessories sold.
with jump! on demand, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of jump! on demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.
selling, general and administrative increased $1.3 billion or 15% primarily from supporting the growing customer base, which also increased 15% and reflects increases in:
•   employee-related costs;
•   promotional costs;
•   commissions; and
•   bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables primarily resulting from growth in the customer base and in the eip program.
depreciation and amortization increased $276 million or 6% primarily from $312 million in depreciation expense related to devices leased under our jump! on demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015. under our jump! on demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value. the total number of devices under lease was higher year-over-year, resulting in higher depreciation expense.
cost of metropcs business combination increased $77 million or 26% primarily from higher network decommissioning costs associated with the business combination. in 2014, we began decommissioning the metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant network cell sites. on july 1, 2015, t-mobile officially completed the shutdown of the metropcs cdma network. network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from adjusted ebitda, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites.
gains on disposal of spectrum licenses decreased $677 million or 81% primarily from:
•   $163 million in 2015 which primarily consisted of a non-cash gain of $139 million from spectrum license transactions with verizon recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015; as compared to
•   $840 million in 2014 which primarily consisted of non-cash gains from spectrum license transactions with verizon, and to a lesser extent, a non-cash gain from a spectrum license transaction with at&amp;t during the fourth quarter of 2014.

•   interest income increased $61 million or 17% primarily attributable to higher interest income from devices financed through eip. interest associated with eip receivables is imputed at the time of sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. partially offset by:
•   interest expense to affiliates increased $133 million or 48% primarily from:
•   changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with the senior reset notes issued to deutsche telekom; partially offset by
•   lower capitalized interest costs associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses.
31
•   income tax expense increased $79 million or 48% primarily from:
•   higher income before income taxes; partially offset by
•   a lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rate was 25.1% in 2015, compared to 40.2% in 2014. the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of discrete income tax items recognized in 2015, including changes in state and local income tax laws and the recognition of foreign tax credits.
•   interest expense increased $12 million or 1% primarily from:
•   higher debt balances with third parties; partially offset by
•   lower capitalized interest costs associated with the build out of our network to utilize our 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses.
net income during 2015 and 2014 included net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $100 million and $515 million, respectively.

the increases in service revenues, cost of equipment sales and selling, general and administrative were primarily the result of an increase in activity of the non-guarantor subsidiary that provides device insurance, primarily driven by growth in our customer base. all other results of operations of the parent, issuer and guarantor subsidiaries are substantially similar to our consolidated results of operations. see note 15 - guarantor financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
performance measures in managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-gaap financial measures. these operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.

the mvno transaction resulted in a transfer of 1,365,000 branded postpaid phone customers and 326,000 branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers on september 1, 2016. prospectively from september 1, 2016, net customer additions for these customers are included within wholesale customers. ending customers as of december 31, 2016 reflect the transfers in connection with the mvno transaction.
branded customers total branded net customer additions increased 780,000, or 13%, in 2016 primarily from:
•   higher branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to the success of our metropcs brand, continued growth in new markets and distribution expansion, partially offset by an increase in the number of qualified branded prepaid customers migrating to branded postpaid plans; partially offset by
•   lower branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions primarily due to higher deactivations resulting from churn on a growing branded postpaid mobile broadband customer base, partially offset by higher gross customer additions; and
•   lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower gross customer additions from higher deactivations on a growing customer base, partially offset by lower churn as well as an increase in the number of qualified branded prepaid customers migrating to branded postpaid plans as well as the optimization of our third-party distribution channels.
33
total branded net customer additions decreased 305,000, or 5%, in 2015 primarily from:
•   lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower gross customer additions in 2015, compared to 2014, which included the introduction of un-carrier 4.0 contract freedom and certain attractive family rate plan promotions, partially offset by approximately 765,000 qualified branded prepaid customers upgrading to branded postpaid plans in 2015, compared to approximately 420,000 in 2014; partially offset by
•   higher branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions driven by promotions for mobile broadband devices, partially offset by higher deactivations resulting from the discontinuation of certain promotional pricing for mobile broadband services and ongoing competitive activity in the marketplace; and
•   higher branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions driven by the success of our metropcs brand promotional activities and continued growth in new markets, partially offset by approximately 765,000 qualified branded prepaid customers upgrading to branded postpaid plans in 2015, compared to approximately 420,000 in 2014.
wholesale wholesale net customer additions decreased 871,000, or 36%, in 2016 primarily due to higher mvno deactivations from certain mvno partners. going forward, we expect wholesale net customer additions to be significantly lower in 2017, as our mvno partners deemphasize lifeline in favor of higher arpu customer categories.
wholesale net customer additions increased 235,000, or 11%, in 2015 primarily due to higher mvno gross customer additions, partially offset by higher mvno deactivations.
customers per account customers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. an account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers. we believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis.

churn churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. the number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. we believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.

branded prepaid churn decreased 31 basis points in 2015 primarily from a methodology change during 2015 that had no impact on our reported branded prepaid ending customers or net customer additions, but resulted in computationally lower gross customer additions and deactivations. revision of prior periods was not practicable because certain historical data was no longer available.
average revenue per user, average billings per user arpu represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. we believe arpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. branded postpaid phone arpu excludes mobile broadband customers and related revenues.
average billings per user ("abpu") represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and eip billings before securitization, per customer. we believe branded postpaid abpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.

net income margin represents net income divided by service revenues. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues.
adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. we use adjusted ebitda internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. management believes analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other nonrecurring expenses. adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the following table illustrates the calculation of adjusted ebitda and reconciles adjusted ebitda to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:

(1)   stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. gains on disposal of spectrum licenses may not agree to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income primarily due to certain routine operating activities, such as routine spectrum license exchanges that would be expected to reoccur, and are therefore included in adjusted ebitda. other, net may not agree to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur, and are therefore excluded in adjusted ebitda.
adjusted ebitda increased $3.0 billion, or 41%, in 2016 primarily from:
•   increased branded postpaid and prepaid service revenues primarily due to strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities;
•   higher gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $672 million; gains on disposal were $835 million in 2016 compared to $163 million in 2015;
•   lower losses on equipment in 2016 primarily due to an increase in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. additionally, the costs of leased devices, which are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term, are excluded from adjusted ebitda. in connection with jump! on demand, we had lease revenues of $1.4 billion in 2016, and depreciation expense of $1.5 billion related to leased wireless devices in 2016; and
•   focused cost control and synergies realized from the metropcs business combination, primarily in cost of services; partially offset by

•   higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to strategic investments to support our growing customer base, including higher employee-related costs, higher commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions and higher promotional costs.
we are making an accounting change in 2017 to include imputed interest associated with eip receivables in other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, which will be included in adjusted ebitda. the impact from this accounting change is expected to be approximately $0.2 to $0.3 billion in 2017.
adjusted ebitda increased $1.8 billion, or 31%, in 2015 primarily from:
•   increased branded postpaid and prepaid revenues driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities;
•   focused cost control and synergies realized from the metropcs business combination, especially in cost of services;
•   lower losses on equipment in 2015 primarily due to an increase in lease revenues, which are recognized over the lease term, resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand at the end of the second quarter of 2015. additionally, the costs of leased devices, which are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term, are excluded from adjusted ebitda. in connection with jump! on demand, we had lease revenues of $224 million in 2015, and depreciation expense of $312 million related to leased wireless devices in 2015; partially offset by
•   higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

•   $4.0 billion for purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets, including a $2.2 billion deposit made to a third party in connection with a potential asset purchase; partially offset by
•   $3.0 billion in sales of short-term investments.
cash used in investing activities increased $2.3 billion, or 32%, in 2015, to a use of $9.6 billion primarily from:
•   $4.7 billion for purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $246 million primarily related to the build out of our 4g lte network;
•   $1.9 billion for purchases of spectrum licenses and other intangible assets and
•   $3.0 billion in purchases of short-term investments.
financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased $3.0 billion, or 86%, in 2016 to an inflow of $463 million primarily from:
•   $997 million proceeds from issuance of long-term debt; partially offset by
•   $205 million for repayments of capital lease obligations;
•   $150 million for repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net; and
•   $121 million for tax withholdings on share-based awards.
cash provided by financing activities increased $889 million, or 35%, in 2015 to inflow of $3.4 billion primarily from:
•   $4.0 billion proceeds from issuance of long-term debt; partially offset by
•   $564 million for repayments of short-term debt for purchases of inventory, property and equipment, net.
cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were $5.5 billion.
free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of t-mobile's financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.
the following table illustrates the calculation of free cash flow and reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:
year ended december 31,                     2016 versus 2015                    2015 versus 2014

free cash flow increased $743 million in 2016 and increased $861 million for 2015 primarily from:
•   higher net cash provided by operating activities, as described above; and
•   lower purchases of property and equipment from the build-out of our 4g lte network in 2016, as described above. in 2015, purchases of property and equipment were higher compared to 2014 from the build-out of our 4g lte network, as described above. cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $142 million, $246 million and $64 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
debt as of december 31, 2016, our total debt was $27.8 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $27.4 billion was classified as long-term debt. significant debt-related activity during 2016 included:
•   in march 2016, t-mobile usa, a subsidiary of t-mobile us, inc., and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a purchase agreement with deutsche telekom ag ("deutsche telekom"), our majority stockholder, under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom $2.0 billion of 5.300% senior notes due 2021 (the "5.300% senior notes") for an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 billion. as amended in october 2016, if t-mobile usa does not elect to issue the 5.300% senior notes on or prior to may 5, 2017, the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and t-mobile usa must reimburse deutsche telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction. in addition, t-mobile usa is required to reimburse deutsche telekom for its cost of hedging arrangements related to the extension for the duration of the extended commitments.
•   in april 2016, t-mobile usa issued $1.0 billion of public 6.000% senior notes due 2024.
•   in april 2016, t-mobile usa entered into a purchase agreement with deutsche telekom, under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom up to $1.35 billion of 6.000% senior notes due 2024 and (iii) entered into another purchase agreement with deutsche telekom, under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom up to an additional $650 million of 6.000% senior notes due 2024.
•   the purchase price for the 6.000% senior notes that may be issued under the $1.35 billion purchase agreement will be approximately 103.316% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued. as amended in october 2016, if t-mobile usa does not elect to issue the 6.000% senior notes under the $1.35 billion purchase agreement on or prior to may 5, 2017 or elects to issue less than $1.35 billion of 6.000% senior notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and t-mobile usa must reimburse deutsche telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction. in addition, t-mobile usa is required to reimburse deutsche telekom for its cost of hedging arrangements related to the extension for the duration of the extended commitments.
•   in april 2016, t-mobile usa entered into another purchase agreement with deutsche telekom, in which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom up to an additional $650 million of 6.000% senior notes due 2024. the purchase price for the 6.000% senior notes that may be issued under the $650 million purchase agreement will be approximately 104.047% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued. as amended in october 2016, if t-mobile usa does not elect to issue the 6.000% senior notes under the $650 million purchase agreement on or prior to may 5, 2017 or elects to issue less than $650 million senior notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and t-mobile usa must reimburse deutsche telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction. in addition, t-mobile usa is required to reimburse deutsche telekom for its cost of hedging arrangements related to the extension for the duration of the extended commitments.
•   we have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. as of december 31, 2016, we have committed to $1.3 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $799 million was executed during the year ended december 31, 2016. we expect to enter into up to an additional $900 million in capital lease commitments during 2017.
•   in december 2016, we terminated our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom. in addition, t-mobile usa entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom which comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion senior
40
secured revolving credit agreement. as of december 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
•   in january 2017, t-mobile usa borrowed $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility ("incremental term loan facility") with deutsche telekom to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding secured term loans under its term loan credit agreement dated november 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction intended to be used to redeem callable high yield debt. the loans under the incremental term loan facility were drawn in two tranches on january 31, 2017 (i) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.00% and will mature on november 9, 2022 and (ii) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.25% and will mature on january 31, 2024. the incremental term loan facility increases deutsche telekom's incremental term loan commitment provided to t-mobile usa under that certain first incremental facility amendment dated as of december 29, 2016 from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provides to t-mobile usa an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment. see note 14 - subsequent events of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
we could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2017, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future fcc spectrum license auctions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months. our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures and redemption of high yield callable debt.
we determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. we regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.
the indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the issuer to loan funds or make payments to the parent. however, the issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of december 31, 2016.
capital expenditures our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build out of 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses. we expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion in 2017, excluding capitalized interest. this does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or purchases of spectrum licenses. similar to 2016, cash capital expenditures will be front-end loaded in 2017 due to the completion of the 700 mhz a-block build-out.
in particular, we are participating in the fcc broadcast incentive auction of low-band 600 mhz spectrum licenses that is currently in-progress. if we win spectrum in the auction, we may incur substantial additional expenditures for the purchase price and to gain access to such spectrum. any such amounts would be funded primarily through cash on hand and borrowings. as a result, our level of debt could increase.

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of december 31, 2016 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:
(in millions)                                        less than 1 year           1 - 3 years           4 - 5 years           more than 5 years               total long-term debt (1)                                        $20                  $3,040                $7,790                   $15,330                 $26,180

(1)   represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements. see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(2)   future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the tower obligations. see note 8 - tower obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(3)   as of december 31, 2016, we have updated the future minimum lease payments for all cell site leases presented above to include only payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only as they represent the payments which we cannot avoid at our option and also corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases. this update had the effect of reducing our operating lease commitments included in the table above by $4.6 billion as of december 31, 2016. see note 12 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(4)   t-mobile calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the contract. termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due in less than one year, as this is the earliest t-mobile could exit these contracts. for certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. this table does not include open purchase orders as of december 31, 2016 under normal business purposes. see note 12 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(5)   represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant cell sites as of december 31, 2016.
certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. in addition, because dividends on preferred stock are subject to approval by our board of directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred and the dividend has not been paid. see note 13 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
the purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. these amounts do not represent t-mobile's entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which t-mobile is contractually committed. where t-mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, t-mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
off-balance sheet arrangements in 2015, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain eip accounts receivable on a revolving basis through november 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. in june 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $1.3 billion with a scheduled expiration date in november 2017. in 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis through march 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. in november 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million with a scheduled expiration date in march 2018. as of december 31, 2016, t-mobile derecognized net receivables of $2.5 billion upon sale through these arrangements.  see note 3 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
42
related-party transactions in march 2016, t-mobile usa entered into a purchase agreement with deutsche telekom under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom $2.0 billion of 5.300% senior notes due 2021 for an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 billion.
in april 2016, t-mobile usa entered into a purchase agreement with deutsche telekom under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom up to $1.35 billion of 6.000% senior notes due 2024. the purchase price for the 6.000% senior notes that may be issued under the $1.35 billion purchase agreement will be approximately 103.316% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.
in april 2016, t-mobile usa entered into a purchase agreement with deutsche telekom under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom up to $650 million of 6.000% senior notes due 2024. the purchase price for the 6.000% senior notes that may be issued under the $650 million purchase agreement will be approximately 104.047% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.
the purchase agreements were amended in october 2016, see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
in december 2016, we terminated our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom. in addition, t-mobile usa entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom which comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. as of december 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
in january 2017, t-mobile usa borrowed $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility ("incremental term loan facility") with deutsche telekom to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding secured term loans under its term loan credit agreement dated november 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction intended to be used to redeem callable high yield debt. the loans under the incremental term loan facility were drawn in two tranches on january 31, 2017 (i) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.00% and will mature on november 9, 2022 and (ii) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.25% and will mature on january 31, 2024. the incremental term loan facility increases deutsche telekom's incremental term loan commitment provided to t-mobile usa under that certain first incremental facility amendment dated as of december 29, 2016 from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provides to t-mobile usa an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment. see note 14 - subsequent events of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
we also have related party transactions associated with deutsche telekom or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing. see note 13 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
disclosure of iranian activities under section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934
section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 added section 13(r) to the exchange act of 1934, as amended ("exchange act").  section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the u.s. by non-u.s. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under u.s. law.
as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates in 2016 that requires disclosure in this report under section 13(r) of the exchange act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with deutsche telekom. we have relied upon deutsche telekom for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.
deutsche telekom, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: gostaresh ertebatat taliya, irancell telecommunications services company ("mtn irancell"), telecommunication kish company, mobile telecommunication company of iran, and telecommunication infrastructure company of iran. in
43
2016, gross revenues of all deutsche telekom affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with iran were less than $1.0 million and estimated net profits were less than $1.0 million.
in addition, deutsche telekom, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective european home countries (in particular germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the embassy of iran in those european countries. gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities in 2016 were less than $0.1 million. we understand that deutsche telekom intends to continue these activities.
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results as they require the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. these estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.
allowances we maintain an allowance for estimated losses inherent in the accounts receivable and eip receivable portfolios. when determining the allowance, we consider a number of factors, including historical experience and current collection trends, aging of the receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions.
credit collection risks are assessed for each type of receivable, such as eip receivables, based upon historical and expected write-offs, net of recoveries, and an analysis of the aged receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the receivable ages. to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the required allowance amounts could differ from the estimate. we write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.
we offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 24 months using an eip. at the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables and record the eip receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. the difference between the present value of the eip receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenues. we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the amount of expected credit losses on the eip receivables. as a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as interest income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross eip receivables exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances.
total imputed discount and allowances as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 8.0% and 8.2%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including eip receivables.
depreciation depreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to t-mobile, which is generally the lease term. depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. these studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and expected loss of leased wireless devices. when these factors indicate that an asset's useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining
44

evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment we assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.
we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two-step test. in the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. in the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. we believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value.
in the second step, we determine the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that currently may not be recorded. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.
we test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is less than its carrying value. if we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. if the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.  we estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. the greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). the value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. we base the assumptions underlying the greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. future cash flows in the greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, ebitda margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.
the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. if actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. the most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, ebitda margins and the long-term growth rate. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.
guarantee liabilities in 2013, we introduced a device trade-in program, just upgrade my phone ("jump!"), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an eip and have a qualifying t-mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. upon qualifying jump! program upgrades, the customers' remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new eip.

for customers who enroll in jump!, we defer and recognize a liability, for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. the guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining eip balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. when customers upgrade their device, the difference between the eip balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. all assumptions are reviewed periodically.
rent expense most of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. we calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception or significant modification, to be reasonably assured. we consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. we make significant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a "penalty." in doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. a valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. we consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.

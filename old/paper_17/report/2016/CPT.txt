item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.
2
risks associated with capital markets, credit markets, and real estate volatility in capital and credit markets, or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, either nationally or regionally in one or more of the markets in which we operate, could adversely impact us.
the capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption. we therefore may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all, which would adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to make distributions to shareholders, acquire assets and continue our development activities. other weakened economic conditions, including job losses, high unemployment levels, stock market volatility, and uncertainty about the future, could adversely affect rental rates and occupancy levels. unfavorable changes in economic conditions may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and operating results.
additional key economic risks which may adversely affect conditions in the markets in which we operate include the following:
•   local conditions, such as an oversupply of apartments or other housing available for rent, or a reduction in demand for apartments in the area;
•   declines in the financial condition of our tenants, which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants;
•   declines in market rental rates;
•   low mortgage interest rates and home pricing, making alternative housing more affordable;
•   government or builder incentives which enable home buyers to put little or no money down, making alternative housing options more attractive;
•   regional economic downturns, including, but not limited to, business layoffs, downsizing and increased unemployment, which may impact one or more of our geographical markets; and
•   increased operating costs, if these costs cannot be passed through to residents.
short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents.
our apartment leases are generally for a term of eighteen months or less. as these leases typically permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.
competition could limit our ability to lease apartments or increase or maintain rental income.
there are numerous housing alternatives which compete with our properties in attracting residents. our properties compete directly with other multifamily properties as well as condominiums and single-family homes which are available for rent or purchase in the markets in which our properties are located. this competitive environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease apartment homes at our present properties or any newly developed or acquired property, as well as on the rents realized.
we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities.
we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings. the risks inherent in purchasing, owning, and developing land increase as demand for apartments, or rental rates, decrease. real estate markets are highly uncertain and, as a result, the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly. in addition, carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability. as a result, we hold certain land, and may in the future acquire additional land, in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude our developing a profitable multifamily community. if there are subsequent changes in the fair market value of our land holdings which we determine is less than the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell, we may be required to take future impairment charges which would reduce our net income.
potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect us.
there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac. through their lender originator networks, fannie mae and freddie mac are significant lenders both to us and to buyers of our properties. fannie mae and freddie mac have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities and any changes to their mandates, further reductions in their size or the scale of their activities, or loss of their key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on us and may, among other things, lead to lower values for our assets and higher interest rates on our
3
borrowings. fannie mae's and freddie mac's regulator has set overall volume limits on most of fannie mae's and freddie mac's lending activities. the regulator in the future could require fannie mae and freddie mac to focus more of their lending activities on small borrowers or properties the regulator deems affordable, which may or may not include our assets, which could also adversely impact us. in addition, the members of the current presidential administration have announced restructuring and privatizing fannie mae and freddie mac is a priority of the current administration, and there is uncertainty regarding the impact of this action on us and buyers of our properties.
risks associated with our operations development, redevelopment and construction risks could impact our profitability.
we intend to continue to develop, redevelop and construct multifamily apartment communities for our portfolio. in 2017, we expect to incur costs between approximately $150 million and $170 million related to the construction of seven consolidated projects. additionally, during 2017, we expect to incur costs between approximately $20 million and $30 million related to the start of new development activities and between approximately $24 million and $28 million related to redevelopment of existing properties. our development, redevelopment and construction activities may be exposed to a number of risks which may increase our construction costs and decrease our profitability, including the following:
•   inability to obtain, or delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required permits and authorizations;
•   increased materials and labor costs, problems with contractors or subcontractors, or other costs including those costs due to errors and omissions which occur in the design or construction process;
•   inability to obtain financing with favorable terms;
•   inability to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule;
•   forecasted occupancy and rental rates may differ from the actual results; and
•   the incurrence of costs related to the abandonment of development opportunities which we have pursued and subsequently deemed unfeasible.
our inability to successfully implement our development, redevelopment and construction strategy could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and pay distributions to shareholders.
one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is engaged in the business of providing general contracting services under construction contracts entered into between it and third parties (which may include our nonconsolidated affiliates). the terms of those construction contracts generally require this subsidiary to estimate the time and costs to complete a project, and to assume the risk when these estimates may be greater than anticipated. as a result, profitability on those contracts is dependent on the ability to accurately predict such factors. the time and costs necessary to complete a project may be affected by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those listed above, many of which are beyond this subsidiary's control. in addition, the terms of those contracts generally require this subsidiary to warrant its work for a period of time during which it may be required to repair, replace, or rebuild non-conforming work. further, trailing liabilities, based on various legal theories such as claims of negligent construction, may result from such projects, and these trailing liabilities may go on for a number of years depending on the length of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdictions.
investments through joint ventures and discretionary funds involve risks not present in investments in which we are the sole investor.
we have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures. these investments involve risks, including, but not limited to, the possibility the other joint venture partner may: have business goals which are inconsistent with ours, possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests, or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture's financial obligations. we and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire a joint venture partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction. each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate, finance, or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement. the risks associated with our discretionary funds, which we manage as the general partner and advisor, include, but are not limited to, the following:
•   one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of the funds and has unlimited liability for the third-party debts, obligations, and liabilities of the funds pursuant to partnership law;
4
•   investors in the funds (other than us), by majority vote, may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the funds with or without cause and the funds' advisory boards, by a majority vote of their members, may remove our subsidiary as the general partner of the funds at any time for cause;
•   while we have broad discretion to manage the funds and make investment decisions on behalf of the funds, the investors or the funds' advisory boards must approve certain matters, and as a result we may be unable to make certain investments or implement certain decisions on behalf of the funds which we consider beneficial;
•   our ability to dispose of all or a portion of our investments in the funds is subject to significant restrictions; and
•   we may be liable if the funds fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters.
competition could adversely affect our ability to acquire properties.
we expect other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private investors, and other multifamily reits, will compete with us to acquire additional operating properties. this competition could increase prices for the type of properties we would likely pursue and adversely affect our ability to acquire these properties or achieve the expected profitability of such properties upon acquisition.
our acquisition strategy may not produce the cash flows expected.
we may acquire additional operating properties on a selective basis. our acquisition activities are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:
•   we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties into our existing operations;
•   our estimates of the costs, if any, of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate;
•   the expected occupancy, rental rates and operating expenses may differ from the actual results;
•   we may not be able to obtain adequate financing; and
•   we may not be able to identify suitable candidates on terms acceptable to us and may not achieve expected returns or other benefits as a result of integration challenges, such as personnel and technology.
failure to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences.
we may not continue to qualify as a reit in the future. also, the internal revenue service may challenge our qualification as a reit for prior years.
for any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify under statutory relief provisions:
•   we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, including any applicable alternative minimum tax;
•   we would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify, thereby reducing our net income, including any distributions to shareholders, as we would be required to pay significant income taxes for the year or years involved; and,
•   our ability to expand our business and raise capital would be impaired, which may adversely affect the value of our common shares.
we may face other tax liabilities in the future which may impact our cash flow. these potential tax liabilities may be calculated on our income or property values at either the corporate or individual property levels. any additional tax expense incurred would decrease the cash available for cash distributions to our common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders. additionally, in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our adjusted taxable income.
tax laws and related interpretations may change at any time, and any such legislative or other actions could have a negative effect on us.
tax laws are under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process, at the internal revenue service and the u.s. department of the treasury, and by various state and local tax authorities. changes to tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could adversely affect us in a number of ways, including the following:
5
•   making it more difficult or more costly for us to qualify as a reit;
•   decreasing real estate values generally; and,
•   lowering effective tax rates for non-reit "c" corporations, which may cause investors to perceive investments in reits to be less attractive than investments in the stock of non-reit "c" corporations.
we cannot predict whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations, and administrative interpretations applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed.  any such change may significantly affect our liquidity and results of operations, as well as the value of our shares.
litigation risks could affect our business.
as a publicly-traded owner, developer and manager of multifamily properties, we may incur liability based on various conditions at our properties and the buildings thereon, and we also have become and in the future may become involved in legal proceedings, including consumer, employment, tort or commercial litigation, which if decided adversely to or settled by us, and not adequately covered by insurance, could result in liability which is material to our financial condition or results of operations.
damage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses.
certain of our properties are located in areas that may experience catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including fires, snow or ice storms, windstorms, tornadoes or hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding or other severe weather. these adverse weather or natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed our insurance coverage. in the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future revenue from that property. we could also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations.
a cybersecurity incident and other technology disruptions could negatively impact our business.
we use technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations. we also use mobile devices, social networking, outside vendors and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers and residents. such uses give rise to potential cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and confidential information and intellectual property, including residents' and suppliers' personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about us. further, as we pursue our strategy to grow through acquisitions and developments and to pursue new initiatives to improve our operations, we are also expanding our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. if we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with our operations, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. additionally, the measures we have implemented to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents may not be effective. the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive data, confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of residents, potential liability and competitive disadvantage, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
our third-party service providers are primarily responsible for the security of their own information technology environments and in certain instances, we rely significantly on third-party service providers to supply and store our sensitive data in a secure manner. all of these third parties face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore adversely impact us. while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases, we do not directly control any of such parties' information technology security operations, or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cybersecurity threats. accordingly, we are subject to any flaws in or breaches to their information technology systems or those which they operate for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
risks associated with our indebtedness and financing we have significant debt, which could have adverse consequences.
as of december 31, 2016, we had outstanding debt of approximately $2.5 billion. this indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including, but not limited to:
6
•   if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness, and if we are unable to meet our mortgage obligations, we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the mortgaged property;
•   our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions is increased; and
•   our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in business and industry conditions is limited.
the mortgages on our properties subject to secured debt, our unsecured credit facilities, and the indenture under which our unsecured debt was issued, contain customary restrictions, requirements, and other limitations, as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios. maintaining compliance with these provisions could limit our financial flexibility. a default in these provisions, if uncured, could require us to repay the indebtedness before the scheduled maturity date, which could adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs.
insufficient cash flows could limit our ability to make required payments for debt obligations or pay distributions to shareholders.
substantially all of our income is derived from rental and other income from our multifamily communities. as a result, our performance depends in large part on our ability to collect rent from residents, which could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
•   delay in resident lease commencements;
•   decline in occupancy;
•   failure of residents to make rental payments when due;
•   the attractiveness of our properties to residents and potential residents;
•   our ability to adequately manage and maintain our communities;
•   competition from other available apartments and housing alternatives;
•   changes in market rents; and
•   increases in operating expenses.
cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest with respect to debt financing. in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our adjusted taxable income. this requirement limits the cash available to meet required principal payments on our debt.
issuances of additional debt may adversely impact our financial condition.
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including the rental and occupancy rates of our multifamily properties, minimum dividend requirements to our equity holders, development, redevelopment and other capital expenditures, costs of operations, and potential acquisitions. if our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing earlier than anticipated. if we issue more debt, we could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in our debt service requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future.
we may be unable to renew, repay, or refinance our outstanding debt.
we are subject to the risk that indebtedness on our properties or our unsecured indebtedness will not be renewed, repaid, or refinanced when due or the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness. if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms, which might result in losses to us. such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt. furthermore, if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose on the property, appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases, or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value. foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds, thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the code.
7
rising interest rates could both increase our borrowing costs, thereby adversely affecting our cash flows and the amounts available for distribution to our shareholders, and decrease our share price, if investors seek higher yields through other investments.
we have mortgage debt with varying interest rates dependent upon various market indexes. in addition, we have an unsecured credit facility bearing interest at variable rates on all amounts drawn. we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense, unless we make arrangements which hedge the risk of rising interest rates, and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt. accordingly, higher interest rates would adversely affect cash flow, net income, and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to shareholders.
an environment of rising interest rates could also lead holders of our securities to seek higher yields through other investments, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares. one of the factors which may influence the price of our stock in public markets is the annual distribution rate we pay as compared with the yields on alternative investments.
failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets.
moody's, fitch, and standard & poor's, the major debt rating agencies, routinely evaluate our debt and have given us ratings of a3 with stable outlook, a- with stable outlook, and bbb+ with stable outlook, respectively, on our senior unsecured debt. these ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. due to changes in market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets.
risks associated with our shares share ownership limits and our ability to issue additional equity securities may prevent takeovers beneficial to shareholders.
for us to maintain our qualification as a reit, we must have 100 or more shareholders during the year and not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals. as defined for federal income tax purposes, the term "individuals" includes a number of specified entities. to minimize the possibility of us failing to qualify as a reit under this test, our declaration of trust includes restrictions on transfers of our shares and ownership limits. the ownership limits, as well as our ability to issue other classes of equity securities, may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control. these provisions may also deter tender offers for our common shares which may be attractive to you or limit your opportunity to receive a premium for your shares which might otherwise exist if a third party were attempting to effect a change in control transaction.
our share price will fluctuate.
the market price and trading volume of our common shares are subject to fluctuation due to general market conditions, the risks discussed in this report and other matters, including, but not limited to, the following:
•   operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;
•   investor interest in our property portfolio;
•   the reputation and performance of reits;
•   the attractiveness of reits as compared to other investment vehicles;
•   the results of our financial condition and operations;
•   the perception of our growth and earnings potential;
•   minimum dividend requirements;
•   increases in market interest rates, which may lead purchasers of our common shares to demand a higher yield; and
•   changes in financial markets and national and regional economic and general market conditions.
the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations.
the form, timing and amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of our board of trust managers and will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution
8
requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of trust managers may consider relevant. the board of trust managers may modify the form, timing and amount of dividends from time to time.

these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions as of the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements because of subsequent events.
executive summary we are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, development, redevelopment, acquisition, and construction of multifamily apartment communities. overall, we focus on investing in markets characterized by high-growth economic conditions, strong employment, and attractive quality of life which we believe leads to higher demand and retention of our apartments. as of december 31, 2016, we owned interests in, operated, or were developing 159 multifamily properties comprised of 55,366 apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table. in addition, we own other land holdings which we may develop into multifamily apartment communities in the future.
property operations our results for the year ended december 31, 2016 reflect an increase in same store revenues of 3.9% as compared to 2015. this increase was due to higher average rental rates and increased other property income, which we believe were due to, among other matters, the continuation of improving economic conditions, including job growth, favorable demographics, a manageable supply of new multifamily housing, and in part to more individuals choosing to rent versus buy as evidenced by the moderating level of homeownership rates, all of which have resulted in higher rental rates. we believe u.s. economic and employment growth is likely to continue during 2017 and the supply of new multifamily homes, although increasing, will likely remain at manageable levels. if economic conditions were to worsen, our operating results could be adversely affected.
construction activity at december 31, 2016, we had seven projects under construction to be comprised of 2,573 apartment homes, with stabilization expected to be completed within the next 42 months. as of december 31, 2016, we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven projects to be approximately $240.6 million.
acquisitions during the year ended december 31, 2016, we acquired an aggregate of approximately of 4.6 acres of land located in denver, colorado and charlotte, north carolina for approximately $19.9 million. all of the land parcels acquired in 2016 are currently in development as of december 31, 2016.
dispositions operating properties: during the year ended december 31, 2016, we sold one dual-phased property and six other operating properties comprised of an aggregate of 3,184 apartment homes with an average age of 24 years, located in landover and frederick, maryland; fullerton, california; and tampa, altamonte springs, and st. petersburg, florida for an aggregate of approximately $523.4 million, and recognized a gain of approximately $294.9 million.
land: during 2016, we also sold approximately 6.3 acres of land adjacent to an operating property in tampa, florida for approximately $2.2 million and recognized a gain of approximately $0.4 million.
discontinued operations: in april 2016, we sold 15 operating properties, comprised of an aggregate of 4,918 apartment homes with an average age of 23 years, a retail center and approximately 19.6 acres of land, all located in las vegas, nevada, to an unaffiliated third party for an aggregate of approximately $630.0 million and recognized a gain of approximately $375.2 million.
future outlook subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to seek opportunities to develop, redevelop and acquire existing communities. we also intend to evaluate our operating property and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise. we further intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. we anticipate meeting our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from property dispositions, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, equity issued from our atm program, other unsecured borrowings, and secured mortgages.
21
as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $237.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $100.0 million in short-term investments, and no balance outstanding on our $600 million unsecured credit facility. as of the date of this filing, we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $315.3 million remaining available for sale under our atm program. we believe payments of debt in 2017 are manageable at approximately $276.0 million which represents approximately 11.1% of our total outstanding debt, and includes scheduled principal amortization of approximately $1.2 million. we believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover near-term debt maturities and new development, redevelopment, and other capital funding requirements. we will, however, continue to assess and take further actions we believe are prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements.

results of operations changes in revenues and expenses related to our operating properties from period to period are due primarily to the performance of stabilized properties in the portfolio, the lease-up of newly constructed properties, acquisitions, and dispositions. where appropriate, comparisons of income and expense for communities included in continuing operations are made on a dollars-per-weighted average apartment home basis in order to adjust for such changes in the number of apartment homes owned during each period. selected weighted averages for the years ended december 31 are as follows:

management considers property net operating income ("noi") to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance to net income because it reflects the operating performance of our communities without an allocation of corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs. we define noi as total property income less property operating and maintenance expenses less real estate taxes. noi is further detailed in the property-level noi table as seen below. noi is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap") and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance, should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or an indication of cash available to fund cash needs. additionally, noi as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation.

same store analysis same store property noi increased approximately $22.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. this increase was due to an increase of approximately $27.9 million in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016, partially offset by an increase of approximately $5.8 million in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.
the $27.9 million increase in same store property revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, was due in part to an increase in same store rental revenues of approximately $17.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, which was primarily due to a 3.2% increase in average rental rates for our same store portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. the increase in same store property revenue was also due to an increase of approximately $10.5 million in other property revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to increases in income from our bulk internet rebilling program and miscellaneous fee income.
28
the $5.8 million increase in same store property expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to increased costs associated with our bulk internet rebilling program and a $2.5 million, or 2.8%, increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations at a number of our communities. these increases were partially offset by decreased property insurance expenses during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
same store property noi increased approximately $23.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. this increase was due to an increase of approximately $36.4 million in same store property revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015, partially offset by an increase of approximately $13.1 million in same store property expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014.
the $36.4 million increase in same store property revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, was due in part to an increase in same store rental revenues of approximately $26.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, which was primarily due to a 4.1% increase in average rental rates for our same store portfolio during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. the increase in same store property revenue was also due to an increase of approximately $9.9 million in other property revenue during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to increases in income from our bulk internet rebilling program and miscellaneous fee income.
the $13.1 million increase in same store property expense during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to a $5.8 million, or 6.6%, increase in real estate taxes as a result of higher property valuations at a number of our communities as well as increased costs associated with our bulk internet rebilling program.
non-same store and development and lease-up analysis property noi from non-same store and development and lease-up communities increased approximately $21.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. the increase was due to an increase of approximately $33.3 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016, partially offset by an increase of approximately $12.1 million in expenses for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. the increases in property revenues and expenses from our non-same store communities were primarily due to the stabilization of five operating properties in 2015 and four operating properties in 2016. the increases in property revenues and expenses from our development and lease-up communities were primarily due to the completion and partial lease up of three properties during 2015 and two properties during 2016, and the partial lease-up of two properties which were under construction at december 31, 2016.
property noi from non-same store and development and lease-up communities increased approximately $25.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. the increase was due to an increase of approximately $42.3 million in revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015, partially offset by an increase of approximately $16.7 million in expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. the increases in property revenues and expenses from our non-same store communities were primarily due to the stabilization of one operating property in 2014 and five operating properties in 2015, and the acquisition of one operating property in 2014. the increases in property revenues and expenses from our development and lease-up communities were primarily due to the completion and partial lease up of three properties in 2015 and the partial lease-up of one property which was under construction at december 31, 2015.
dispositions/other property analysis dispositions/other property noi decreased approximately $12.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. the decrease was primarily due to the disposition of three operating properties in 2015, and the disposition of one dual-phase operating property and six other operating properties in 2016.

fee and asset management income, which represents income related to property management of our joint ventures and fees from third-party construction projects, decreased approximately $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and decreased approximately $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. the slight decrease for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in development and construction fees earned due to the timing of the commencement and completion of the development of one community by one of our funds in 2015, partially offset by higher third-party construction activity. the decrease for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower development and construction fees earned due to the timing of development communities started and completed by our funds during 2014 and 2015, and our increase in ownership interest in two of the funds from 20% to 31.3% effective december 23, 2014. we eliminate fee income provided by our funds to the extent of our ownership.
interest and other income increased approximately $1.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, and was relatively flat for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase for 2016 was due to higher interest income earned on investments in cash and short-term investments due to an increase in average cash balances and an increase in interest income earned due to higher average note receivable balances outstanding on our real estate secured loans to unaffiliated third parties in 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.
our deferred compensation plans recognized income of approximately $5.5 million in 2016, a loss of approximately $0.3 million in 2015 and income of approximately $3.9 million in 2014. these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the expense (benefit) related to these plans, as discussed below.

property management expense, which primarily represents regional supervision and accounting costs related to property operations, increased approximately $2.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased approximately $1.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. these increases were primarily due to increases in salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation expenses. property management expenses were 2.9% of total property revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 and were 2.8% of total property revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
fee and asset management expense, which represents expenses related to property management of our joint ventures and fees from third-party construction projects, decreased approximately $0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and decreased approximately $0.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. the decrease for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower professional fees incurred in managing our joint ventures
30
and lower expenses incurred as a result of decreases in development and construction activity relating to the timing of one development community started and completed by one of the funds in 2015. the decrease was partially offset by higher expenses relating to an increase in third-party construction activity in 2016 as compared to 2015. the decrease for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower expenses directly related to lower net revenues resulting from our change in ownership interest in two of the funds effective december 23, 2014.
general and administrative expenses increased approximately $1.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and decreased approximately $4.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. general and administrative expenses were 5.4%, 5.5% and 6.4% of total revenues, excluding income (loss) on deferred compensation plans, for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation expenses due to higher deferred compensation amortization costs resulting from the accelerated vesting relating to certain trust managers and executive officers meeting the retirement eligibility and service requirements as defined in the 2011 share incentive plan of camden property trust, and an increase in the value of awards granted in 2016 as compared to the value of awards which vested during the same period in 2015.
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to approximately $10.0 million in one-time bonuses paid to employees in 2014 relating to the restructuring of the funds in december 2014. excluding the $10.0 million one-time bonus paid in 2014, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $5.2 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, which was primarily related to an increase in salaries, benefits and incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by a slight decrease in professional fees.
interest expense decreased approximately $4.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased approximately $2.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. the decrease in interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the repayment of a $250.0 million, 5.08% senior unsecured note payable in june 2015. the decrease was partially offset by lower capitalized interest during the year ended december 31, 2016, resulting from lower average balances in our development pipeline, and higher interest expense recognized on our variable rate debt due to higher weighted average interest rates in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.
the increase in interest expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased interest expense from the issuance of a $250.0 million, 3.68% senior unsecured note payable in september 2014, and lower capitalized interest of approximately $2.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015, resulting from lower average balances in our development pipeline. the increase in 2015 was also due to an increase in interest expense relating to borrowings on our unsecured credit facility and unsecured short-term borrowing facility as compared to the same period in 2014. the increase in 2015 was partially offset by the repayment of a $250.0 million, 5.08% senior unsecured note payable in june 2015 and the repayment of two secured notes payable in april and september of 2014.
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $9.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased approximately $18.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the completion of units in our development pipeline, the completion of repositions, and increases in capital improvements placed in service during 2016 and 2015. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the disposition of one operating property during the fourth quarter of 2015, and the dispositions of one dual-phased operating property and six other operating properties in 2016.
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the completion of units in our development pipeline, the completion of repositions, increases in capital improvements placed in service during 2014 and 2015, and the acquisition of one operating property in october 2014. the increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the dispositions of five operating properties in 2014 and three operating properties in 2015.
our deferred compensation plans incurred an expense of approximately $5.5 million in 2016, a benefit of approximately $0.3 million in 2015 and an expense of $3.9 million in 2014. these changes were related to the performance of the investments held in deferred compensation plans for participants and were directly offset by the income (loss) related to these plans, as discussed in the non-property income section above.

during the year ended december 31, 2016 we recognized an approximate $294.9 million gain related to the sale of one dual-phased property and six other operating properties. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized an approximate $104.0 million gain related to the sale of three operating properties. for the year ended 2016, we also sold 6.3 acres of land adjacent to an operating property in tampa, florida for a gain of approximately $0.4 million and for the year ended 2015, we sold two land holdings adjacent to operating properties in dallas and houston, texas for a gain of approximately $0.3 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recognized an approximate $155.7 million gain related to the sales of five operating properties and the sale of approximately 29.3 acres located adjacent to current operating and development communities for a gain on the sale of land of approximately $3.6 million. the $1.2 million impairment associated with land holdings in 2014 reflects the difference between the land holding's carrying value and the sales price.
equity in income of joint ventures increased approximately $1.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, and decreased approximately $0.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. the increase in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in earnings resulting from higher rental and other property revenues from the operating properties owned by the funds and the stabilization of one operating property owned by one of the funds during the first quarter of 2016. the increase was partially offset by higher real estate taxes as a result of increased property valuations at a number of the communities owned by the funds. the increase was further offset by an increase in interest expense incurred during the year ended december 31, 2016 resulting from interest capitalized during the year ended december 31, 2015 while a property was under construction.
the decrease in equity in income of joint ventures in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the recognition of a $3.6 million proportionate share of the gain relating to the sale of two operating properties by the funds in 2014. the decrease was partially offset by an increase in earnings resulting from our increase in ownership interest in two of the funds from 20% to 31.3% effective december 23, 2014. the decrease was further offset by an increase in earnings resulting from higher rental income from the stabilized operating properties owned by the funds and two operating properties owned by the funds reaching stabilization during the third quarter of 2014.
funds from operations ("ffo") and adjusted ffo ("affo")
management considers ffo and affo to be appropriate measures of the financial performance of an equity reit. the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") currently defines ffo as net income (computed in accordance with gaap), excluding gains (or losses) associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties, real estate depreciation and amortization, impairments of depreciable assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis. our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, including certain non-controlling interests, which are convertible into common shares. we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation, ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company's real estate investments between periods or to different companies.
affo is calculated utilizing ffo less recurring capitalized expenditures which are necessary to help preserve the value of and maintain the functionality at our communities. we also consider affo to be a useful supplemental measure because it is frequently used by analysts and investors to evaluate a reit's operating performance between periods or different companies. our definition of recurring capital expenditures may differ from other reits, and there can be no assurance our basis for computing this measure is comparable to other reits.
to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, we believe ffo and affo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report. ffo and affo are not defined by gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance. additionally, ffo and affo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation.

liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility, which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available. we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by:
•   extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable;
•   managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt;
•   maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios; and,
•   using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and equity.
our interest expense coverage ratio, net of capitalized interest, was approximately 5.5, 5.2, and 5.0 times for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense and is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses, non-property income, other expenses and income from discontinued operations after adding back depreciation, amortization, and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations. approximately 78.3%, 79.9%, and 79.5% of our properties were unencumbered at december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. our weighted average maturity of debt was approximately 4.9 years at december 31, 2016.
we also intend to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by continuing to focus on our core fundamentals, which currently are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs.
our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand, short-term investments, and cash flow generated from operations. other sources may include one or more of the following: availability under our unsecured credit facility,
33
proceeds from property dispositions, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, equity issued from our atm program, and other unsecured borrowings and secured mortgages. we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2017 including:
•   normal recurring operating expenses;
•   current debt service requirements, including debt maturities;
•   recurring capital expenditures;
•   reposition expenditures;
•   funding of property developments, redevelopments, acquisitions, and joint venture investments; and,
•   the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code.
factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets, and interest rates, changes in sources of financing, the satisfaction of reit dividend requirements, our ability to complete asset purchases, sales, or developments, the effect our debt level and changes in credit ratings could have on our cost of funds, and our ability to access capital markets.
cash flows the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015.
net cash from operating activities was approximately $443.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $423.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to higher net property-level noi, primarily due to the growth in revenues attributable to increased rental rates from our same store communities and growth in the number of non-same store properties resulting from the stabilization of nine operating properties in 2015 and 2016, the completion and partial lease-up of two operating properties in 2016, and the partial lease-up of two properties under construction at december 31, 2016. the increase was also due to an approximate $10.0 million bonus paid to employees in 2015 relating to the restructuring of the funds in december 2014. the increase was partially offset by a decrease related to the disposition of 15 operating properties, a retail center, and approximately 19.6 acres of land classified as discontinued operations in 2016, as well as the disposition of three other operating properties, in 2015 and the disposition of one dual-phased operating property and six other operating properties in 2016. see further discussions of our 2016 operations as compared to 2015 in "results of operations."
net cash from investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 totaled approximately $690.4 million as compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately $293.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015. during 2016, we received approximately $623.0 million, net of expenses, from the sale of 15 operating properties, a retail center, and approximately 19.6 acres of land classified as discontinued operations, as well as approximately $515.8 million, net of expenses, from the sale of one dual-phased operating property and six other properties and one land holding. these cash inflows were partially offset by cash outflows for property development and capital improvements of approximately $343.0 million during 2016 as compared to approximately $411.8 million in 2015, primarily due to the completion of nine operating properties in 2015 and 2016, and the completion of repositions at several of our operating properties. the expenditures related to property development and capital improvements during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 included the following:

during the year ended december 31, 2016, cash outflows also included the purchase of a short-term investment for $100 million. during the year ended december 31, 2015, cash outflows also included $13.8 million relating to capital improvements and reposition expenditures from our discontinued operations. these cash outflows were offset by proceeds of approximately $145.0 million from the sale of three operating properties and two land holdings.
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $904.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $273.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015. during 2016, we had net payments of
34
$244.0 million on our unsecured credit facility and other short-term borrowings. we also used approximately $663.4 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders which included the $4.25 per common share special dividend payment made on september 30, 2016. during 2015, we used $250.0 million to repay maturing unsecured notes payable and approximately $3.0 million to pay principal amortization payments. we also used approximately $253.1 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, and approximately $9.5 million to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests in two consolidated joint ventures. the cash flows for 2015 were partially offset by net proceeds from our unsecured line of credit and other short-term borrowings of $244.0 million.
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.
net cash from operating activities was approximately $423.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $418.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was primarily due to higher net property-level net operating income, primarily due to the growth in revenues directly attributable to increased rental rates from our same store communities and growth in non-same store properties primarily relating to the acquisition of one operating property in 2014, the stabilization of one operating property in 2014 and five operating properties in 2015, the completion and partial lease-up of three operating properties during the third and fourth quarters of 2015, and the partial lease-up of one property under construction at december 31, 2015. these increases in net cash from operating activities were partially offset by the disposition of five operating properties in 2014 and three operating properties in 2015. these decreases were also due to an approximate $10.0 million bonus paid to employees in 2015 relating to the restructuring of the funds in december 2014, as well as the timing of the first interest payment relating to the $250 million, 3.68% unsecured notes issued in september 2014, which was made in the first quarter of 2015. see further discussions of our 2015 operations as compared to 2014 in "results of operations."
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2015 totaled approximately $293.2 million as compared to approximately $326.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2014. cash outflows for property development and capital improvements from continuing operations were approximately $411.8 million during 2015 as compared to approximately $497.1 million during 2014, primarily due to the completion of nine operating properties in 2014 and 2015, and the completion of repositions at several of our operating properties. the expenditures related to property development and capital improvements during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 included the following:

during the year ended december 31, 2015, cash outflows also included approximately $13.8 million relating to capital improvements and reposition expenditures from our discontinued operations. these cash outflows were offset by proceeds, net of expenses, of approximately $145.0 million from the sale of three operating properties and two land holdings. additional cash outflows for the year ended december 31, 2014 related to the acquisition of one operating property for approximately $62.3 million and capital improvements from our discontinued operations of approximately $6.2 million. net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2014 was partially offset by cash inflows of approximately $237.6 million, net of expenses, from the sale of five operating properties and four land holdings in 2014, and the distributions received from our joint ventures of approximately $6.4 million relating to the sale of two operating properties in february 2014.
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $273.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $43.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014. during 2015, we used $250.0 million to repay maturing unsecured notes payable and approximately $3.0 million to pay principal amortization payments. we also used approximately $253.1 million to pay distributions to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, and approximately $9.5 million to acquire the remaining non-controlling interests in two fully consolidated joint ventures. the cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2015 were partially offset by net proceeds from our unsecured line of credit and other short-term borrowings of approximately $244.0 million. during 2014, we received net proceeds of approximately $248.1 million from the issuance in september 2014 of $250.0 million unsecured notes payable and net proceeds of approximately $66.2 million from the issuance of approximately 0.9 million common shares from our atm program. the cash inflows during 2014 were partially offset by approximately $236.5 million used for distributions paid to common shareholders and non-controlling interest holders, approximately $32.3 million used to repay maturing secured mortgage notes payable, and approximately $4.0 million used for principal amortization payments.

financial flexibility we have a $600.0 million unsecured credit facility which matures in august 2019, with two six-month options to extend the maturity date at our election to august 2020. additionally, we have the option to further increase our credit facility to $900.0 million by either adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of the existing banks to increase their commitments. the interest rate on this credit facility is based upon the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a margin which is subject to change as our credit ratings change. advances under this credit facility may be priced at the scheduled rates, or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates. these bid rate loans have terms of 180 days or less and may not exceed the lesser of $300.0 million or the remaining amount available under the credit facility. our credit facility is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations. we believe we are in compliance with all such financial covenants and limitations on the date of this filing.
our credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $50.0 million in letters of credit. while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, it does reduce the amount available. at december 31, 2016, we had no balances outstanding on our $600.0 million credit facility and we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $12.7 million, leaving approximately $587.3 million available under our credit facility.
we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement which allows us to offer, from time to time, common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, or warrants. our amended and restated declaration of trust provides we may issue up to 185 million shares of beneficial interest, consisting of 175 million common shares and 10 million preferred shares. at december 31, 2016 we had approximately 87.5 million common shares outstanding, net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements, and no preferred shares outstanding.
in november 2014, we created an at-the-market share offering program (the "atm program") through which we can, but have no obligation to, sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $331.3 million in amounts and at times as we determine, into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common shares, and determinations by management of the appropriate sources of funding for us. we intend to use the net proceeds from any future sales under the atm program for general corporate purposes, which may include reducing future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, the repayment of other indebtedness, the redemption or other repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities, funding for development, redevelopment and investment projects and financing for acquisitions. as of the date of this filing, we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $315.3 million remaining available for sale under the atm program.
we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody's, fitch, and standard and poor's, which are currently a3 with stable outlook, a- with stable outlook, and bbb+ with stable outlook, respectively. we believe our ability to access capital markets is also enhanced by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks, fannie mae, freddie mac, or life insurance companies. however, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future.
future cash requirements and contractual obligations one of our principal long-term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt, including any future borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. we believe payments of debt in 2017 are manageable at approximately $276.0 million which represents approximately 11.1% of our total outstanding debt, and includes scheduled principal amortization of approximately $1.2 million. see note 9, "notes payable," in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities.
we estimate the additional cost to complete the construction of the seven consolidated projects to be approximately $240.6 million. of this amount, we expect to incur costs between approximately $150 million and $170 million during 2017 and to incur the remaining costs during 2018 and 2019. additionally, we expect to incur costs between approximately $20 million and $30 million related to the start of new development activities, between approximately $24 million and $28 million of additional redevelopment expenditures and between approximately $60 million and $64 million of additional recurring capital expenditures during 2017.
we anticipate meeting our near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of one or more of the following: cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows generated from operations, draws on our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from property dispositions, the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement, equity issued from our atm program, other unsecured borrowings, and secured mortgages. we continue to evaluate our operating properties and land development portfolio and plan to continue our practice of selective dispositions as market conditions warrant and opportunities arise.

as a reit, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute current dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of 90% of our annual taxable income. in order to minimize paying income taxes, our general policy is to distribute at least 100% of our taxable income. in september 2016, our board of trust managers also declared a special dividend of $4.25 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of september 23, 2016, which was paid on september 30, 2016. the special dividend consisted of gains on dispositions of assets completed in 2016 and enabled us to distribute 100% of our taxable income; we also paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units. in december 2016, we announced our board of trust managers had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per common share to our common shareholders of record as of december 16, 2016. this dividend was subsequently paid on january 17, 2017 and we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units. excluding the special dividend and aggregated with previous 2016 dividends, this distribution to common shareholders and holders of the common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of $3.00 per share or unit for the year ended december 31, 2016.
in the first quarter of 2017, the company's board of trust managers maintained the $0.75 quarterly dividend rate per common share. future dividend payments are paid at the discretion of the board of trust managers and depend on cash flows generated from operations, the company's financial condition and capital requirements, distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, and other factors which may be deemed relevant by our board of trust managers. assuming similar dividend distributions for the remainder of 2017, our annualized dividend rate for 2017 would be $3.00.
the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december 31, 2016:

(1)   includes scheduled principal payments and amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs.
(2)   subsequent to december 31, 2016, we gave notice of advance repayment on our tax-exempt secured note payable of approximately $30.7 million in february 2017, which was initially due to mature in 2028. this table reflects this repayment in 2017.
(3)   includes contractual interest payments for our senior unsecured notes and secured notes. the interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december 31, 2016.
off-balance sheet arrangements the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured, third-party debt. at december 31, 2016, our unconsolidated joint ventures had outstanding debt of approximately $518.7 million, of which our proportionate share was approximately $162.4 million. as of december 31, 2016, we had no outstanding guarantees related to the loans of our unconsolidated joint ventures.
inflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to eighteen months. in an inflationary environment, we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases. we believe the short-term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
principles of consolidation. we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. investments acquired or created are evaluated based on the
37
accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities ("vies"), which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary. if the investment is determined not to be a vie, then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model. in determining if we have a controlling financial interest, we consider factors such as ownership interests, authority to make decisions, kick-out rights and participating rights. we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event (as defined by gaap) with respect to our investments occurs. the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment.
asset impairment. long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. impairment may exist if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets. we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows, trends, strategic decisions regarding future development plans, and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist. while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding a number of factors, including market rents, economic conditions, and occupancies, could significantly affect these estimates. in estimating fair value, management uses appraisals, management estimates, and discounted cash flow calculations which utilize inputs from a marketplace participant's perspective. when impairment exists, the long-lived asset is adjusted to its fair value. in addition, we evaluate our equity investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment below our carrying value, we will record an impairment charge.
the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions, including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities. we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses. due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses, it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated.
we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets, properties under development, and land is currently recoverable. however, if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value estimates, we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets. any such material non-cash charges could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
cost capitalization. real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges. carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development. capitalized interest is generally based on the weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt. expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements. indirect development costs, including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties, are also capitalized. we begin capitalizing development, construction, and carrying costs when the development of the future real estate asset is probable and activities necessary to prepare the underlying real estate for its intended use have been initiated. all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed. upon substantial completion of the apartment homes, the total capitalized development cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land, respectively. included in capitalized costs are indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities. the estimates used by management require judgment, and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.

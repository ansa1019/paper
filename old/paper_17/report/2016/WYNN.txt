item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, regarding matters that could have an adverse effect, including a material one, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risks related to our business the loss of stephen a. wynn could significantly harm our business.
our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts, skills and reputation of stephen a. wynn, the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and one of the principal stockholders of wynn resorts. mr. wynn's employment agreement expires in october 2022; however, we cannot assure you that mr. wynn will remain with wynn resorts. if we lose the services of mr. wynn, or if he is unable to devote sufficient attention to our operations for any other reason, our business may be significantly impaired.
our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer and corporate spending as a result of global economic conditions.
consumer demand for casino/hotel resorts, trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities that we offer is particularly sensitive to changes in the global economy, which adversely impact discretionary spending on leisure activities. changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general global economic conditions, high unemployment, weakness in housing or oil markets, perceived or actual changes in disposable consumer income and wealth, an economic recession and changes in consumer confidence in the global economy, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism have in the past and could in the future reduce customer demand for the luxury amenities and leisure activities we offer, and may have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
also, consumer demographics and preferences may evolve over time, which, for example, has resulted in growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and react to those trends and any failure to do so may negatively impact our operating results.
visitation to macau may decline due to economic disruptions in mainland china, restrictions on visitations to macau from citizens of mainland china and the anti-corruption campaign.
a significant number of our gaming customers at our macau operations come from mainland china. continued economic disruption, contraction and uncertainty in china could further impact the number of patrons visiting our macau operations or the amount they may be willing to spend. in addition, policies adopted from time to time by the chinese government, including any travel restrictions imposed by china on its citizens such as restrictions imposed on exit visas granted to residents of mainland china for travel to macau, could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland china to our property. it is not known when, or if, policies similar to those implemented in 2009 restricting visitation by mainland chinese citizens to macau and
16
hong kong, will be put in place and travel policies may be adjusted, without notice, in the future. furthermore, the chinese government's ongoing anti-corruption campaign has influenced the behavior of chinese consumers and their spending patterns both domestically and abroad. the campaign has specifically led to tighter monetary transfer regulations, including real time monitoring of certain financial channels, certain types of guidelines on cash withdrawals, which has disrupted, and may impact, the number of visitors and the amount of money they bring from mainland china to macau.  the overall effect of the campaign and monetary transfer restrictions may impact visitation and may continue to negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.
our business is particularly sensitive to the willingness of our customers to travel. acts or the threat of acts of terrorism, regional political events and developments in certain countries could cause severe disruptions in air travel that reduce the number of visitors to our facilities, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel. only a small amount of our business is and will be generated by local residents. most of our customers travel to reach our las vegas and macau properties. acts of terrorism or concerns over the possibility of such acts may severely disrupt domestic and international travel, which would result in a decrease in customer visits to las vegas and macau, including our properties. regional conflicts could have a similar effect on domestic and international travel. disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war or worldwide infectious disease outbreak would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
we are entirely dependent on a limited number of resorts for all of our cash flow, which subjects us to greater risks than a gaming company with more operating properties.
we are currently entirely dependent upon our macau operations and las vegas operations for all of our operating cash flow. as a result, we are subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company with more operating properties or greater geographic diversification. the risks to which we have a greater degree of exposure include the following:
•   changes in local economic and competitive conditions;
•   changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;
•   natural and other disasters, including the outbreak of infectious diseases;
•   an increase in the cost of maintaining our properties;
•   a decline in the number of visitors to las vegas or macau; and
•   a decrease in gaming and non-casino activities at our resorts.
any of the factors outlined above could negatively affect our results of operations and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments or maintain our covenants with respect to our debt.
we are a parent company and our primary source of cash is and will be distributions from our subsidiaries.
we are a parent company with limited business operations of our own. our main asset is the capital stock of our subsidiaries. we conduct most of our business operations through our direct and indirect subsidiaries. accordingly, our primary sources of cash are dividends and distributions with respect to our ownership interests in our subsidiaries that are derived from the earnings and cash flow generated by our operating properties. our subsidiaries might not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to pay dividends or distributions in the future.
our subsidiaries' payments to us will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations. in addition, our subsidiaries' debt instruments and other agreements limit or prohibit certain payments of dividends or other distributions to us. we expect that future debt instruments for the financing of our other developments will contain similar restrictions. an inability of our subsidiaries to pay us dividends and distributions would have a significant negative effect on our liquidity.
our casino, hotel, convention and other facilities face intense competition, which may increase in the future.
the casino/hotel industry is highly competitive. our macau operations face intense competition with approximately 36 other casinos currently operating in macau. we hold a concession under one of only three gaming concessions and three subconcessions authorized by the macau government to operate casinos in macau. the macau government has had the ability to grant additional gaming concessions since april 2009. if the macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in macau through the grant of additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition, which
17
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. several of the current concessionaires and subconcessionaires will open additional facilities in the cotai area during 2017 and 2018. these cotai facilities are expected to increase total hotel room inventory by approximately 12.3% from the current inventory and significantly increase other gaming and non-gaming offerings in macau.
our macau operations face competition from casinos located in other areas of asia, such as singapore, the philippines and malaysia. we also encounter competition from other major gaming centers located around the world, including australia and las vegas, cruise ships in asia that offer gaming, and other casinos throughout asia. further, if current efforts to legalize gaming in other asian countries, such as japan, are successful, we will face additional regional competition.
our las vegas operations compete with other las vegas strip hotels and with other hotel casinos in las vegas on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment, theme and size, among other factors. wynn las vegas also competes with other casino/hotel facilities in other cities. the proliferation of gaming activities in other areas could significantly harm our business as well. in particular, the legalization or expansion of casino gaming in or near metropolitan areas from which we attract customers could have a negative effect on our business. in addition, new or renovated casinos in macau or elsewhere in asia could draw asian gaming customers away from wynn las vegas.
increased competition could result in a loss of customers, which may negatively affect our cash flows and results of operations.
our business relies on high-end, international customers. we often extend credit, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players or credit play may decrease.
general. a significant portion of our table games revenue at our resorts is attributable to the play of a limited number of international customers. the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. a downturn in economic conditions in the countries in which these customers reside could cause a reduction in the frequency of visits by and revenue generated from these customers.
we conduct our gaming activities on a credit as well as a cash basis. the casino credit we extend is generally unsecured and due on demand. we will extend casino credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources, in the opinion of management, warrant such an extension. the collectability of receivables from international customers could be negatively affected by future business or economic trends or by significant events in the countries in which these customers reside.
macau operations. although the law in macau permits casino operators to extend credit to gaming customers, our macau operations may not be able to collect all of its gaming receivables from its credit players. we expect that our macau operations will be able to enforce these obligations only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including macau. to the extent our gaming customers are visitors from other jurisdictions, we may not have access to a forum in which we will be able to collect all of our gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and we may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
currently, the gaming tax in macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. however, unlike nevada, the gross gaming revenue calculation in macau does not include deductions for uncollectible gaming debts. as a result, if we extend credit to our customers in macau and are unable to collect on the related receivables from them, we remain obligated to pay taxes on our winnings from these customers.
las vegas operations. while gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a "marker," are enforceable under the current laws of nevada, and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states of the united states under the full faith and credit clause of the united states constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that direct or indirect enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the united states of foreign debtors may be used to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from u.s. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. we cannot assure that we will be able to collect the full amount of gaming debts owed to us, even in jurisdictions that enforce them. changes in economic conditions may make it more difficult to assess creditworthiness and more difficult to collect the full amount of any gaming debt owed to us. our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.
18
win rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control.
the gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. in addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors, including players' skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets played, the amount of time played and undiscovered acts of fraud or cheating. our gross gaming revenues are mainly derived from the difference between our casino winnings and the casino winnings of our gaming customers. since there is an inherent element of chance in the gaming industry, we do not have full control over our winnings or the winnings of our gaming customers.
in addition, premium gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.
our new projects may not be successful.
in addition to the construction and regulatory risks associated with our current and future construction projects, we cannot assure you that the level of consumer demand for our casino resorts or for the type of luxury amenities that we will offer will meet our expectations. the operating results of our new projects may be materially different than the operating results of our current integrated resorts due to, among other reasons, differences in consumer and corporate spending and preferences in new geographic areas, increased competition from other markets or other developments that may be beyond our control.  in addition, our new projects may be more sensitive to certain risks, including risks associated with downturns in the economy, than the resorts we currently operate.  the demands imposed by new developments on our managerial, operational and other resources may impact our operation of our existing resorts. if any of these issues were to occur, it could adversely affect our prospects, financial condition, or results of operations.
we could encounter substantial cost increases higher than expected in the development of our projects.
we are currently constructing wynn boston harbor in everett, massachusetts. the total project budget for wynn boston harbor, including gaming license fees, construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses and land costs, is estimated to be approximately $2.4 billion.
the projected development costs for wynn boston harbor reflect our best estimates and the actual development costs may be higher than expected. contingencies that have been set aside by us to cover potential cost overruns or potential delays may be insufficient to cover the full amount of such overruns or delays. if these contingencies are not sufficient to cover these costs, or if we are not able to recover damages for these delays and contingencies, we may not have the funds required to pay the excess costs and this project may not be completed. failure to complete this project may negatively affect our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to pay our debt.
construction projects will be subject to development and construction risks, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
major construction projects of the scope and scale of wynn boston harbor entail significant risks, including:
•   unanticipated cost increases;
•   shortages of, and price increases in, materials or skilled labor;
•   changes to plans and specifications;
•   delays in obtaining or inability to obtain requisite licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities;
•   changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, real estate development or construction projects;
•   unforeseen engineering, environmental and/or geological problems;
•   labor disputes or work stoppages;
•   disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;
•   personal injuries to workers and other persons;
•   environment, health and safety issues, including site accidents;
•   delays or interference from severe weather or natural disasters;
•   geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and
•   unavailability of construction equipment.
19
construction, equipment or staffing problems or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities could increase the total cost, delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of wynn boston harbor.
we anticipate that only some of the subcontractors engaged for these projects will post bonds guaranteeing timely completion of the subcontractor's work and payment for all of that subcontractor's labor and materials. these bonds may not be adequate to ensure completion of the work.
our wynn boston harbor facility may not commence operations on schedule and construction costs for the project may exceed budgeted amounts. failure to complete the project on schedule or within budget may have a significant negative effect on us and on our ability to make payments on our debt.
we are currently required to commence gaming operations at wynn boston harbor by june 2020. if we are unable to meet this deadline, the massachusetts gaming commission may suspend or revoke our gaming license.
pursuant to the gaming act, the company is required to commence gaming operations at wynn boston harbor by june 2020, the date that is one year from our projected opening date of june 2019. if the company is unable to meet the current deadline and is unable to obtain an extension of the deadline from the mgc, the mgc may suspend or revoke our gaming license and, if we are found by the mgc after a hearing to have acted in bad faith, we will be assessed a fine of up to $50,000,000. failure to meet the deadline could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows from this planned facility.
we are subject to extensive state and local regulation, and licensing and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations. the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations and authorities could have a negative effect on our business.
the operations of our resorts are contingent upon our obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, findings of suitability, orders and authorizations in the jurisdictions in which our resorts are located. the laws, regulations and ordinances requiring these licenses, permits and other approvals generally relate to the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations, as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. the nevada gaming commission may require the holder of any debt or securities we or wynn las vegas, llc issue to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own wynn resorts' securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the state of nevada.
the company's articles of incorporation provide that, to the extent required by the gaming authority making the determination of unsuitability or to the extent the board of directors determines, in its sole discretion, that a person is likely to jeopardize the company's or any affiliate's application for, receipt of, approval for, right to the use of, or entitlement to, any gaming license, shares of wynn resorts' capital stock that are owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates are subject to redemption by wynn resorts. the redemption price may be paid in cash, by promissory note, or both, as required, and pursuant to the terms established by, the applicable gaming authority and, if not, as wynn resorts elects. on february 18, 2012, after receiving a report from freeh, sporkin & sullivan, llp (the "freeh report") detailing numerous instances of conduct constituting prima facie violations of the foreign corrupt practices act (the "fcpa") by kazuo okada (formerly the largest beneficial owner of wynn resorts' shares) and certain of his affiliates, the board of directors of wynn resorts determined that aruze usa inc. ("aruze"), universal entertainment corporation, and mr. kazuo okada (collectively, the "okada parties") were "unsuitable" within the meaning of article vii of wynn resorts' articles of incorporation and redeemed all of aruze's shares of wynn resorts' common stock. see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies."
nevada and massachusetts regulatory authorities have broad powers to request detailed financial and other information, to limit, condition, suspend or revoke a registration, gaming license or related approvals; approve changes in our operations; and levy fines or require forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or regulations. complying with gaming laws, regulations and license requirements is costly. any change in the nevada and massachusetts laws, regulations or licenses applicable to our business or a violation of any current or future laws or regulations applicable to our business or gaming licenses could require us to make substantial expenditures and forfeit assets, and would negatively affect our gaming operations.
our macau operations are subject to unique risks. failure to adhere to the regulatory and gaming environment in macau could result in the revocation of our macau operations' concession or otherwise negatively affect its operations in macau. moreover, we are subject to the risk that u.s. regulators could determine that macau's gaming regulatory framework has not
20
developed in a way that would permit us to conduct operations in macau in a manner consistent with the way in which we intend, or the nevada gaming authorities require us, to conduct our operations in the united states.
any violation of applicable anti-money laundering laws or regulations or the foreign corrupt practices act could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
we deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various jurisdictions' reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. recently, both u.s. and macau governmental authorities have increased their focus on the gaming industry and compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations. from time to time, the company receives governmental and regulatory inquiries about compliance with such laws and regulations.  the company cooperates with all such inquiries. any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
further, we have operations, and a significant portion of our revenue is derived outside of the united states. we are therefore subject to regulations imposed by the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit u.s. companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. violations of the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the sec and u.s. department of justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect such laws and regulations.
internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our directors, employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. if we or our directors, employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our operations, the company may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. any such government investigations, prosecutions or other legal proceedings or actions could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.
mr. okada failed to comply with internal training in these matters and failed to return to wynn resorts an executed acknowledgment agreeing to comply with the wynn resorts code of business conduct and ethics. on february 19, 2012, wynn resorts' filed a complaint in nevada state court against mr. okada and other entities alleging, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty in connection with alleged violations of the fcpa. for information on such complaint, the freeh report, which detailed numerous instances of conduct constituting prima facie violations of fcpa by mr. okada and certain of his affiliates, and the redemption aruze's shares, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies."
because we own real property, we are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.
we have incurred costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to discharges into the air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. under these and other environmental requirements we may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at our property. as an owner or operator, we could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by them in connection with any contamination.
these laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. the costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate a property properly, may impair our ability to use our property.
contamination has been identified at and in the vicinity of our site in everett, massachusetts. the ultimate cost of remediating contaminated sites is difficult to accurately predict and could exceed our current estimates. we may be required to conduct additional investigations and remediation with respect to this site. as a result, we also could incur material costs in excess of our estimates as a result of additional cleanup obligations imposed or contamination identified in the future.  our proposed expenditures related to environmental matters are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. however, the environmental laws under which we operate are
21
complicated and often increasingly more stringent, and may be applied retroactively. accordingly, we may be required to make additional expenditures to remain in, or to achieve compliance with, environmental laws in the future.
compliance with changing laws and regulations may result in additional expenses and compliance risks.
changing laws and regulations are creating uncertainty for gaming companies. these changing laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, recent issuance and/or lack of guidance. as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. in addition, further regulation of casinos, financial institutions and public companies is possible. this could result in continuing uncertainty and higher costs regarding compliance matters. due to our commitment to maintain high standards of compliance with laws and public disclosure, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expense. in addition, we are subject to different parties' interpretation of our compliance with these new and changing laws and regulations.
we are subject to taxation by various governments and agencies. the rate of taxation could change.
we are subject to tax by various governments and agencies, both in the u.s. and in macau. changes in the rates of taxation, the amount of taxes we owe and the time when income is subject to taxation, our ability to claim u.s. foreign tax credits, failure to renew our macau dividend agreement and macau income tax exemption and the imposition of foreign withholding taxes could increase our overall rate of taxation.
potential violations of law by mr. okada and his affiliates could have adverse consequences to the company.
the freeh reported detailed numerous instances of conduct constituting prima facie violations of the fcpa by mr. okada and certain of his affiliates. see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies." the company has provided the freeh report to applicable regulators and has been cooperating with related investigations of such regulators. the conduct of mr. okada and his affiliates and the outcome of any resulting regulatory findings could have adverse consequences to the company. a finding by regulatory authorities that mr. okada violated the fcpa on company property and/or otherwise involved the company in criminal or civil violations could result in actions by regulatory authorities against the company. relatedly, regulators have and may pursue separate investigations into the company's compliance with applicable laws in connection with the okada matter, as discussed in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies." while the company believes that it is in full compliance with all applicable laws, any such investigations could result in actions by regulators against the company, which could negatively affect the company's financial condition or results of operations.
mr. okada and his affiliates have challenged the redemption of aruze's shares. an adverse judgment or settlement resulting from the related litigation could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business.
on february 18, 2012, wynn resorts' gaming compliance committee received the freeh report detailing a pattern of misconduct by the okada parties. after receiving the freeh report, the board of directors of wynn resorts determined that each of the okada parties was "unsuitable" within the meaning of article vii of wynn resorts' articles of incorporation and redeemed all of aruze's shares of wynn resorts' common stock. see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies." on february 19, 2012, wynn resorts filed a complaint in the eighth judicial district court, clark county, nevada against the okada parties (as amended, the "complaint"), alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and related claims (the "redemption action") arising from the activities addressed in the freeh report. the company is seeking compensatory and special damages as well as a declaration that it acted lawfully and in full compliance with its articles of incorporation, bylaws and other governing documents in redeeming and canceling the shares of aruze. on march 12, 2012, the okada parties filed an answer denying the claims and a counterclaim (as amended, the "counterclaim") against the company, each of the members of the company's board of directors (other than mr. okada) and wynn resorts' general counsel (collectively, the "wynn parties"), seeking, among other things a declaration that the redemption of aruze's shares was void, an injunction restoring aruze's share ownership, damages in an unspecified amount and rescission of the amended and restated stockholders agreement, dated as of january 6, 2010, by and among aruze, stephen a. wynn, and elaine p. wynn (the "stockholders agreement"). in connection with the redemption action and counterclaim (1) various okada parties filed a complaint in the tokyo district court against the company, all members of the board of directors (other than mr. okada) and the company's general counsel alleging that the press release issued by the company in connection with the redemption action has damaged their social evaluation and credibility and seeking damages and legal fees, (2) four federal derivative actions were commenced against the company and all members of its board of directors, (3) two state derivative actions were commenced against the company and all members of its board of directors, (4) regulatory inquiries and investigations were initiated against the company, and (5) the okada parties filed a complaint in the court of first instance of macau (against
22
wynn macau sa and certain individuals who are or were directors of wynn macau sa and/or wynn macau, limited). see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies," for a full description of these matters and status as of the date of this report. the company is vigorously pursuing its claims against the okada parties, and together with the other counter-defendants, vigorously defending against the counterclaim and other actions asserted against them. however, as with all litigation, the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. any adverse judgments or settlements involving payment of a material sum of money could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could expose us to additional claims by third parties, including current or former investors or regulators. any adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business.
change in valuation of our redemption price promissory note could have a negative impact on our financial results.
we record the redemption note at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of the redemption note was $1.82 billion and $1.88 billion, respectively. in determining this fair value, we estimated the redemption note's present value using discounted cash flows with a probability-weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate, which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with the risk of the redemption note.
considerations for the redemption assumptions included the stated maturity of the redemption note, uncertainty of the related cash flows as well as potential effects of the following: uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and timing of pending litigation with the okada parties (see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies"); the outcome of on-going investigations of aruze by the united states attorney's office, the u.s. department of justice and the nevada gaming control board; and other potential legal and regulatory actions. in addition, in the furtherance of various future business objectives, we considered our ability, at our sole option, to prepay the redemption note at any time in accordance with its terms without penalty. accordingly, we reasonably determined that the estimated life of the redemption note could be less than the contractual life of the redemption note.
in determination of the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the redemption note's subordinated position and credit risk relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated with our traded debt were considered. observable inputs for the risk free rate were based on federal reserve rates for u.s. treasury securities and the credit risk spread was based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt.
a change in any of the assumptions discussed above could result in a change in the fair value of this redemption note and significantly impact our financial results.
ongoing litigation and other disputes with mr. okada and certain of his affiliates, as well as claims by ms. wynn, could distract management and result in negative publicity and additional scrutiny from regulators.
there has been widespread publicity of the findings in the freeh report of prima facie violations of law by mr. okada and his affiliates, the board of directors' unsuitability finding, the redemption of shares and related litigation. the actions, litigation, and publicity could reduce demand for shares of wynn resorts and wynn macau, limited and thereby have a negative impact on the trading prices of their respective shares. in addition, elaine p. wynn has asserted various claims against mr. wynn, the company and various company officers, which have and may continue to draw adverse publicity or impugn the company's reputation. ongoing litigation and other disputes can be expensive to defend and may divert management's attention from the operations of our businesses. the disputes may also lead to additional scrutiny from regulators, which could lead to investigations relating to, and possibly a negative impact on, the company's gaming licenses, and possibly have a negative impact on the company's ability to bid successfully for new gaming market opportunities.
our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.
we rely on information technology and other systems (including those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services) to maintain and transmit large volumes of customer financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information and other personally identifiable information. we also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. the systems and processes we have implemented to protect customers, employees and company information are subject to the ever-changing risk of compromised security. these risks include cyber and physical security breaches, system failure, computer viruses, and negligent or intentional misuse by customers, company employees, or employees of third-party vendors. the steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful and our insurance coverage for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. our third-party information system service providers
23
face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties' information security operations. a significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations and management team, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
our collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations and privacy law is an area that changes often and varies significantly by jurisdiction. compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. in addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us) or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage of reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data.
if a third party successfully challenges our ownership of, or right to use, the wynn-related trademarks and/or service marks, our business or results of operations could be harmed.
our intellectual property assets, especially the logo version of "wynn," are among our most valuable assets. we have filed applications with the pto and with various foreign patent and trademark registries including registries in macau, china, hong kong, singapore, taiwan, japan, certain european countries and various other jurisdictions throughout the world, to register a variety of wynn-related trademarks and service marks in connection with a variety of goods and services. these marks include "wynn resorts," "wynn design and development," "wynn las vegas," "wynn macau," "wynn palace" and "encore." some of the applications are based upon ongoing use and others are based upon a bona fide intent to use the marks in the future.
a common element of most of these marks is the use of the surname "wynn." as a general rule, a surname (or the portion of a mark primarily constituting a surname) is not eligible for registration unless the surname has acquired "secondary meaning." to date, we have been successful in demonstrating to the pto such secondary meaning for the wynn name, in certain of the applications, based upon factors including mr. wynn's prominence as a resort developer, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful with the other pending applications.
federal registrations are not completely dispositive of the right to such marks. third parties who claim prior rights with respect to similar marks may nonetheless challenge our right to obtain registrations or our use of the marks and seek to overcome the presumptions afforded by such registrations.
furthermore, due to the increased use of technology in computerized gaming machines and in business operations generally, other forms of intellectual property rights (such as patents and copyrights) are becoming of increased relevance. it is possible that, in the future, third parties might assert superior intellectual property rights or allege that their intellectual property rights cover some aspect of our operations. the defense of such allegations may result in substantial expenses, and, if such claims are successfully prosecuted, may have a material impact on our business. efforts we take to acquire and protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use throughout the world, which may include retaining counsel and commencing litigation in various jurisdictions, may be costly and may not be successful in protecting and preserving the status and value of our intellectual property assets.
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, including losses resulting from terrorism, and our insurance costs may increase.
we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our properties with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary in their breadth and scope. however, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or could result in certain losses being totally uninsured. as a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for debt or other financial obligations related to the property.
market forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain in the future or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. certain catastrophic losses may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. as a result, if we suffer such a catastrophic loss, we may not be successful in obtaining future insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels. furthermore, our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance. failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements, which would negatively affect our business and financial condition.

risks associated with our macau operations our macau operations may be affected by adverse political and economic conditions.
our macau operations, including wynn palace, are subject to significant political, economic and social risks inherent in doing business in an emerging market. macau's legislative, regulatory, legal, economic and cultural institutions are in a period of transition. the future success of our macau operations will depend on political and economic conditions in macau and mainland china. for example, fiscal decline and civil, domestic or international unrest in macau, china or the surrounding region could significantly harm our business, not only by reducing customer demand for casino resorts, but also by increasing the risk of imposition of taxes and exchange controls or other governmental restrictions, laws or regulations that might impede our macau operations or ability to repatriate funds.
we compete for limited labor resources in macau and macau government policies may also affect our ability to employ imported labor.
the success of our operations in macau will be affected by our success in hiring and retaining employees. we compete with a large number of casino resorts in macau for a limited number of qualified employees. in addition, the macau government requires that we only hire macau residents as dealers in our casinos. competition for these individuals in macau has increased and will continue to increase as other competitors expand their operations. we have to seek employees from other countries to adequately staff our resort and certain macau government policies affect our ability to import labor in certain job classifications. despite our coordination with the macau labor and immigration authorities to assure that our labor needs are satisfied, we may not be able to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees for our operations or obtain required work permits for those employees. if we are unable to obtain, attract, retain and train skilled employees, our ability to adequately manage and staff our existing and planned casino and resort properties in macau could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
the macau government has established a maximum number of gaming tables that can be operated in macau and has limited the number of new gaming tables at new gaming areas in macau.
prior to the opening of wynn palace, the dicj authorized 100 new table games for operation at wynn palace with 25 additional table games authorized for operation on january 1, 2017, and a further 25 new table games for operation on january 1, 2018, for a total of 150 new table games in the aggregate. in addition, we have and will continue to transfer table games between wynn macau and wynn palace, subject to the aggregate cap, to optimize our casino operations. as of february 15, 2017, we had a total of 303 table games at wynn macau and 304 at wynn palace.
the smoking control legislation in macau could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
in 2014, the macau government approved additional smoking control legislation, which prohibited smoking in casinos starting on october 6, 2014. the legislation, however, permits casinos to maintain certain limited smoking areas open to vip patrons if such areas are within restricted access areas, comply with certain square footage ratios based on overall gaming area square footage and comply with the conditions set out in the dispatch of the chief executive, dated november 1, 2012, as amended by the dispatch of the chief executive, dated june 3, 2014. prior public announcements by the macau government indicated that the macau government intended to pursue a full smoking ban within all macau casinos, but in february 2017, macau's health bureau proposed not pursuing a full ban and permitting casinos to have smoking lounges constructed in accordance with certain stringent technical standards still to be determined. the existing smoking legislation, and any smoking legislation intended to fully ban all smoking in casinos, may deter potential gaming customers who are smokers from frequenting casinos in macau and disrupt the number of patrons visiting or the amount of time visiting patrons spend at our property, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
macau may not have an adequate transportation infrastructure to accommodate the demand of visitors to macau.
because of additional casino projects which are under construction and to be developed in the future, the ferry and helicopter services which provide transportation between macau, hong kong, and mainland china may need to be expanded to accommodate the increased visitation to macau. if transportation facilities to and from macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting macau, the desirability of macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations of our macau operations, could be negatively impacted. furthermore, construction of current
25
and future casino projects, as well as any future infrastructure projects, adjacent to our properties could impede access to our properties during construction and development. this may negatively impact the results of our macau operations.
extreme weather conditions may have an adverse impact on our macau operations.
macau's subtropical climate and location on the south china sea are subject to extreme weather conditions including typhoons and heavy rainstorms. unfavorable weather conditions could negatively affect the profitability of our resorts and prevent or discourage guests from traveling to macau.
revenues from our macau gaming operations will end if we cannot secure an extension of our concession in 2022 or if the macau government exercises its redemption right beginning in 2017.
our concession agreement with the macau government expires in june 2022. unless our concession is extended, in june 2022, all of our gaming operations and related equipment in macau will be automatically transferred to the macau government without compensation to us and we will cease to generate any revenues from these operations. beginning in june 2017, the macau government may redeem the concession agreement by providing us at least one year's prior notice. in the event the macau government exercises this redemption right, we are entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. the amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of revenue generated during the tax year prior to the redemption multiplied for the remaining years under the concession. we may not be able to renew or extend our concession agreement on terms favorable to us or at all and, if our concession is redeemed, the compensation paid to us may not be adequate to compensate us for the loss of future revenues. the redemption of or failure to extend our concession would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
if our macau operations fail to comply with the concession agreement, the macau government can terminate our concession without compensation to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
the macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate our concession in the event of our material non-compliance with the basic obligations under the concession and applicable macau laws. the concession agreement expressly provides that the government of macau may unilaterally rescind the concession agreement of our macau operations if it:
•   conducts unauthorized games or activities that are excluded from its corporate purpose;
•   suspends gaming operations in macau for more than seven consecutive days (or more than 14 days in a civil year) without justification;
•   defaults in payment of taxes, premiums, contributions or other required amounts;
•   does not comply with government inspections or supervision;
•   systematically fails to observe its obligations under the concession system;
•   fails to maintain bank guarantees or bonds satisfactory to the government;
•   is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or becomes insolvent;
•   engages in serious fraudulent activity, damaging to the public interest; or
•   repeatedly violates applicable gaming laws.
if the government of macau unilaterally rescinds the concession agreement, our macau operations will be required to compensate the government in accordance with applicable law, and the areas defined as casino space under macau law and all of the gaming equipment pertaining to our gaming operations will be transferred to the government without compensation. the loss of our concession would prohibit us from conducting gaming operations in macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
certain nevada gaming laws apply to our macau operations' gaming activities and associations.
certain nevada gaming laws also apply to gaming activities and associations in jurisdictions outside the state of nevada. with respect to our macau operations, we and our subsidiaries that must be licensed to conduct gaming operations in nevada are required to comply with certain reporting requirements concerning gaming activities and associations in macau conducted by our macau-related subsidiaries. we and our licensed nevada subsidiaries also will be subject to disciplinary action by the nevada gaming commission if our macau-related subsidiaries:
•   knowingly violate any macau laws relating to their macau gaming operations;
•   fail to conduct our macau operations in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of nevada gaming operations;
•   engage in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable for us because it poses an unreasonable
26
threat to the control of gaming in nevada, reflects or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the state of nevada or gaming in nevada, or is contrary to nevada gaming policies;
•   engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the ability of the state of nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees; or
•   employ, contract with or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in nevada on the ground of unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.
such disciplinary action could include suspension, conditioning, limitation or revocation of the registration, licenses or approvals held by us and our licensed nevada subsidiaries, including wynn las vegas, llc, and the imposition of substantial fines.
in addition, if the nevada gaming control board determines that any actual or intended activities or associations of our macau-related subsidiaries may be prohibited pursuant to one or more of the standards described above, the nevada gaming control board can require us and our licensed nevada subsidiaries to file an application with the nevada gaming commission for a finding of suitability of the activity or association. if the nevada gaming commission finds that the activity or association in macau is unsuitable or prohibited, our macau-related subsidiaries will either be required to terminate the activity or association, or will be prohibited from undertaking the activity or association. consequently, should the nevada gaming commission find that our macau-related subsidiary's gaming activities or associations in macau are unsuitable, those subsidiaries may be prohibited from undertaking their planned gaming activities or associations in macau, or be required to divest their investment in macau, possibly on unfavorable terms.
we depend upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of our gaming revenue. if we are unable to maintain, or develop additional, successful relationships with reputable gaming promoters, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues could be adversely affected.
we may lose the clientele of our gaming promoters, who generate a significant portion of our gaming revenue. there is intense competition among casino operators in macau for services provided by gaming promoters, which has intensified as additional casinos open in macau. if we are unable to maintain, or develop additional, successful relationships with reputable gaming promoters, or lose a significant number of our gaming promoters to our competitors, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be adversely affected and we will have to seek alternative ways of developing relationships with vip customers. in addition, if our gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our vip customers, our ability to maintain or grow our gaming revenues will be hampered.
the financial resources of our gaming promoters may be insufficient to allow them to continue doing business in macau which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. our gaming promoters may experience difficulty in attracting patrons.
given present market conditions in macau and certain economic and other factors occurring in the region, gaming promoters are encountering difficulties in attracting patrons to come to macau. further, gaming promoters are experiencing decreased liquidity, limiting their ability to grant credit to their patrons, resulting in decreased gaming volume in macau and at our macau operations. credit already extended by our gaming promoters to their patrons has become difficult for them to collect. the inability to attract sufficient patrons, grant credit and collect amounts due in a timely manner are negatively affecting our gaming promoters' operations, causing gaming promoters to wind up or liquidate their operations or resulting in some of our gaming promoters leaving macau. current and any future difficulties could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
increased competition for the services of gaming promoters may require us to pay increased commission rates to gaming promoters.
certain gaming promoters have significant leverage and bargaining strength in negotiating operational agreements with casino operators. this leverage could result in gaming promoters negotiating changes to our operational agreements, including higher commissions, or the loss of business to a competitor or the loss of certain relationships with gaming promoters. if we need to increase our commission rates or otherwise change our practices with respect to gaming promoters due to competitive forces, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
27
failure by the gaming promoters with whom we work to comply with macau gaming laws and high standards of probity and integrity might affect our reputation and ability to comply with the requirements of our concession, macau gaming laws and other gaming licenses.
the reputations and probity of the gaming promoters with whom we work are important to our own reputation and to our ability to operate in compliance with our concession, macau gaming laws and other gaming licenses. we conduct periodic reviews of the probity and compliance programs of our gaming promoters. however, we are not able to control our gaming promoters' compliance with these high standards of probity and integrity, and our gaming promoters may violate provisions in their contracts with us designed to ensure such compliance. in addition, if we enter into a new business relationship with a gaming promoter whose probity is in doubt, this may be considered by regulators or investors to reflect negatively on our own probity. if our gaming promoters are unable to maintain required standards of probity and integrity, we may face consequences from gaming regulators with authority over our operations. furthermore, if any of our gaming promoters violate the macau gaming laws while on our premises, the macau government may, in its discretion, take enforcement action against us, the gaming promoter, or each concurrently, and we may be sanctioned and our reputation could be harmed.
unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates may increase our macau operations' obligations under the concession agreement and cause fluctuations in the value of our investment in macau.
the currency delineated in our macau operations' concession agreement with the government of macau is the macau pataca. the macau pataca is linked to the hong kong dollar, and the two are often used interchangeably in macau. the hong kong dollar is linked to the u.s. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. however, the exchange linkages of the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca, and the hong kong dollar and the u.s. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to changes in chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.
if the hong kong dollar and the macau pataca are no longer linked to the u.s. dollar, the exchange rate for these currencies may severely fluctuate. the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies may also change.
because many of our macau operations payment and expenditure obligations are in macau patacas, in the event of unfavorable macau pataca or hong kong dollar rate changes, our macau operations' obligations, as denominated in u.s. dollars, would increase. in addition, because we expect that most of the revenues for any casino that we operate in macau will be in hong kong dollars, we are subject to foreign exchange risk with respect to the exchange rate between the hong kong dollar and the u.s. dollar. also, if any of our macau-related entities incur u.s. dollar-denominated debt, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the macau pataca or the hong kong dollar, in relation to the u.s. dollar, could have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service its debt.
currency exchange controls and currency export restrictions could negatively impact our macau operations.
currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of currency by certain countries may negatively impact the success of our macau operations. for example, there are currently existing currency exchange controls and restrictions on the export of the renminbi, the currency of china. restrictions on the export of the renminbi may impede the flow of gaming customers from china to macau, inhibit the growth of gaming in macau and negatively impact our macau operations.
our macau subsidiaries' indebtedness is secured by a substantial portion of their assets.
subject to applicable laws, including gaming laws, and certain agreed upon exceptions, our macau subsidiaries' debt is secured by liens on substantially all of their assets. in the event of a default by such subsidiaries under their financing documents, or if such subsidiaries experience insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the holders of such secured debt would first be entitled to payment from their collateral security, and only then would holders of our macau subsidiaries' unsecured debt be entitled to payment from their remaining assets.
conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of wynn macau, limited.
wynn macau, limited, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of wynn resorts and the developer, owner and operator of wynn macau and wynn palace, listed its ordinary shares of common stock on the stock exchange of hong kong limited in october 2009. as of december 31, 2016, wynn resorts owns approximately 72% of wynn macau, limited's ordinary shares of common stock. as a result of wynn macau, limited having stockholders who are not affiliated with us, we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of wynn macau, limited may have conflicting fiduciary
28
obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of wynn macau, limited. decisions that could have different implications for wynn resorts and wynn macau, limited, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with wynn macau, limited, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest.
risks related to share ownership and stockholder matters our largest stockholders are able to exert significant influence over our operations and future direction.
as of december 31, 2016, mr. wynn and elaine p. wynn owned 12,000,000 shares and 9,611,927 shares, respectively, or in the aggregate approximately 21.2%, of our outstanding common stock. as a result, mr. wynn and elaine p. wynn, to the extent they vote their shares in a similar manner, may be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring our stockholders' approval, including the approval of significant corporate transactions.
under the stockholders agreement, mr. wynn and elaine p. wynn have agreed to vote the shares of wynn resorts' common stock held by them that are subject to the terms of the stockholders agreement in a manner so as to elect to our board of directors each of the nominees contained on each and every slate of directors endorsed by mr. wynn. as a result of this voting arrangement, mr. wynn, as a practical matter, exercises significant influence over the slate of directors to be elected to wynn resorts' board of directors. in addition, with stated exceptions, the stockholders agreement requires the written consent of the other party prior to any party selling any shares of wynn resorts' common stock that it owns.
in june 2012, in connection with the pending litigation between the company and aruze, elaine p. wynn submitted a cross claim against mr. wynn and mr. okada seeking to void the stockholders agreement, which, if successful, could result in a change in control under the wynn las vegas, llc debt documents. for additional information on the cross claim, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies."
in november 2006, the board of directors of wynn resorts approved an amendment of its bylaws that exempts future acquisitions of shares of wynn resorts' common stock by either mr. wynn or aruze from nevada's acquisition of controlling interest statutes. in light of the determination by the board of directors on february 18, 2012 that each of the okada parties is an "unsuitable person" under the company's articles of incorporation and the redemption and cancellation of aruze's shares of company common stock, our fifth amended and restated bylaws amended these provisions to delete the reference to aruze and its affiliates. the nevada acquisition of controlling interest statutes require stockholder approval in order to exercise voting rights in connection with any acquisition of a controlling interest in certain nevada corporations unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation in effect on the 10th day following the acquisition of a controlling interest by certain acquiring persons provide that these statutes do not apply to the corporation or to the acquisition specifically by types of existing or future stockholders. these statutes define a "controlling interest" as (i) one-fifth or more but less than one third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more, of the voting power in the election of directors. as a result of these bylaws provisions, mr. wynn or his affiliates may acquire ownership of outstanding voting shares of wynn resorts permitting him or them to exercise more than one-third but less than a majority, or a majority or more, of all of the voting power of the company in the election of directors, without requiring a resolution of the company's stockholders granting voting rights in the control shares acquired.
our stock price may be volatile.
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as general united states, china, and world economic and financial conditions, our own quarterly variations in operating results, increased competition, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, changes in applicable laws or regulations, and changes affecting the travel industry. the stock market in general, and prices for companies in our industry in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
risks related to our indebtedness we are highly leveraged and future cash flow may not be sufficient for us to meet our obligations, and we might have difficulty obtaining more financing.
we have a substantial amount of consolidated debt in relation to our equity. as of december 31, 2016, we had total outstanding debt of approximately $10.13 billion, which includes a portion of the funds we expect to need for the development and construction of our current projects. we may, however, incur additional indebtedness in connection with the construction of
29
these projects. see item 1-"business," "construction and development opportunities". in addition, we are permitted to incur additional indebtedness if certain conditions are met, including conditions under our wynn macau credit facilities, our wynn america credit facilities and our wynn las vegas, llc indentures in connection with other future potential development plans. on february 18, 2012, we issued a redemption note with a principal amount of approximately $1.94 billion in redemption of all of the shares of wynn resorts common stock held by aruze. as of december 31, 2016, the fair value of the redemption note was $1.82 billion. for additional information on the redemption and the redemption note, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies."
our indebtedness could have important consequences. for example:
•   failure to meet our payment obligations or other obligations could result in acceleration of our indebtedness, foreclosure upon our assets that serve as collateral or bankruptcy and trigger cross defaults under other agreements;
•   servicing our indebtedness requires a substantial portion of our cash flow from the operations of our las vegas and macau operations and reduces the amount of available cash, if any, to fund working capital and other cash requirements or pay for other capital expenditures;
•   the okada parties have challenged the redemption of aruze's shares and we are currently involved in litigation with those parties as well as related shareholder derivative litigation. the outcome of these various proceedings cannot be predicted. any adverse judgments or settlements involving payment of a material sum of money could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could expose us to additional claims by third parties including current or former investors or regulators. any adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business. see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies";
•   we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if needed; and
•   rates with respect to a portion of the interest we pay will fluctuate with market rates and, accordingly, our interest expense will increase if market interest rates increase.
under the terms of the documents governing our debt facilities, subject to certain limitations, we are permitted to incur indebtedness. if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above will be exacerbated.
the agreements governing our debt facilities contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.
some of our debt facilities require us to satisfy various financial covenants, which include requirements for minimum interest coverage ratios and leverage ratios pertaining to total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization and a minimum earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. for more information on financial covenants we are subject to under our debt facilities, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 9 "long-term debt." future indebtedness or other contracts could contain covenants more restrictive than those contained in our existing debt facilities.
the agreements governing our debt facilities also contain restrictions on our ability to engage in certain transactions and may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. these restrictions include, among other things, limitations on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:
•   pay dividends or distributions or repurchase equity;
•   incur additional debt;
•   make investments;
•   create liens on assets to secure debt;
•   enter into transactions with affiliates;
•   issue stock of, or member's interests in, subsidiaries;
•   enter into sale-leaseback transactions;
•   engage in other businesses;
•   merge or consolidate with another company;
•   undergo a change of control;
•   transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets;
•   issue disqualified stock;
•   create dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and
•   designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries.
30
our ability to comply with the terms of our outstanding facilities may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events outside of our control. as a result, we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants. if our properties' operations fail to generate adequate cash flow, we may violate those covenants, causing a default under our agreements, which would materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition or result in our lenders or holders of our debt taking action to enforce their security interests in our various assets or cause all outstanding amounts to be due and payable immediately.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we are a developer, owner and operator of destination casino resorts (integrated resorts). in macau, we own approximately 72% of wml and we operate the wynn macau and wynn palace resorts, which we refer to as our macau operations. in las vegas, nevada, with the exception of the majority of the retail space, we own 100% of and operate wynn las vegas or what we also refer to as las vegas operations. we are currently constructing wynn boston harbor, an integrated casino resort in everett, massachusetts.
macau operations wynn macau features two luxury hotel towers with a total of 1,008 guest rooms and suites, approximately 284,000 square feet of casino space, eight food and beverage outlets, approximately 31,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, approximately 57,000 square feet of retail space, a rotunda show and recreation and leisure facilities.
on august 22, 2016, we opened wynn palace, an integrated resort in the cotai area of macau. wynn palace features a luxury hotel tower with 1,706 guest rooms, suites and villas, approximately 420,000 square feet of casino space, 10 food and beverage outlets, approximately 40,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, approximately 105,000 square feet of retail space, public attractions, including a performance lake and floral art displays, and recreation and leisure facilities.
las vegas operations wynn las vegas features two luxury hotel towers with a total of 4,748 guest rooms, suites and villas, approximately 189,000 square feet of casino space, 33 food and beverage outlets, an on-site 18-hole golf course, approximately 290,000 square feet of meeting and convention space, approximately 99,000 square feet of retail space, as well as two showrooms, three nightclubs, a beach club, and recreation and leisure facilities.
in december 2016, we formed a joint venture with crown acquisitions inc. ("crown") to own and operate approximately 88,000 square feet of existing retail space (of which we own 50.1%) and signed an agreement with crown to form a joint venture to own and operate approximately 73,000 square feet of additional retail space that is currently under construction at wynn las vegas. we expect to open the additional retail space in the first quarter of 2018. for more information on the joint venture, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 3, "retail joint venture."
future development in november 2014, we were awarded a gaming license to develop and construct wynn boston harbor, an integrated resort in everett, massachusetts, adjacent to boston along the mystic river. the resort will contain a hotel, a waterfront boardwalk, meeting and convention space, casino space, a spa, retail offerings and food and beverage outlets. the total project budget, including gaming license fees, construction costs, capitalized interest, pre-opening expenses and land costs, is estimated to be approximately $2.4 billion. as of december 31, 2016, we have incurred approximately $466.8 million in total project costs. we expect to open wynn boston harbor in mid-2019.
we continually seek out new opportunities for additional gaming or related businesses, in the united states, and worldwide.
key operating measures certain key operating measures specific to the gaming industry are included in our discussion of our operational performance for the periods for which a consolidated statement of income is presented. below are definitions of these key operating measures discussed:
•   table drop for our macau operations is the amount of cash that is deposited in a gaming table's drop box plus cash chips purchased at the casino cage.
•   table drop for our las vegas operations is the amount of cash and net markers issued that are deposited in a gaming table's drop box.
36
•   turnover is the sum of all losing rolling chip wagers within our macau operations' vip program.
•   table games win is the amount of table drop or turnover that is retained and recorded as casino revenues.
•   rolling chips are identifiable chips that are used to track turnover for purposes of calculating incentives.
•   slot win is the amount of handle (representing the total amount wagered) that is retained by us and is recorded as casino revenues.
•   average daily rate ("adr") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any), by total rooms occupied, including complimentary rooms.
•   revenue per available room ("revpar") is calculated by dividing total room revenues, including the retail value of promotional allowances (less service charges, if any), by total rooms available.
•   occupancy is calculated by dividing total occupied rooms, including complimentary rooms, by the total rooms available.
below is a discussion of the methodologies used to calculate win percentages at our resorts.
in our vip operations in macau, customers primarily purchase non-negotiable chips, commonly referred to as rolling chips, from the casino cage. non-negotiable chips can only be used to make wagers. winning wagers are paid in cash chips. the loss of the non-negotiable chips in the vip operations is recorded as turnover and provides a base for calculating vip win percentage. it is customary in macau to measure vip play using this rolling chip method. we expect our win as a percentage of turnover from these operations to be within the range of 2.7% to 3.0%. in our mass market operations in macau, customers may purchase cash chips at either the gaming tables or at the casino cage.
the measurements from our vip and mass market operations are not comparable as the measurement method used in our mass market operations tracks the initial purchase of chips at the table and at the casino cage, while the measurement method from our vip operations tracks the sum of all losing wagers. accordingly, the base measurement from the vip operations is much larger than the base measurement from the mass market operations. as a result, the expected win percentage with the same amount of gaming win is smaller in the vip operations when compared to the mass market operations.
in las vegas, customers purchase chips at the gaming tables. the cash and net markers used to purchase chips are deposited in the gaming table's drop box. this is the base of measurement that we use for calculating win percentage in las vegas. each type of table game has its own theoretical win percentage. our expected table games win percentage in las vegas is 21% to 25%.

during the year ended december 31, 2015, our net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited was $195.3 million, a decrease of 73.3% over $731.6 million in the same period of 2014, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $1.92. the decrease in net income attributable to wynn resorts, limited was primarily due to weaker performance from wynn macau, driven by a 46.4% reduction in vip turnover compared to 2014, along with a loss on extinguishment of debt we experienced

during the year. adjusted property ebitda decreased year-over-year by 33.1%, from $1.77 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014 to $1.19 billion for the same period of 2015, primarily as a result of the weaker performance from wynn macau previously discussed.

net revenues increased 9.6%, or $390.4 million, for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015. the increase was primarily due to $583.3 million from wynn palace and an increase of $6.1 million from our las vegas operations, partially offset by a decrease of $199.0 million from wynn macau.

casino revenues were 73.2% of total net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 71.9% for the same period of 2015, while non-casino revenues were 26.8% of total net revenues, compared to 28.1% for the same period of 2015.
casino revenues casino revenues increased 11.4%, or $335.7 million, for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. the increase was primarily due to casino revenues of $519.9 million from wynn palace, partially offset by a $177.7 million decrease from wynn macau.  the decline in casino revenues from wynn macau was driven by a decrease in business volumes from both our vip and mass market operations, with decreases in vip turnover of 18.8%, table drop of 5.6% and slot handle of 14.5%. the business volume decrease for wynn macau was primarily driven by the continued impact from the current economic and political conditions in macau and china, as well as impact from recent resort openings in the cotai area of macau, including wynn palace. we experienced a vip win as a percentage of turnover of 3.29% for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 2.87% for the same period of 2015, which partially offset the business volume decrease in our vip operations.

prior to the opening of wynn palace, the gaming inspection and coordination bureau of macau authorized 100 new table games for operation at wynn palace with 25 additional table games authorized for operation on january 1, 2017, and a further 25 new table games for operation on january 1, 2018, for a total of 150 new table games in the aggregate. in addition, we have and will continue to transfer table games between wynn macau and wynn palace, subject to the aggregate cap, to optimize our casino operations. as of february 15, 2017, we had a total of 303 table games at wynn macau and 304 at wynn palace.

food and beverage revenues increased slightly by 0.7%, or $4.4 million, to $601.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $597.1 million for the same period of 2015, primarily due to $27.1 million from wynn palace, partially offset by decreases of $12.0 million and $10.7 million from our las vegas operations and wynn macau, respectively. our las vegas operations decreased primarily due to a decline in revenues at our nightclubs and the decrease from wynn macau was mainly from a decline in revenues at our restaurants.
entertainment, retail and other increased 3.7%, or $12.8 million, to $363.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $350.6 million for the same period of 2015. the increase was primarily due to $38.0 million from wynn palace, partially offset by a $19.3 million decrease in revenue from retail shops at wynn macau.
promotional allowances increased 8.0%, or $27.3 million, to $370.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $342.7 million for the same period of 2015. as a percentage of total casino revenues, promotional allowances were 11.3% for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 11.7% for the same period of 2015.
operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses increased 15.4%, or $527.6 million, to $3.94 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $3.42 billion for the same period of 2015, driven primarily by increases in casino expenses of $217.1 million, general and administrative expenses of $83.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $82.1 million and pre-opening costs of $77.1 million, all mainly due to the opening of wynn palace.
casino expenses increased 11.7%, or $217.1 million, to $2.08 billion for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $1.86 billion for the same period of 2015. the increase was commensurate with the 11.4% increase in casino revenues.
room expenses increased 6.0%, or $8.9 million, to $157.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $149.0 million for the same period of 2015. the increase was primarily due to $16.4 million from wynn palace and a $4.3 million increase from our las vegas operations, partially offset by an $11.6 million decrease from wynn macau.
food and beverage expenses increased 3.9%, or $14.0 million, to $375.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $361.2 million for the same period of 2015, primarily related to wynn palace.
entertainment, retail and other expenses increased 2.4%, or $3.7 million, to $161.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $157.4 million for the same period of 2015. the increase was primarily due to $8.9 million from wynn palace, partially offset by a decrease of $4.8 million from wynn macau.
general and administrative expenses increased 17.9%, or $83.3 million, to $548.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $464.8 million for the same period of 2015. the increase was primarily due to $73.9 million from wynn palace, as well as increases in general and administrative expenses from our las vegas operations and corporate related expenses.
provision for doubtful accounts decreased $2.9 million, or 26.2%, to $8.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $11.1 million for the same period of 2015. the change in the provision was primarily due to increased collections of casino accounts receivable at wynn macau.
pre-opening costs were $154.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $77.6 million for the same period of 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we incurred $129.8 million related to wynn palace, $22.7 million related to wynn boston harbor, and $2.3 million related to our las vegas operations. during the year ended december 31, 2015 we incurred pre-opening costs of $55.1 million and $22.6 million related to wynn palace and wynn boston harbor, respectively.
depreciation and amortization increased 25.4%, or $82.1 million, to $404.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, from $322.6 million for the same period of 2015. the increase was attributable to $105.9 million from wynn palace, primarily from the opening and associated building and furniture, fixtures and equipment placed in service, partially offset by a decrease of $14.1 million at wynn macau. the majority of the wynn macau decrease was due to a change in estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements, which was effective september 1, 2015, to more accurately reflect the estimated periods during which these assets are expected to remain in service.
41
property charges and other were $54.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to $10.5 million for the same period of 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we incurred a $15.5 million exit fee for the right to procure energy from the wholesale energy markets instead of from the local public electric utility by our las vegas operations and $14.1 million for the write-down of the carrying value to the purchase price of an aircraft we sold in january 2017. in addition, we incurred expenses of $10.1 million in abandonment charges related to current construction of additional retail space at our las vegas operations and $5.5 million for the write-off of show production costs due to the closing of steve wynn's showstoppers in december 2016.

interest cost increased $29.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to an increase in our weighted average total debt balance, partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate. capitalized interest increased $40.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily due to the $25.6 million correction of an immaterial amount during 2016 as well as the construction of wynn palace. during the first quarter of 2016, we corrected immaterial amounts of additional interest of $25.6 million that should have been capitalized instead of being expensed during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. had these amounts been corrected in the appropriate periods, the capitalized interest for the year ended december 31, 2015, would have been $21.9 million higher. for further information, see item 1-"notes to consolidated financial statements," note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies."
other non-operating income and expenses we incurred gains of $65.0 million and $52.0 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from the change in fair value of the redemption note. the change in fair value was a result of changes in certain variables to calculate the estimated fair value. for further information on the fair value of the redemption note, see item 1-"notes to consolidated financial statements," note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies."
we incurred a loss of $126.0 million on the extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2015, in connection with the cash tender offer for the 7 7/8% first mortgage notes due may 1, 2020 and the 7 3/4% 2020 first mortgage notes due august 15, 2020 (together the "2020 notes"), subsequent redemption of the untendered 2020 notes and the amendment of our wynn macau credit facilities. we expensed $98.9 million for the consideration paid to holders who tendered the 2020 notes, $17.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount and $0.1 million in other fees incurred. in connection with the redemption of the remaining principal amount of the untendered 2020 notes, we recorded a loss for the premium portion of the consideration of $5.9 million and expensed $1.8 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and original discount. in connection with the amendment of the wynn macau credit facilities, we expensed $2.1 million of unamortized deferred financing costs. we incurred no loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2016.
we incurred a gain of $0.4 million and a loss of $5.3 million from the change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. for further information on our interest rate swaps, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies."

net revenues decreased 25.0% to $4.08 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $5.43 billion for the same period in 2014. the decline in net revenues was primarily driven by a decrease of 35.5%, or $1.27 billion, in casino revenue from our macau operations.

$4,075,883                  $5,433,661         (25.0   )
casino revenues were 71.9% of total net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 78.7% of total net revenues for the same period of 2014, while non-casino revenues were 28.1% of total net revenues, compared to 21.3% in the prior year. this increase in non-casino revenues as a percentage of total net revenues reflects performance of non-gaming amenities, such as las vegas nightclubs and continued high occupancy and use of our facilities, in contrast to the decline in vip gaming revenue in macau.
casino revenues casino revenues decreased 31.4% to $2.93 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $4.27 billion in the same period of 2014. the decline was primarily due to the continued weak gaming environment affecting our macau operations, which experienced a year-over-year decrease in casino revenues of 35.5% from $3.59 billion to $2.31 billion. our vip gaming operations drove the decline with $57.92 billion in vip turnover for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $108.08 billion for the same period of 2014. in addition, our macau operations' mass market gaming contributed to the decline with a 12.0% decrease in table drop combined with a reduction in table games win percentage of 1.9 percentage points. our vip tables decreased from 248 as of december 31, 2014 to 190 as of december 31, 2015, based on the operating environment and customer demand.

food and beverage revenues decreased $7.6 million to $597.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $604.7 million for the same period of 2014. we experienced a decline of $24.0 million in food and beverage revenues from our macau operations, mainly from restaurants, partially offset by an increase of $16.4 million in food and beverage revenues from our las vegas operations, which was driven by increases in revenues at nightclubs and from catering and banquets.
entertainment, retail and other decreased 12.6%, or $50.6 million, to $350.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $401.2 million for the same period of 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a decline in revenue from retail shops at our macau operations.
promotional allowances decreased 11.9%, or $46.5 million, to $342.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $389.2 million for the same period of 2014. as a percentage of total casino revenues, promotional allowances were 11.7% for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to 9.1% for the same period of 2014, as the decline in total complimentaries was less than the decline in total revenues.
operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses decreased 18.0%, or $750.3 million, to $3.42 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $4.17 billion for the same period of 2014, mainly from a decrease in casino expenses.
casino expenses decreased 30.2%, or $804.3 million, to $1.86 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $2.67 billion for the same period of 2014, primarily due to lower gaming taxes from the 39% gross win tax incurred at our macau operations. the decline in gaming taxes was commensurate with the 35.5% decrease in casino revenues at our macau operations.
room expenses were relatively flat for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the same period of 2014.
food and beverage expenses increased 7.1%, or $24.0 million, to $361.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $337.2 million for the same period of 2014, due primarily to an increase of $21.8 million from our las vegas operations. the increase was primarily a result of higher costs in the current period for entertainment at wynn las vegas nightclubs.
entertainment, retail and other expenses decreased 3.9%, or $6.3 million, to $157.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $163.8 million in the same period of 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in merchandise cost at our macau operations associated with the decline in retail shop revenues, partially offset by an increase from our las vegas operations due to costs associated with steve wynn's showstoppers, which opened in december 2014.
46
general and administrative expenses decreased 5.6%, or $27.7 million, to $464.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $492.5 million in the same period of 2014, primarily attributable to a decrease in corporate related expenses.
provision for doubtful accounts increased $7.2 million, or 184.6%, to $11.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $3.9 million for the same period of 2014. the change in the provision was primarily due to the impact of historical collection patterns and current collection trends, as well as specific review of customer accounts and outstanding gaming promoter accounts, on our estimated allowance for the respective periods.
pre-opening costs were $77.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $30.1 million for the same period of 2014 and were primarily associated with the design and planning for our development projects. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we incurred $55.1 million related to wynn palace and $22.6 million related to wynn boston harbor. pre-opening costs for the year ended december 31, 2014 related to wynn palace.
depreciation and amortization increased 2.7%, or $8.5 million, to $322.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, from $314.1 million for the same period of 2014. the increase was primarily due to additional depreciation associated with building improvements at our macau operations, including our new vip gaming rooms. the increase was partially offset by a $7.4 million reduction in depreciation due to a change in the estimated useful lives of certain assets in macau during 2015.

our interest cost increased $5.7 million to $354.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, due to an increase in our weighted average total debt balance, partially offset by a decrease in our weighted average interest rate. capitalized interest increased $19.9 million to $53.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to the construction of wynn palace. financing activities during 2015 include the issuance of the 5 1/2% senior notes due 2025 ("2025 notes"), cash tender offer and subsequent redemption of the 2020 notes and the amendment of the wynn macau credit facilities. financing activities during 2014 include the issuance of 5 1/4% senior notes due 2021.
other non-operating income and expenses we incurred losses of $126.0 million on the extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to losses of $9.6 million in 2014. during the year ended december 31, 2015, in connection with the cash tender offer and subsequent redemption of the untendered 2020 notes, we incurred a loss of $123.9 million associated with the premium paid, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount and other fees. in addition, we incurred a loss of $2.1 million related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the amendment of our wynn macau credit facilities. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the loss was for the premium paid on the 2020 notes through open market transactions and the write-off of related unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized a gain of $52.0 million from the change in fair value of the redemption note as a result of changes in certain variables used in the estimated fair value. no change was recognized in the same period of 2014.
47
we incurred losses of $5.3 million and $4.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from the change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps.
interest income was $7.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $20.4 million in 2014. during 2015 and 2014, our short-term investment strategy was to preserve capital while retaining sufficient liquidity. the majority of our short-term investments were in time deposits, fixed deposits and money market accounts with a maturity of three months or less.
income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded a tax expense of $7.7 million and a tax benefit of $3.8 million, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2015, our income tax expense was primarily related to an increase in our deferred tax liabilities. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our income tax benefit was primarily related to a release of valuation allowance on prior year foreign tax credits resulting from the implementation of a tax planning strategy.
for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, we were exempt from the payment of $41.6 million and $99.4 million, respectively, under our exemption from the macau complementary tax on gaming profits. our non-gaming profits remain subject to the macau complementary tax and casino winnings remain subject to the macau special gaming tax and other levies together totaling 39% in accordance with our concession agreement.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $86.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to $231.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. these amounts represent the noncontrolling interests' share of net income from wynn macau, limited for each year.
adjusted property ebitda we use adjusted property ebitda to manage the operating results of our segments. adjusted property ebitda is net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening costs, property charges and other, management and license fees, corporate expenses and other (including intercompany golf course and water rights leases), stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in interest rate swap fair value, change in redemption note fair value and other non-operating income and expenses, and includes equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates. adjusted property ebitda is presented exclusively as a supplemental disclosure because we believe that it is widely used to measure the performance, and as a basis for valuation, of gaming companies. we use adjusted property ebitda as a measure of the operating performance of our segments and to compare the operating performance of our properties with those of our competitors, as well as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation. we also present adjusted property ebitda because it is used by some investors as a way to measure a company's ability to incur and service debt, make capital expenditures and meet working capital requirements. gaming companies have historically reported ebitda as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"). in order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their ebitda calculations pre-opening expenses, property charges, corporate expenses and stock-based compensation that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. however, adjusted property ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with gaap. unlike measures of net income, adjusted property ebitda does not include depreciation or interest expense and therefore does not reflect current or future capital expenditures or the cost of capital. we have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in adjusted property ebitda. also, our calculation of adjusted property ebitda may be different from the calculation methods used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

adjusted property ebitda for our las vegas operations was relatively flat for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015.
adjusted property ebitda at wynn macau and for our las vegas operations decreased year-over-year by 43.7% and 7.4%, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily due to the decline in casino revenues.
refer to the discussions above regarding the specific details of our results of operations.
liquidity and capital resources operating activities our operating cash flows primarily consist of our operating income generated by our macau and las vegas operations (excluding depreciation and other non-cash charges), interest paid and earned, and changes in working capital accounts such as receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and payables. our table games play both in macau and las vegas is a mix of cash play and credit play, while our slot machine play is conducted primarily on a cash basis. a significant portion of our table games revenue is attributable to the play of a limited number of premium international customers that gamble on credit. the ability to collect these gaming receivables may impact our operating cash flow for the period. our rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail, and other revenue is conducted primarily on a cash basis or as a trade receivable. accordingly, operating cash flows will be impacted by changes in operating income and accounts receivable.
net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $970.5 million, compared to $572.8 million for the same period of 2015. the increase was primarily due to the change in customer deposits and working capital accounts from our macau operations.
net cash provided by operations for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $572.8 million, compared to $1.10 billion for the same period of 2014. the reduction was primarily due to lower operating income generated by our macau operations and from the change in working capital accounts.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $1.29 billion, which was primarily attributable to $1.23 billion in capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention. capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention, consisted primarily of $838.3 million for wynn palace and $212.2 million for wynn boston harbor.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $1.89 billion, which was primarily attributable to $1.92 billion in capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention, with $1.57 billion related to wynn palace.

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was $1.11 billion, which was primarily attributable to $1.22 billion in capital expenditures, net of construction payables and retention, with $982.4 million related to wynn palace. we also used $86.7 million in cash for payment of our massachusetts gaming license.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $691.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, which was primarily attributable to borrowings of $930.0 million under our wynn america credit facility and proceeds of $217.0 million from the sale of a 49.9% ownership interest in a subsidiary, partially offset by $325.2 million for the payment of dividends.
net cash provided by financing activities was $1.22 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, which was primarily attributable to net borrowings of $1.62 billion under our amended wynn macau credit facilities, partially offset by $499.1 million for the payment of dividends. we also issued $1.8 billion of 2025 notes and used the proceeds for the purchase of $1.6 billion of our 2020 notes.
net cash used in financing activities was $235.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, which was primarily attributable to the payment of dividends of $942.9 million and payments on our long-term debt, partially offset by proceeds of $755.6 million from the issuance of senior notes and $132.6 million from borrowings, net of repayments, under our wynn macau revolving credit facility. during 2014, we used $98.4 million for open market purchases of principal on our first mortgage notes and $31.5 million for the repayment of the remaining principal on our note payable secured by aircraft.
capital resources as of december 31, 2016, we had approximately $2.45 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $301.5 million of available-for-sale investments in domestic and foreign debt securities and commercial paper. cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in bank and fixed deposits, investments in money market funds, domestic and foreign bank time deposits and commercial paper, all with original maturities of less than 90 days. of these amounts, wml and its subsidiaries (of which we own approximately 72%) held $334.2 million in cash. if our portion of this cash was repatriated to the u.s. on december 31, 2016, it would be subject to minimal u.s. taxes in the year of repatriation. wynn las vegas, llc held cash balances of $225.7 million. wynn resorts, limited (including its subsidiaries other than wml and wynn las vegas, llc), which is not a guarantor of the debt of its subsidiaries, held $1.89 billion and $301.5 million of cash and available-for-sale investments, respectively.
the wynn macau credit facilities consist of a $2.30 billion equivalent fully funded senior secured term loan facility and a $750.0 million equivalent senior secured revolving credit facility (together, the "wynn macau credit facilities"). borrowings under the wynn macau credit facilities consist of both united states dollar and hong kong dollar tranches and were used to refinance wynn macau sa's existing indebtedness and fund the construction and development of wynn palace and will be used for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2016, we had $409.2 million of available borrowing capacity under the senior secured revolving credit facility.
the wynn america credit facilities consist of a $375 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $1.0 billion fully funded senior secured term loan facility (together, the "wynn america credit facilities"). borrowings under the wynn america credit facilities are and will be used to fund the development, construction and pre-opening expenses of wynn boston harbor and for general corporate purposes. on june 21, 2016, we amended the wynn america credit facilities to extend the available borrowing period for $649.7 million of the delay draw senior secured term loan facility from june 30, 2016 to december 31, 2016. on july 1, 2016, we amended the wynn america credit facilities to increase the existing $875 million senior secured term loan facility (the "wa senior term loan facility i") by a principal amount of $125 million with the available borrowing period ending on december 31, 2016 (such increase, the "wa senior term loan facility ii"). as of december 31, 2016, the available borrowing capacity under the wynn america credit facilities was $361.3 million, net of $13.7 million in outstanding letters of credit.
the wml finance i, limited credit facility consists of a hk$1.55 billion (approximately $199.7 million) cash-collateralized revolving credit facility ("wml finance credit facility"). borrowings under the wml finance credit facility are in hong kong dollars and are used for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. on october 25, 2016, we amended the wml finance credit facility to increase the principal amount up to hk$3.87 billion (approximately $499.0 million). as of december 31, 2016, the company had $309.4 million of available borrowing capacity under the wml finance credit facility.

we expect that our future cash needs will relate primarily to operations, funding of development projects and enhancements to our operating resorts, debt service and retirement and general corporate purposes. we expect to meet our cash needs including our contractual obligations with future anticipated cash flow from operations, availability under our bank credit facilities and our existing cash balances. we intend to primarily fund our current development project, wynn boston harbor, with the available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facilities.
macau related debt our macau related debt consists of senior notes, the wynn macau credit facilities, and the wml finance credit facility.
2021 notes. on march 20, 2014, wml issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5 1/4% senior notes due 2021 (the "additional 2021 notes"), which were consolidated and form a single series with the $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5 1/4% senior notes due 2021 issued by wml on october 16, 2013 (the "original 2021 notes" and together with the "additional 2021 notes," the "2021 notes").
the 2021 notes bear interest at the rate of 5 1/4% per annum and will mature on october 15, 2021. interest on the 2021 notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on april 15 and october 15 of each year, beginning on april 15, 2014. at any time on or before october 14, 2016, wml may redeem the 2021 notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes or (b) a "make-whole" amount as determined by an independent investment banker in accordance with the terms of the indenture for the 2021 notes, dated as of october 16, 2013 (the "wml indenture"). in either case, the redemption price would include accrued and unpaid interest. in addition, on or after october 15, 2016, wml may redeem the 2021 notes, in whole or in part, at a premium decreasing annually from 103.94% of the principal amount to zero, plus accrued and unpaid interest. if wml undergoes a change of control (as defined in the wml indenture), it must offer to repurchase the 2021 notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. in addition, we may redeem the 2021 notes, in whole but not in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in response to any change in or amendment to certain tax laws or tax positions. further, if a holder or beneficial owner of the 2021 notes fails to meet certain requirements imposed by any gaming authority (as defined in the wml indenture), wml may require the holder or beneficial owner to dispose of or redeem its 2021 notes.
the 2021 notes are wml's general unsecured obligations and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of wml's existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; will rank senior to all of wml's future subordinated indebtedness, if any; will be effectively subordinated to all of wml's future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt; and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of wml's subsidiaries, including wynn macau sa's existing credit facilities. the 2021 notes are not registered under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and the 2021 notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale.

the wynn macau credit facilities contain a requirement that wynn macau sa must make mandatory repayments of indebtedness from specified percentages of excess cash flow. if wynn macau sa's leverage ratio is greater than 4.5 to 1, then 25% of excess cash flow (as defined in the wynn macau credit facilities) must be used for prepayment of indebtedness and cancellation of available borrowings under the wynn macau credit facilities. there is no mandatory prepayment in respect of excess cash flow if wynn macau sa's leverage ratio is equal to or less than 4.5 to 1.
the wynn macau credit facilities contain customary covenants restricting certain activities including, but not limited to: the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the incurrence or creation of liens on any of its property, sale and leaseback transactions, the ability to dispose of assets, and making loans or other investments. in addition, wynn macau sa is required by the financial covenants to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than 5.5 to 1 for the fiscal year ending december 31, 2016, and an interest coverage ratio (as defined in the wynn macau credit facilities) of not less than 2.00 to 1 at any time.

we provided a completion guaranty in favor of the lenders under the wynn america credit facilities to support the development and opening of wynn boston harbor. wynn america and the guarantors have entered into a security agreement in favor of the lenders under the wynn america credit facilities pursuant to which, subject to certain exceptions, wynn america and the guarantors have pledged all equity interests in the guarantors to the extent permitted by applicable law and granted a first priority security interest in substantially all of the other existing and future assets of the guarantors.
redemption note. based on the board of directors' finding of "unsuitability," on february 18, 2012, we redeemed and canceled aruze's 24,549,222 shares of wynn resorts' common stock. following a finding of "unsuitability," our articles of incorporation authorize redemption at "fair value" of the shares held by unsuitable persons. pursuant to the articles of incorporation, we issued the redemption note to aruze, a former stockholder and related party, in redemption of the shares. the redemption note has a principal amount of approximately $1.94 billion, matures on february 18, 2022 and bears interest at the rate of 2% per annum, payable annually in arrears on each anniversary of the date of the redemption note. we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, at any time and from time to time, and without penalty or premium, prepay the whole or any portion of the principal or interest due under the redemption note. in no instance shall any payment obligation under the redemption note be accelerated except in the sole and absolute discretion of wynn resorts or as specifically mandated by law. the indebtedness evidenced by the redemption note, is subordinated to the prior payment in full of all existing and future obligations of wynn resorts and any of its affiliates in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of any kind or nature. aruze, universal entertainment corporation and kazuo okada have challenged the redemption of aruze's shares and we are currently involved in litigation with those parties as well as related shareholder derivative litigation. the outcome of these various proceedings cannot be predicted. any adverse judgments or settlements involving payment of a material sum of money could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could expose us to additional claims by third parties, including current or former investors or regulators. any adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business. see item 1a-"risk factors" and item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies."
other factors affecting liquidity wynn resorts is a holding company and, as a result, our ability to pay dividends is highly dependent on our ability to obtain funds and our subsidiaries' ability to provide funds to us. wynn las vegas, llc, wynn america, llc and wynn macau sa debt instruments contain customary negative covenants and financial covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict their ability to pay dividends or distributions.
wynn las vegas, llc intends to fund its operations and capital requirements from cash on hand and operating cash flow. we cannot assure you however, that our las vegas operations will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or the availability of additional indebtedness will be sufficient to enable us to service and repay wynn las vegas, llc's indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. similarly, we expect that our macau operations will fund wynn macau sa and wml's debt service obligations with existing cash, operating cash flow and availability under the wynn macau credit facilities. however, we cannot assure you that operating cash flows will be sufficient to do so. we may refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of the indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.
legal proceedings in which we are involved also may impact our liquidity. no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of such proceedings. in addition, litigation inherently involves significant costs. for information regarding legal proceedings, see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies."
our board of directors has authorized an equity repurchase program of up to $1.7 billion. the repurchase program may include repurchases from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, and under plans complying with rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the exchange act. as of december 31, 2016, we had purchased a cumulative total of 12,804,954 shares of our common stock for a net cost of $1.1 billion under the program, with no purchases made under this program during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
we have in the past repurchased, and in the future, we may periodically consider repurchasing our outstanding notes for cash. the amount of any notes to be repurchased, as well as the timing of any repurchases, will be based on business, market and other conditions and factors, including price, contractual requirements or consents, and capital availability.
54
new business developments or other unforeseen events may occur, resulting in the need to raise additional funds. we continue to explore opportunities to develop additional gaming or related businesses in domestic and international markets. there can be no assurances regarding the business prospects with respect to any other opportunity. any new development would require us to obtain additional financing. we may decide to conduct any such development through wynn resorts or through subsidiaries separate from the las vegas or macau-related entities.
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities nor do we engage in any derivatives, except for interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts. we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. as of december 31, 2016, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $13.7 million.
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december 31, 2016 (in millions):
payments due by period less                 1 to 3                 4 to 5       after                            total than                  years                  years       5 years

(1)   amounts for all periods represent our estimated future interest payments on our debt facilities based upon amounts outstanding and libor or hibor rates as of december 31, 2016. such rates continue at historical lows as of december 31, 2016. actual rates will vary.
(2)   other includes open purchase orders, future charitable contributions, fixed gaming tax payments in macau, performance contracts and other contracts. as further discussed in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 16 "income taxes" of this report, we had $90.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2016. due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year and therefore it is not included in the table above as of december 31, 2016.
(3)   other excludes community payments associated with the continuing operations of wynn boston harbor, which commence upon the opening of the resort. these amounts are approximately $10.5 million per year with minimal annual increases.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with u.s. gaap. a summary of our significant accounting policies are presented in item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies." certain of our accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions integral to financial estimates. on an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates, including those relating to the estimated lives of depreciable assets, asset impairment, allowances for doubtful accounts, accruals for customer loyalty programs, contingencies, litigation and other items. judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. however, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and therefore actual results could differ from our estimates.
development, construction and property and equipment estimates during the construction and development of a resort, pre-opening or start-up costs are expensed when incurred. in connection with the construction and development of our resorts, significant start-up costs are incurred and charged to pre-opening costs through their respective openings. once our resorts open, expenses associated with the opening of the resorts are no longer charged as pre-opening costs.
55
during the construction and development stage, direct costs such as those incurred for the design and construction of our resorts, including applicable portions of interest, are capitalized. accordingly, the recorded amounts of property and equipment increase significantly during construction periods. depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. we determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, estimate of the usage of the asset, and other factors specific to the asset. depreciation expense related to capitalized construction costs is recognized when the related assets are placed in service. upon the opening of our resorts, we begin recognizing depreciation expense on the fixed assets. the remaining estimated useful lives of assets are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary.
costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. the cost and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or otherwise disposed of are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in property charges and other.
we also evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting standards. for assets to be disposed of we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow model. for assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. in reviewing for impairment, we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. if an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. all recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used are recorded as operating expenses.
redemption price promissory note we record the redemption note at its fair value in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value of the redemption note was $1.82 billion and $1.88 billion, respectively. we utilized an independent third party valuation to assist in the determination of this fair value. in determining this fair value, we estimated the redemption note's present value using discounted cash flows with a probability-weighted expected return for redemption assumptions and a discount rate, which included time value and non-performance risk adjustments commensurate with the risk of the redemption note.
considerations for the redemption assumptions included the stated maturity of the redemption note, uncertainty of the related cash flows as well as potential effects of the following: uncertainties surrounding the potential outcome and timing of pending litigation with the okada parties (see item 8-"financial statements and supplementary data," note 17 "commitments and contingencies"); the outcome of ongoing investigations of aruze by the united states attorney's office, the u.s. department of justice and the nevada gaming control board; and other potential legal and regulatory actions. in addition, in the furtherance of various future business objectives, we considered our ability, at our sole option, to prepay the redemption note at any time in accordance with its terms without penalty. accordingly, we reasonably determined that the estimated life of the redemption note could be less than the contractual life of the redemption note.
in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used in the estimated present value, the redemption note's subordinated position and credit risk relative to all other debt in our capital structure and credit ratings associated with our traded debt were considered. observable inputs for the risk free rate based on federal reserve rates for u.s. treasury securities and credit risk spread based on a yield curve index of similarly rated debt were used.
retail joint venture on december 28, 2016, we formed a joint venture (the "retail joint venture") with crown to own and operate approximately 88,000 square feet of existing retail space at wynn las vegas. in connection with the transaction, we transferred certain assets and liabilities with a net book value of $31.8 million associated with the existing wynn las vegas retail stores from wynn las vegas, llc, to the retail joint venture. we sold crown a 49.9% ownership interest in the retail joint venture for consideration of $292.0 million, which consisted of $217.0 million in cash and a $75.0 million interest-free note that matures in full on january 3, 2018. wynn las vegas, llc transferred all interests as lessor in third-party retail store leases to the retail joint venture as part of the transaction and the majority of the retail stores previously operated by wynn las vegas, llc are now operated under a master lease agreement between a newly formed retail entity owned by wynn resorts, as lessee, and the retail joint venture, as lessor. we maintain a 50.1% ownership interest in the retail joint venture and are the managing member. our responsibilities with respect to the retail joint venture include day-to-day business operations, property management services and a role in the leasing decisions of the retail space.

we assessed our ownership in the retail joint venture based on consolidation accounting guidance with an evaluation being performed to determine if the retail joint venture is a variable interest entity ("vie"), if we have a variable interest in the retail joint venture and if we are the primary beneficiary of the retail joint venture. the primary beneficiary is the party who has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and who has an obligation to absorb losses of the entity or a right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity.
we concluded that the retail joint venture is a vie and we are the primary beneficiary based on our involvement in the leasing activities of the retail joint venture. as a result, we consolidate all of the retail joint venture's assets, liabilities and results of operations. we will evaluate our primary beneficiary designation on an ongoing basis and will assess the appropriateness of the retail joint venture's vie status when changes occur.
investments and fair value we have made investments in domestic and foreign corporate debt securities and commercial paper. our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. our investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive income (loss). adjustments are made for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method. such amortization is included in interest income together with realized gains and losses and the stated interest on such securities.
we measure certain of our financial assets and liabilities, at fair value on a recurring basis pursuant to accounting standards for fair value measurements. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. these accounting standards establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. these tiers include: level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
we obtain pricing information in determining the fair value of our available-for-sale securities from independent pricing vendors. based on our inquiries, the pricing vendors use various pricing models consistent with what other market participants would use. the assumptions and inputs used by the pricing vendors are derived from market observable sources including: reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark curves, bids, offers and other market-related data. we have not made adjustments to such prices. each quarter, we validate the fair value pricing methodology to determine the fair value consistent with applicable accounting guidance and to confirm that the securities are classified properly in the fair value hierarchy. we also compare the pricing received from our vendors to independent sources for the same or similar securities.
allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable a substantial portion of our outstanding receivables relates to casino credit play. credit play, through the issuance of markers, represents a significant portion of the table games volume at our las vegas operations. while offered, the issuance of credit at our macau operations is less significant when compared to las vegas. our goal is to maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their balances in a timely fashion. these collection efforts may include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies, and litigation. markers issued at our las vegas operations are generally legally enforceable instruments in the united states, and united states assets of foreign customers may be used to satisfy judgments entered in the united states.
the enforceability of markers and other forms of credit related to gaming debt outside of the united states varies from country to country. some foreign countries do not recognize the enforceability of gaming related debt, or make enforcement burdensome. we closely consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when issuing credit to customers who are not residents of the united states. in addition to our internal credit and collection departments, located in both las vegas and macau, we have a network of legal, accounting and collection professionals to assist us in our determinations regarding enforceability and our overall collection efforts.
as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, 88.1% and 85.1%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily in asia. in addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of markers given to foreign customers is affected by a number of factors including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.

we regularly evaluate our reserve for bad debts based on a specific review of customer accounts and outstanding gaming promoter accounts as well as management's prior experience with collection trends in the casino industry and current economic and business conditions. in determining our allowance for estimated doubtful accounts receivable, we apply loss factors based on historical marker collection history to aged account balances and we specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over a specified dollar amount, based upon the age, the customer's financial condition, collection history and any other known information.
the following table presents key statistics related to our casino accounts receivable (dollars in thousands):
december 31,
2016                                                                                       2015
casino accounts receivable                                   $211,557              $190,294
allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable             $53,860               $66,109
allowance as a percentage of casino accounts receivable          25.5   %              34.7   %
our reserve for doubtful casino accounts receivable is based on our estimates of amounts collectible and depends on the risk assessments and judgments by management regarding realizability, the state of the economy and our credit policy. our reserve methodology is applied similarly to credit extended at each of our resorts. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, 49.2% and 38.7%, respectively, of our outstanding casino accounts receivable balance originated at our macau operations.
as of december 31, 2016, a 100 basis point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change the provision for doubtful accounts by approximately $2.1 million.
as our customer payment experience evolves, we will continue to refine our estimated reserve for bad debts. accordingly, the associated provision for doubtful accounts may fluctuate. because individual customer account balances can be significant, the reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods as we become aware of additional information about a customer or changes occur in a region's economy or legal system.
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts, are used to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures. the fair value of derivative financial instruments is recognized as an asset or liability at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value affecting net income as the company's derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
we seek to manage our interest rate risk associated with variable-rate borrowings, through balancing fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings with the use of interest rate swaps. we currently have three interest rate swap agreements that convert a portion of our variable rate borrowings under the wynn macau senior term loan facility to a fixed rate. under the agreements, we pay a fixed interest rate on notional amounts corresponding to borrowings in exchange for receipts on the same amount at a variable interest rate based on the applicable libor or hibor at the time of payment.
we measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps on a recurring basis. we categorize our interest rate swap contracts as level 2 in the hierarchy as described above. the fair value approximates the amount we would receive (pay) if these contracts were settled at the respective valuation dates. fair value is estimated based upon current, and predictions of future, interest rate levels along a yield curve, the remaining duration of the instruments and other market conditions, and therefore is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods. we adjust this amount by applying a non-performance valuation, considering our creditworthiness or the creditworthiness of our counterparties at each settlement date, as applicable.
stock-based compensation accounting standards for stock-based payments establish standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity's equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. it requires an entity to measure the costs of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognize that cost over the service period. we use the black-scholes option pricing model to determine the grant-date fair value of our stock options. the black-scholes model uses assumptions of expected volatility,
58
risk-free interest rates, the expected term of options granted, and expected rates of dividends. management determines these assumptions by reviewing current market rates, making industry comparisons and reviewing conditions relevant to our company.
the expected volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly impact the fair value of stock options. we believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop our assumptions are reasonable in calculating the fair value of the options we grant. we estimate the expected stock price volatility using a combination of implied and historical factors related to our stock price in accordance with applicable accounting standards. as our stock price fluctuates, this estimate will change. a hypothetical 10% change in the volatility assumption for our options granted in 2016 would not have a material effect on the change in fair value. expected term represents the estimated average time between the option's grant date and its exercise date. a hypothetical 10% change in the expected term assumption for our options granted in 2016 would not have a material effect on the change in fair value. these assumed changes in fair value would have been recognized over the vesting schedule of such awards.
accounting standards also require the classification of stock compensation expense in the same financial statement line items as cash compensation, and therefore impacts our departmental expenses (and related operating margins), pre-opening costs and construction in progress for our development projects, and our general and administrative expenses (including corporate expenses).
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. accounting standards require the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of a change in tax rates on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. accounting standards require recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.
as of december 31, 2016, we have a foreign tax credit ("ftc") carryover of $3.27 billion and we have recorded a valuation allowance of $3.20 billion against this asset based on our estimate of future realization. the ftcs are attributable to the macau special gaming tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in macau. the u.s. taxing regime only allows a credit for 35% of foreign source income. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we rely solely on the reversal of net taxable temporary differences that result in foreign source income during the 10-year foreign tax credit carryforward period.
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on accounting standards for uncertain income taxes. the accounting standards prescribe a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements.
uncertain tax position accounting standards apply to all tax positions related to income taxes. these accounting standards utilize a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
as applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.

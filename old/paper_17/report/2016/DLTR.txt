item 1a. risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. any failure to meet market expectations, including our comparable store sales growth rate, earnings and earnings per share or new store openings, could cause the market price of our stock to decline. you should carefully consider the specific risk factors listed below together with all other information included or incorporated in this report. any of the following risks may materialize, and additional risks not known to us, or that we now deem immaterial, may arise. in such event, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected.
our profitability is vulnerable to cost increases.
future increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise, wage and benefit costs, taxes, duties, merchandise loss (due to theft, damage, or errors), shipping rates, freight costs, fuel costs and store occupancy costs would reduce our profitability. for example, a proposal in congress called the border-adjustment tax would disallow the tax deduction for imported merchandise and interest. in the last fiscal year, our direct imports were $6,267.3 million at retail and our interest expense was $378.8 million. even if the corporate tax rate were reduced, this change would increase our federal income tax and reduce our profits substantially. the minimum wage has increased in certain states and local jurisdictions and is scheduled to increase in other states and local jurisdictions. there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage. the department of labor also issued regulations last year that would have resulted in fewer of our associates being exempt from overtime pay requirements which would have increased our wage costs, but such rules are currently enjoined.
in our dollar tree segment, we do not raise the sales price of our merchandise to offset cost increases because we are committed to selling primarily at the $1.00 price point to continue to provide value to the customer. we are dependent on our ability to adjust our product assortment, to operate more efficiently or to increase our comparable store net sales in order to offset inflation or other cost increases. we can give no assurance that we will be able to operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future. although family dollar, unlike dollar tree, can raise the price of merchandise, customers would buy fewer products if prices were to increase. please see "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" beginning on page 27 of this form 10-k for further discussion of the effect of inflation and other economic factors on our operations.
risks associated with our domestic and foreign suppliers, including, among others, increased taxes, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on trade, could adversely affect our financial performance.
we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments due to financial or other difficulties, we could experience merchandise shortages which could lead to lost sales or increased merchandise costs if alternative sources must be used.
we rely on the availability of imported goods at favorable wholesale prices. merchandise imported directly accounts for approximately 41% to 43% of our dollar tree segment's total retail value purchases and 15% to 17% of our family dollar segment's total retail value purchases. in addition, we believe that a significant portion of our goods purchased from domestic vendors is imported. china is the source of a substantial majority of our imports. imported goods are generally less expensive than domestic goods and increase our profit margins. a disruption in the flow of our imported merchandise, an increase in the cost of those goods or an inability to deduct the cost of such goods for tax purposes may significantly decrease our profits. risks associated with our reliance on imported goods may include disruptions in the flow of or increases in the cost of imported goods because of factors such as:
•an increase in duties, tariffs or other restrictions on trade;
•the implementation of the border-adjustment tax;
•raw material shortages, work stoppages, strikes and political unrest;
•economic crises and international disputes or conflicts;
•changes in currency exchange rates or policies and local economic conditions, including inflation in the country of origin; and
•failure of the united states to maintain normal trade relations with china and other countries.

integrating family dollar's operations with ours may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized.
the success of the family dollar acquisition (the "acquisition"), including anticipated benefits, synergies and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses and cultures of the family dollar segment into our company. it is possible that the integration process will take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs (including costs incurred with respect to the divested stores and related services), ongoing diversion of management attention, increased competition, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees. if we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.
in connection with the acquisition, we were required to divest 330 stores and partially support those stores through a transition services agreement. we are continuing to provide certain transition services to the buyer of the divested stores with respect to which the buyer may owe us approximately $40 million at any time. under the transition services agreement, the buyer must reimburse us for those services in the future. we can give no assurances that we will be able to collect those amounts.
a downturn in economic conditions could impact our sales.
deterioration in economic conditions, such as those caused by a recession, inflation, higher unemployment, consumer debt levels, trade disputes or international conflict, as well as adverse weather conditions or terrorism, could reduce consumer spending or cause customers to shift their spending to products we either do not sell or do not sell as profitably. adverse economic conditions could disrupt consumer spending and significantly reduce our sales, decrease our inventory turnover, cause greater markdowns or reduce our profitability due to lower margins.
a significant disruption in our computer and technology systems could adversely affect our results of operation or business.
we rely extensively on our computer and technology systems to manage inventory, process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results. systems may be subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, security breaches and catastrophic events. if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity, which could adversely affect our results of operation or business.
if we are unable to secure our customers' credit card and confidential information, or other private data relating to our associates, suppliers or our business, we could be subject to negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation, which could damage our business reputation and adversely affect our results of operation or business.
we have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers' debit and credit card information, our associates' private data, suppliers' data, and our business records and intellectual property. despite these measures, criminals are constantly devising schemes to circumvent safeguards and we may be vulnerable to, and unable to detect and appropriately respond to, data security breaches and data loss, including cyber-security attacks. other sophisticated retailers have recently suffered serious security breaches. if we experience a data security breach, we could be exposed to negative publicity, government enforcement actions, private litigation, or costly response measures. in addition, our reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected, which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether. this could have an adverse effect on our results of operation or business.
our growth is dependent on our ability to increase sales in existing stores and to expand our square footage profitably.
existing store sales growth is critical to good operating results and is dependent on a variety of factors including merchandise quality, relevance and availability, store operations and customer satisfaction. in addition, increased competition could adversely affect our sales. our highest sales periods are during the christmas and easter seasons, and we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. in anticipation, we stock extra inventory and hire many temporary employees to prepare our stores. a reduction in sales during these periods could adversely affect our operating results, particularly operating and net income, to a greater extent than if a reduction occurred at other times of the year. untimely merchandise delays due to receiving or distribution problems could have a similar effect. when easter is observed earlier in the year, the selling season is shorter and, as a result, our sales could be adversely affected. easter was observed on april 5, 2015 and march 27, 2016, and will be observed on april 16, 2017.
expanding our square footage profitably depends on a number of uncertainties, including our ability to locate, lease, build out and open or expand stores in suitable locations on a timely basis under favorable economic terms. obtaining an increasing
13
number of profitable stores is an ever increasing challenge. in addition, our expansion is dependent upon third-party developers' abilities to acquire land, obtain financing, and secure necessary permits and approvals. it remains difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects due to the recent turmoil in the financial markets. we also open or expand stores within our established geographic markets, where new or expanded stores may draw sales away from our existing stores. we may not manage our expansion effectively, and our failure to achieve our expansion plans could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we could encounter disruptions in our distribution network or additional costs in distributing merchandise.
our success is dependent on our ability to transport merchandise to our distribution centers and then ship it to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner. we also rely on third parties to deliver certain merchandise directly from vendors to our stores. we may not anticipate, respond to or control all of the challenges of operating our receiving and distribution systems. additionally, if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales or increased costs. some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on our distribution network or costs are:
•shipping disruption. our oceanic shipping schedules may be disrupted or delayed from time to time.
•   shipping costs. we could experience increases in shipping rates imposed by the trans-pacific ocean carriers. changes in import duties, import quotas and other trade sanctions could increase our costs.
•efficient operations. distribution centers and other aspects of our distribution network are difficult to operate efficiently and we could experience a reduction in operating efficiency.
•diesel fuel costs. we have experienced volatility in diesel fuel costs over the past few years.
•vulnerability to natural or man-made disasters. a fire, explosion or natural disaster at a port or any of our distribution facilities could result in a loss of merchandise and impair our ability to adequately stock our stores. some facilities are vulnerable to earthquakes, hurricanes or tornadoes.
•labor disagreement. labor disagreements, disruptions or strikes may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers or stores and increase costs.
•war, terrorism and other events. war and acts of terrorism in the united states, the middle east, or in china or other parts of asia, where we buy a significant amount of our imported merchandise, could disrupt our supply chain or increase our transportation costs.
•economic conditions. suppliers may encounter financial or other difficulties.
our profitability is affected by the mix of products we sell.
our gross profit margin could decrease if we increase the proportion of higher cost goods we sell in the future. imported merchandise is generally lower cost than domestic goods. if the proposed border-adjustment tax or a possible increase in duties increases the cost of imported goods, we may sell less imported goods and our profitability may suffer. in recent years, the percentage of our sales from higher cost consumable products has increased and we can give no assurance that this trend will not continue. as a result, our gross profit margin could decrease unless we are able to maintain our current merchandise cost sufficiently to offset any decrease in our product margin percentage. we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so.
in our family dollar segment, our success also depends on our ability to select and obtain sufficient quantities of relevant merchandise at prices that allow us to sell such merchandise at profitable and appropriate prices. a sales price that is too high causes products to be less attractive to our customers and our sales at family dollar could suffer. we are continuing to implement our everyday low price strategy at family dollar to drive customer loyalty and have a strategic pricing team to improve our value and to increase profitability. inability to successfully implement our pricing strategies at family dollar could have a negative effect on our business.
in addition, our family dollar segment has a substantial number of private brand items and the number of items has been increasing. we believe our success in maintaining broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors, including our pricing, costs, quality and customer perception. we may not achieve or maintain our expected sales for our private brands and, as a result, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. additionally, the increased number of private brands could negatively impact our existing relationships with our non-private brand suppliers.
14
pressure from competitors may reduce our sales and profits.
the retail industry is highly competitive. the marketplace is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of store formats and merchandising strategies. we expect competition to increase in the future. there are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector. some of our current or potential competitors have greater financial resources than we do. we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. please see "item 1. business" beginning on page 6 of this form 10-k for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations.
litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving employees, consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies, or others through private actions, class actions, governmental investigations, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. our products could also cause illness or injury, harm our reputation, and subject us to litigation. for example, we are currently defendants in national and state employment-related class and collective actions and litigation concerning injury from products. the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify. plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. in addition, certain of these matters, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. the cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings may be significant. there also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation, including litigation related to product or food safety, customer information and environmental or safety requirements, which could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.
for a discussion of current legal matters, please see "item 3. legal proceedings" beginning on page 22 of this form 10-k and "note 5 - commitments and contingencies" under the caption "contingencies" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 64 of this form 10-k. resolution of these matters, if decided against the company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, accrued liabilities or cash flows.
changes in federal, state or local law, or our failure to comply with such laws, could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks.
our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations. for example, the proposed border-adjustment tax would increase our federal income tax and reduce our profits substantially. also, the department of labor enacted changes to overtime regulations that were scheduled to take effect on december 1, 2016 and would have required store managers and certain other associates to be paid no less than a specified salary in order to be exempt from the overtime requirements. on november 22, 2016, a federal court judge in texas issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the department of labor from implementing and enforcing these regulations on a national basis. although it is unclear what long-term impact this injunction will have, we may be negatively impacted if any surviving regulations result in fewer of our associates being exempt from overtime pay requirements. the minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that congress will increase the federal minimum wage. significant legislative changes in regulations such as the health-care legislation, that impact our relationship with our workforce could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. changes in other regulatory areas, such as consumer credit, privacy and information security, product and food safety, worker safety or environmental protection, among others, could cause our expenses to increase or product recalls. in addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, particularly wage and hour laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations. changes in tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate.
our business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel.
our growth and performance is dependent on the skills, experience and contributions of our associates, executives and key personnel. various factors, including our recent merger, overall labor availability, wage rates, regulatory or legislative impacts, and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices.
15
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder's best interest.
our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his best interest. these provisions, among other things:
•provide that only the board of directors, chairman or president may call special meetings of the shareholders;
•establish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders' meetings; and
•permit the board of directors, without further action of the shareholders, to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of the common stock.
however, we believe that these provisions allow our board of directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders.
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures.
in connection with the acquisition, we substantially increased our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position. as of january 28, 2017, our total indebtedness is $6,391.8 million. in addition, we have $1,250.0 million of additional borrowing availability under our tranche a revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling $160.7 million.
our high level of debt could have significant consequences, including the following:
•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;
•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments, instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;
•limiting our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;
•imposing restrictive covenants on our operations;
•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt; and
•making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures.
in addition, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.
our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. we may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to fund our day-to-day operations or to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and other cash requirements, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. we may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. the agreements that govern our indebtedness restrict (a) our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any such dispositions and (b) our ability to raise debt capital to be used to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due. we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.
16
our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations.
if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, holders of the notes (and lenders under any of our existing and future indebtedness) could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing such borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, in each case, which could result in your losing your investment.
the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies, and could adversely affect our capital resources, financial condition and liquidity.
the agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to:
•incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;
•declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to, or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value, equity interests;
•make principal payments on, or redeem or repurchase, subordinated debt;
•make loans, advances or other investments;
•incur liens;
•sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;
•enter into sale and lease-back transactions;
•consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person; and
•enter into transactions with affiliates.
in addition, certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them.
a breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates. such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected. in addition, an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders under our credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such credit facilities. furthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit facilities, those lenders may be able to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. in the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.
as a result of these restrictions, we may be:
•limited in how we conduct our business;
•unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or
•unable to compete effectively, take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans.
17
our variable-rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.
certain of our indebtedness, including borrowings under our tranche a revolving credit facility, is subject to variable rates of interest and exposes us to interest rate risk. interest rates, while historically low, have recently begun to increase. when interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income decreases. an increase (decrease) of 1.0% on the interest rate would result in an increase (decrease) of $21.8 million in annual interest expense. although we may enter into interest rate swaps, involving the exchange of floating- for fixed-rate interest payments, to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot assure you we will be able to do so.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in management's discussion and analysis, we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for our company, including:
•   what factors affect our business;
•   what our net sales, earnings, gross margins and costs were in 2016, 2015 and 2014;
•   why those net sales, earnings, gross margins and costs were different from the year before;
•   how all of this affects our overall financial condition;
•   what our expenditures for capital projects were in 2016 and 2015 and what we expect them to be in 2017; and
•   where funds will come from to pay for future expenditures.
as you read management's discussion and analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements, included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k, which present the results of operations for the fiscal years ended january 28, 2017, january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015. in management's discussion and analysis, we analyze and explain the annual changes in some specific line items in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 and for fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. we also provide information regarding the performance of each of our operating segments. unless otherwise indicated, references to "we," "our" or "us" refer to dollar tree, inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
key events and recent developments several key events have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations. they are listed below:
•   in january 2015, we completed a 270,000 square foot expansion of our distribution center in joliet, illinois. the joliet distribution center is now a 1,470,000 square foot, fully automated facility.
•   on february 23, 2015, we completed the offering of $3.25 billion of acquisition notes which we used in connection with our financing of the acquisition of family dollar stores, inc. ("family dollar") (the "acquisition").
•   on march 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement and term loan facilities and received $3.95 billion under the term loan b which we used in connection with our financing of the acquisition.
•   on june 11, 2015, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to refinance the existing $3.95 billion term loan b tranche with $3.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of floating-rate term loan b-1 and $650.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate term loan b-2.
•   on july 6, 2015, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our senior notes issued in 2013.
•   on july 6, 2015 (the "acquisition date"), we completed our acquisition of family dollar.
•   in may 2016, we completed construction of a new 1.5 million square foot distribution center in cherokee county, south carolina.
•   in august 2016, we completed a 0.3 million square foot expansion of our distribution center in stockton, california. the stockton distribution center is now an 854,000 square foot, fully automated facility.
•   on august 4, 2016, we announced the elimination of 370 positions, including 100 vacant positions, at our family dollar store support center in matthews, north carolina. the eliminations were part of the establishment of shared services and our ongoing efforts to achieve $300 million in combined run rate annual synergies by the end of the third year following the july 2015 acquisition.
•   on august 30, 2016, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to reduce the applicable interest rate margin of the term loan a tranche and our new revolving credit facility.
•   on september 22, 2016, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to provide for the incurrence of $1,275.0 million in aggregate principal amount of additional loans under the term loan a-1 tranche
27
and $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of term loan b-3. in addition, we used $242.0 million of cash on hand to prepay the remainder of the term loan b-1.
•   on january 20, 2017, we prepaid the $748.1 million remaining outstanding under the term loan b-3.
overview we are a leading operator of more than 14,300 discount retail stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments. our dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. our family dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores.
our net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. first is our success at opening new stores or adding new stores through mergers or acquisitions. second is the performance of stores once they are open. sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. we refer to this change as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. we include sales from stores expanded during the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. the term 'expanded' also includes stores that are relocated. our acquired family dollar stores are included in the comparable store net sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; however, they will not be included in the annual comparable store net sales calculation until fiscal 2017. stores that have been rebannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new banner.
at january 28, 2017, we operated stores in 48 states and the district of columbia, as well as stores in five canadian provinces. a breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016, respectively, are as follows (family dollar's beginning amounts for the year ended january 30, 2016 are as of the july 6, 2015 acquisition date):

stores are included as rebanners when they close or open, respectively. comparable store net sales for dollar tree may be negatively affected when a family dollar store is rebannered near an existing dollar tree store.

the average size of stores opened in 2016 was approximately 8,100 selling square feet (or about 10,100 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and 7,100 selling square feet (or about 8,300 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment. for 2017, we continue to plan to open stores that are approximately 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 - 12,000 gross square feet) for the dollar tree segment and approximately 6,000 - 8,000 selling square feet (or about 7,000 - 9,000 gross square feet) for the family dollar segment. we believe that these size stores are our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer, buy more and make return visits, which increases our customer traffic.
fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 which ended on january 28, 2017, january 30, 2016 and january 31, 2015, respectively, each included 52 weeks.
in fiscal 2016, comparable store net sales increased by 1.8%. the comparable store net sales increase was the result of a 0.7% increase in the number of transactions and a 1.1% increase in average ticket. we believe comparable store net sales continued to be positively affected by a number of our dollar tree initiatives, as debit and credit card penetration continued to increase in 2016, and we continued the rollout of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our dollar tree stores. at january 28, 2017, the dollar tree segment had frozen and refrigerated merchandise in approximately 4,785 stores, which includes rebannered stores, compared to approximately 4,285 stores at january 30, 2016. we believe that the addition of frozen and refrigerated product enables us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers. in addition, the dollar tree segment accepts food stamps (under the supplemental nutrition assistance program ("snap")) in approximately 6,055 qualified stores compared to approximately 5,600 stores at the end of 2015.
our point-of-sale technology provides us with valuable sales and inventory information to assist our buyers and improve our merchandise allocation to our stores. we believe that this has enabled us to better manage our inventory flow in our stores resulting in more efficient distribution and store operations.
we previously announced that we would rebanner our deals stores in 2015 and 2016. the majority of the deals stores were rebannered as dollar tree stores and the remaining stores were rebannered as family dollar stores. in 2016 and 2015, 167 and 52 stores were rebannered and we recorded $15.5 million in expenses, in connection with the rebannering in fiscal 2015.
the department of labor, under the fair labor standards act, enacted changes to overtime regulations that were scheduled to take effect on december 1, 2016. the changes require store managers and certain other associates to be paid no less than a specified salary in order to be exempt from the overtime requirements. on november 22, 2016, a federal court judge in texas issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the department of labor from implementing and enforcing these regulations on a national basis. as a result of the preliminary injunction, we postponed our response to these regulations. it is unclear what long-term impact this injunction will have on overtime regulations. once this matter is resolved, we will analyze our alternatives to address the overtime regulations under the fair labor standards act.
we must continue to control our merchandise costs, inventory levels and our general and administrative expenses as increases in these items could negatively impact our operating results.
acquisition and divestiture on july 27, 2014, we executed an agreement and plan of merger to acquire family dollar in a cash and stock transaction. on july 6, 2015 we completed the acquisition and family dollar became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary. under the acquisition, the family dollar shareholders received $59.60 in cash and 0.2484 shares of our common stock for each share of family dollar common stock they owned, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares (the "merger consideration").
as of the acquisition date, each outstanding performance share right of family dollar common stock was canceled in exchange for the right of the holder to receive the merger consideration (the "psr payment"). the aggregate amount we paid for the merger consideration and psr payment was $6.8 billion in cash and we issued 28.5 million shares of our common stock, valued at $2.3 billion based on the closing price of our common stock on july 2, 2015.
for a complete description of the acquisition refer to our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on july 8, 2015.
we incurred $39.2 million and $28.5 million in acquisition-related expenses in 2015 and 2014, respectively, excluding acquisition-related interest expense. we also expended approximately $165.7 million in capitalizable debt-issuance costs related to the financing of the acquisition and $78.8 million and $129.8 million of debt-issuance costs was included as a reduction in "long-term debt, net, excluding current portion" at january 28, 2017 and january 30, 2016, respectively.
we expect to achieve approximately $300 million in annual cost savings synergies by the end of the third year after closing, and we will incur $300 million in one-time costs to achieve these synergies.
29
in 2015, we completed the offering of $3.25 billion of senior notes and entered into a credit facility and term loan providing for $6.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities. see "liquidity and capital resources" for a further discussion of these transactions.
in connection with the acquisition, we divested 330 family dollar stores to settle federal trade commission charges that the acquisition would be anticompetitive in certain local markets. the 330 family dollar stores, 325 of which were open at the time of the divestiture, represent approximately $45.5 million of annual operating income. in accordance with purchase accounting, the net effect of the divestiture on our assets and liabilities is fully reflected in the table summarizing the estimates of fair value set forth in "note 2 - acquisition" and the consolidated balance sheet of dollar tree, inc. as of january 30, 2016 included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k. we are continuing to provide certain transition services to the buyer with respect to which the buyer may owe us approximately $40 million at any time. under the transition services agreement, the buyer must reimburse us for those services in the future.

fiscal year ended january 28, 2017 compared to fiscal year ended january 30, 2016
net sales. net sales increased 33.7%, or $5,220.8 million, in 2016 compared to 2015, resulting from $4,418.5 million of incremental net sales from family dollar due to 22 additional weeks of operations in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, sales in the dollar tree segment's new stores and increased comparable store sales partially offset by the loss of sales in the 325 stores which were divested on november 1, 2015 in satisfaction of a federal trade commission requirement in connection with the family dollar acquisition. comparable store sales increased 1.8% on a constant currency basis. constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. we calculated the constant currency basis increase by translating the current year's comparable store sales in canada using the prior year's currency exchange rates. we believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store sales performance. including the impact of currency, comparable store net sales also increased 1.8% due to an increase in average ticket as well as customer count. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, rebanner stores or expand stores near existing stores.
gross profit. gross profit increased by $1,738.0 million or 37.3%, to $6,394.7 million in 2016 compared to $4,656.7 million in 2015. the dollar increase in gross profit was primarily driven by $1,402.6 million of incremental gross profit for family dollar, due to an additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015, as well as higher sales for dollar tree partially offset by the loss of gross profit from the 325 stores which were divested on november 1, 2015. gross profit margin increased to 30.8% in 2016 from 30.1% in 2015 as a result of the prior year including $73.0 million of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and $70.2 million in amortization expense for family dollar related to the stepped-up inventory which was sold during the 52 weeks ended january 30, 2016. in addition, the current year gross profit margin reflects lower merchandise cost due to higher initial mark-on and favorable freight costs. our gross profit margin in the current year included an additional 22 weeks of family dollar's operations which have a lower-margin product mix. this negatively impacted the current year's results in relation to the prior year's results.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased to $4,689.9 million from $3,607.0 million in 2015, an increase of $1,082.9 million or 30.0%. the increase was primarily due to an incremental $972.3 million of expense for family dollar due to the 22 additional weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from the divestiture of 325 stores on november 1, 2015. as
30
a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 22.6% in 2016 from 23.3% in 2015. in 2015, we incurred $39.1 million or 25 basis points of acquisition expenses. excluding acquisition expenses, the selling, general and administrative rate for 2016 as a percentage of sales decreased 40 basis points to 22.6% from 23.0% as a result of lower payroll-related costs and depreciation as a percentage of net sales and lower professional fees and legal fees partially offset by higher store repairs and maintenance as a percentage of net sales.
operating income. operating income for 2016 increased to $1,704.8 million compared with $1,049.7 million in 2015. operating income margin increased to 8.2% in 2016 from 6.8% in 2015. the increase in operating income is the result of an incremental $430.3 million of operating income in the family dollar segment, due to the additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015 and a $224.8 million increase in operating income in the dollar tree segment partially offset by the loss of operating income from the 325 stores which were divested on november 1, 2015. in the prior year, the family dollar segment incurred an operating loss of $30.8 million as a result of unusually high markdowns related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and the amortization of stepped-up inventory that was sold during the period.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net was $375.5 million in 2016 compared to $599.4 million in 2015. the variance is due to the following:
•   an $89.5 million breakage fee related to the prepayment of the senior notes in 2015;
•   a $39.5 million prepayment fee, a $17.4 million write-off of the original issuance discount and a $5.9 million write-off of deferred financing costs related to the term loan b refinancing in 2015;
•   a $1.0 billion prepayment of term loan b-1 principal in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in the accelerated expensing of $19.0 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs in 2015 and lower interest expense in 2016.
•   an additional $242.0 million prepayment of term loan b-1 in the third quarter of 2016 which resulted in lower interest expense in 2016.
•   the term loans were refinanced in the third quarter of 2016 which resulted in lower interest rates and the accelerated expensing of $26.6 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs and $2.6 million in fees.
•   a $748.1 million prepayment of the remaining principal for term loan b-3 in the fourth quarter of 2016, which resulted in the accelerated expensing of $11.7 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs.
income taxes. our effective tax rate in 2016 was 32.6% compared to 37.0% in 2015. the decrease in the tax rate is primarily the result of a one-time election allowing the family dollar acquisition to be treated as an asset purchase for certain state tax purposes, a 1.0% decrease in north carolina's state tax rate which resulted in a reduction in the deferred tax liability related to the trade name intangible asset and the adoption of asu no. 2016-09 under which the incremental tax benefit recognized upon rsu vestings and stock option exercises is recorded in income tax expense.
fiscal year ended january 30, 2016 compared to fiscal year ended january 31, 2015
net sales. net sales increased 80.2%, or $6,896.2 million, in 2015 compared to 2014, resulting from $6,162.0 million of net sales from family dollar since the acquisition date, sales in the dollar tree segment's new stores and increased comparable store net sales. comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and, to a lesser extent, are negatively affected when we open new stores, rebanner stores or expand stores near existing ones.
gross profit. gross profit increased by $1,622.7 million, or 53.5%, to $4,656.7 million in 2015 compared to $3,034.0 million in 2014. the dollar increase in gross profit was primarily driven by $1,407.4 million of gross profit for family dollar as well as higher sales for dollar tree. our gross profit margin is negatively impacted by the overall lower-margin product mix for the family dollar segment. included in family dollar's cost of sales is $73.0 million of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and $70.2 million for amortization of the stepped-up inventory value for inventory which was sold during 2015.
selling, general and administrative expenses. selling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 increased to $3,607.0 million from $1,993.8 million in 2014, an increase of $1,613.2 million or 80.9%. the increase was primarily due to $1,438.2 million of expense for family dollar. as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 23.3% for 2015 compared to 23.2% for 2014. in 2015, we incurred $39.1 million or 25 basis points of expenses related to the acquisition compared to $28.5 million or 35 basis points in 2014. excluding acquisition expenses, the selling, general and administrative rate increased to 23.0% in 2015 compared to 22.8% in 2014. the increase is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization as
31
a percentage of net sales resulting from the recording of favorable lease rights and fixed assets at their fair values in connection with the acquisition.
operating income. operating income for 2015 increased to $1,049.7 million compared with $1,040.2 million in 2014, an increase of $9.5 million or 0.9%. operating income margin decreased from 12.1% in 2014 to 6.8% in 2015. the increase in operating income was due to a $40.3 million increase in the dollar tree segment partially offset by a $30.8 million operating loss in the family dollar segment. the decrease in operating income margin is a result of the family dollar segment operating loss due to unusually high markdowns related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and the amortization of stepped-up inventory sold in 2015 as well as higher depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales resulting from the recording of favorable lease rights and fixed assets at their fair values in connection with the acquisition.
interest expense, net. interest expense, net was $599.4 million in 2015 compared to $80.1 million in 2014 due to the following:
•   a $161.9 million increase in interest for debt issued in conjunction with the acquisition compared with interest on the senior notes;
•   an $89.5 million prepayment penalty on retirement of the senior notes;
•   a $39.5 million prepayment penalty for the term loan b refinancing;
•   a $27.3 million write-off of the debt discount and deferred financing costs due to the term loan b refinancing;
•   a $19.0 million write-off of deferred financing costs due to a $1.0 billion prepayment of the term loan b-1; and
•   a $12.1 million increase in loan commitment fees on the new debt structure.
income taxes. our effective tax rate was 37.0% in 2015 compared to 37.2% in 2014. the rate decrease is due to the utilization of a capital loss to offset the previously recognized gain on our investment in ollie's holdings, inc. and additional work opportunity tax credits partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance.
segment information we operate a chain of more than 14,300 retail discount stores in 48 states and five canadian provinces. our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: dollar tree and family dollar. we define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker ("codm") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.
the dollar tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price of $1.00. the dollar tree segment includes our operations under the "dollar tree" and "dollar tree canada" brands, 11 distribution centers in the united states, two distribution centers in canada and a store support center in chesapeake, virginia.
the family dollar segment operates a chain of general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. the family dollar segment consists of our operations under the "family dollar" brand, 11 distribution centers and a store support center in matthews, north carolina.
we measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales, gross profit and operating income (loss). we may revise the measurement of each segment's operating income (loss), including the allocation of distribution center and store support center costs, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the codm. when the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.

operating income margin for dollar tree decreased to 11.6% in 2015 compared to 12.1% in 2014. excluding acquisition costs of $39.2 million or 40 basis points in 2015 and $28.5 million or 35 basis points in 2014, operating income margin was 12.0% and 12.4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. excluding acquisition costs, the decrease in operating income margin was the result of lower gross profit margin as noted above and higher professional fees related to the family dollar integration partially offset by lower payroll costs as a percentage of net sales due to lower profit sharing contributions.

net sales for family dollar increased $4,418.5 million or 71.7% in 2016 compared to 2015 resulting from 22 additional weeks of operations in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 partially offset by the loss of sales due to the required divestiture of 325 stores and the rebannering of 296 stores from family dollar to dollar tree since the acquisition.
gross profit for family dollar increased $1,402.6 million or 99.7% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015. gross profit, as a percentage of sales, increased to 26.6% in 2016 compared to 22.8% in 2015. the 380 basis point increase in gross profit margin was due to lower merchandise cost due to a decrease in inventory step-up amortization, synergy efforts and lower markdowns. gross profit margin was negatively impacted in 2015 due to $73.0 million
33
of markdown expense related to sku rationalization and planned liquidations and $70.2 million in amortization expense related to stepped-up inventory which was sold in 2015.
operating income for family dollar increased $430.3 million or 1,397.1% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an additional 22 weeks of operations in 2016 compared to 2015. operating income, as a percentage of sales, increased primarily due to improved gross profit margin as noted above.
because the acquisition of family dollar occurred in the fiscal year ended january 30, 2016, comparable information for the family dollar segment for the year ended january 31, 2015 is not available.
liquidity and capital resources our business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand our distribution network and operate and expand our existing stores. our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of september and october. historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities.

net cash provided by operating activities increased $870.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher net income, net of depreciation and amortization, increases in other current liabilities and decreases in other current assets and inventories. these are partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and deferred income tax liabilities.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $140.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to lower net income, net of depreciation and amortization, a decrease in accrued expenditures related to the family dollar acquisition, and an increase in cash used to purchase merchandise inventories offset by an increase in accounts payable.
net cash used in investing activities decreased $6,494.8 million in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of family dollar in 2015.
net cash used in investing activities increased $6,663.4 million in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of family dollar and higher capital expenditures.
in 2016, net cash provided by financing activities decreased $7,109.3 million compared to 2015 primarily due to lower debt proceeds partially offset by lower principal payments compared to the prior year.
in 2015, net cash provided by financing activities increased $6,079.4 million compared to 2014 primarily due to the issuance of the acquisition-related debt partially offset by the repayment of the senior notes and principal payments on the term loans.
at january 28, 2017, our long-term borrowings were $6,391.8 million. we also have $120.0 million, $110.0 million and $100.0 million letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements, under which approximately $194.9 million were committed to letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at january 28, 2017.
in september 2013, we entered into a note purchase agreement ("npa") with institutional accredited investors in which we issued and sold $750.0 million of senior notes (the "notes") in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933. the notes consisted of three tranches: $300.0 million of 4.03% senior notes due september 16, 2020; $350.0 million of 4.63% senior notes due september 16, 2023; and $100.0 million of 4.78% senior notes due september 16, 2025. interest on the notes was payable semi-annually on january 15 and july 15 of each year. the notes were unsecured and ranked pari passu in right of repayment with our other senior unsecured indebtedness. we could prepay some or all of the notes at any time in an amount not less than 5% of the original aggregate principal amount of the notes to be prepaid, at a price equal
34
to the sum of (a) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, and (b) the applicable make-whole amount. in the event of a change in control (as defined in the note purchase agreement), we could have been required to prepay the notes. the note purchase agreement contained customary affirmative and restrictive covenants. we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance share repurchases.
on january 20, 2015, we entered into the first amendment (the " notes amendment") to the note purchase agreement, with a majority of the noteholders party thereto. the notes amendment was entered into in connection with our pending acquisition of family dollar. the notes amendment allowed, among other things, a newly-formed subsidiary of dollar tree to issue debt and hold the proceeds in escrow pending consummation of the acquisition (such debt, the "escrow debt"). pursuant to the terms of the notes amendment, in certain circumstances the amount of interest due on the notes could increase by 1.0% per annum. the notes amendment also contained certain negative covenants and other restrictions applicable during the period in which any escrow debt is outstanding. on the acquisition date, we prepaid the notes outstanding of $750.0 million and paid $89.5 million of a make-whole premium, determined in accordance with the provisions of the dollar tree npa plus additional interest in accordance with the provisions of the first amendment to the dollar tree npa.
in june 2012, we entered into a five-year $750.0 million unsecured credit agreement (the agreement). the agreement provided for a $750.0 million revolving line of credit, including up to $150.0 million in available letters of credit. the interest rate on the agreement was based, at our option, on a libor rate, plus a margin, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin. the agreement also bore a facilities fee, calculated as a percentage, as defined, of the amount available under the line of credit, payable quarterly. the agreement also bore an administrative fee payable annually. the agreement, among other things, required the maintenance of certain specified financial ratios, restricted the payment of certain distributions and prohibited the incurrence of certain new indebtedness.
in september 2013, we amended the agreement to enable the issuance of the notes.
on august 15, 2014, we entered into an amendment (the "credit amendment") to the agreement. the credit amendment further amended the agreement to facilitate the issuance and/or borrowings of certain third-party debt financing to finance the acquisition. the credit amendment also facilitated escrow arrangements related to the acquisition. on the acquisition date, we paid in full all amounts owing under the agreement and terminated all commitments to extend further credit thereunder.
on february 23, 2015, we completed the offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due 2023 (the "2023 notes", and together with the 2020 notes, the "acquisition notes"). the acquisition notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and outside the united states, only to non-u.s. investors pursuant to regulation s under the securities act. we used the proceeds of the acquisition notes to finance in part the acquisition. on august 1, 2016, we completed the exchange of the acquisition notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms. the acquisition notes are fully, unconditionally, jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis, subject to certain exceptions, by each of our subsidiaries which guarantee the obligations under our senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries.
the 2020 notes, which mature on march 1, 2020, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of february 23, 2015, with u.s. bank national association, as trustee (the "2020 notes indenture"). the 2023 notes, which mature on march 1, 2023, were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of february 23, 2015, with u.s. bank national association, as trustee (the "2023 notes indenture", and together with the 2020 notes indenture, the "indentures").
interest on the acquisition notes is due semiannually on march 1 and september 1 of each year and commenced on september 1, 2015. no principal is due on the acquisition notes until their maturity dates.
the indentures contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions: (i) incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to, or purchase or otherwise acquire or retire for value, equity interests; (iii) make any principal payment on, or redeem or repurchase, subordinated debt; (iv) make loans, advances or other investments; (v) incur liens; (vi) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; (vii) consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all assets to, another person; and (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates. the indentures also provide for certain events of default, which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding acquisition notes under the applicable indenture to be declared immediately due and payable.
the restriction in the indentures on our ability to pay dividends is subject to certain significant exceptions, including an exception that permits us to pay dividends and make other distributions regardless of dollar amount so long as, after giving pro forma effect thereto, we would have a consolidated total net leverage ratio, as defined under the indentures, no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. as of january 28, 2017, our consolidated total net leverage ratio, as defined in the indentures, was below 3.50 to 1.00. so
35
long as our consolidated total net leverage ratio remains below 3.50 to 1.00, the indentures do not restrict our ability to pay dividends.
on march 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement, with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, providing for $6.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities (the "new senior secured credit facilities") consisting of a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the "new revolving credit facility") and $4.95 billion of term loan facilities (the "new term loan facilities"). the new term loan facilities consisted of a $1.0 billion term loan a tranche and a $3.95 billion term loan b tranche. the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche mature five years after the acquisition date, unless any of the 2020 notes remain outstanding as of 91 days prior to their stated maturity, in which case the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche will mature at such time. the borrowings under the term loan b tranche mature seven years after the acquisition date.
upon the consummation of the acquisition, we drew the term loans under the term loan a facility and have the ability to borrow under the new revolving credit facility.
the new senior secured credit facilities were not guaranteed by us or any of our subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the acquisition, but upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly-owned u.s. subsidiaries, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "credit agreement guarantors"). upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of dollar tree and the credit agreement guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.
the new senior secured credit facilities contain representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants. these include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends, repay the acquisition notes, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person. in addition, a financial maintenance covenant based on our consolidated first lien secured net leverage ratio will apply to the new revolving credit facility and the term loan a tranche of the new term loan facilities.
the restriction in the new senior secured credit facilities on our ability to pay dividends is subject to certain significant exceptions, including an exception that permits us to pay dividends and make other restricted payments regardless of dollar amount so long as, after giving pro forma effect thereto, we would have a consolidated total net leverage ratio, as defined under the new senior secured credit facilities, no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. as of january 28, 2017, our consolidated total net leverage ratio, as defined in the new senior secured credit facilities, was below 3.50 to 1.00. so long as our consolidated total net leverage ratio remains below 3.50 to 1.00, the new senior secured credit facilities do not restrict our ability to pay dividends.
on june 11, 2015, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to refinance the term loan b tranche with $3.3 billion of floating-rate term loan b-1 and $650.0 million of 4.25% fixed-rate term loan b-2. the term loan b-2 does not require amortization payments prior to maturity.
the new term loan facilities, excluding the term loan b-2, require mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset sales and out of excess cash flow, among other things, and subject in each case to certain significant exceptions. we will pay certain commitment fees in connection with the new revolving credit facility. the term loan b-2 requires us to pay a 2.0% prepayment fee if it is repaid in the second year after the refinance date and a 1.0% prepayment fee if it is repaid in the third year after the refinance date.
on january 26, 2016, we prepaid $1.0 billion of the $3.3 billion term loan b-1.
on august 30, 2016, we entered into an amendment (the "third amendment") to the new senior secured credit facilities. the third amendment reduced the applicable interest rate margin with respect to the term loan a tranche of our new term loan facilities, which had $937.5 million outstanding immediately prior to the date of the third amendment, and our new revolving credit facility, which was undrawn other than letters of credit immediately prior to the date of the third amendment. the reduction in the interest rate margins was accomplished by replacing the existing term loan a tranche with a new term loan a-1 tranche and the new revolving credit facility with new revolving facility commitments (the "tranche a revolving credit facility") that, except as set forth below, have terms identical to the existing term loan a tranche and new revolving credit facility. as a result, the total amount borrowed under the third amendment was unchanged from the total amount borrowed under the new senior secured credit facilities.
loans made under the tranche a revolving credit facility or the term loan a-1 tranche will bear interest at libor plus 1.75% annually (or a base rate plus 0.75%) until we deliver our quarterly compliance certificate to the lenders outlining our secured net leverage ratio for the quarter ended january 28, 2017. prior to that date, we will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the tranche a revolving credit facility of 0.30% annually. after january 28, 2017, loans made under the tranche a revolving
36
credit facility or the term loan a-1 tranche will bear interest at libor plus 1.50% to 2.25% or at a base rate plus 0.50% to 1.25% and we will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the tranche a revolving credit facility ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% (in each case, determined based on our secured net leverage ratio).
beginning on january 13, 2017, loans made under the term loan a-1 tranche require quarterly amortization payments of 1.25% of the original principal amount until april 15, 2017 and 1.875% after april 15, 2017.
the restrictive covenants and events of default in the third amendment are unchanged from the provisions in the new senior secured credit facilities.
on september 22, 2016, we entered into an amendment (the "fourth amendment") to the new senior secured credit facilities. the fourth amendment provided for an additional $1,275.0 million in additional principal amounts under the term loan a-1 tranche and $750.0 million in total principal amount of term loan b-3. the proceeds of the additional loans under the term loan a-1 tranche and the term loan b-3 were used to prepay the $2,025.0 million of existing term loan b-1. in addition, we used $242.0 million of cash on hand to prepay the remainder of the term loan b-1.
the additional loans under the term loan a-1 tranche have terms identical to the term loan a-1 tranche made under the third amendment to the new senior secured credit facilities. the term loan b-3 had terms identical to the term loan b-1 under the new senior secured credit facilities, except as set forth below.
the term loan b-3 bore interest at libor plus 2.50% annually (or a base rate plus 1.50%).
beginning on january 13, 2017, the term loan b-3 required quarterly amortization payments of 0.25% of the original principal amount until maturity.
the obligations and additional loans under the tranche a revolving credit facilities, the term loan a-1 tranche and the term loan b-3 are secured by the same collateral and subject to the same guarantees as the other classes of loans under the new senior secured credit facilities. the restrictive covenants and events of default in the fourth amendment are substantially the same as the provisions in the new senior secured credit facilities.
in connection with the third amendment and fourth amendment to the new senior secured credit facilities, we accelerated the expensing of approximately $26.6 million of amortizable non-cash deferred financing costs and expensed approximately $2.6 million in transaction-related costs.
on january 20, 2017, we prepaid the $748.1 million remaining outstanding under our term loan b-3. the prepayment resulted in an acceleration of the amortization of debt-issuance costs associated with the term loan b-3 of $11.7 million.
annual interest expense is expected to approximate $307.7 million in 2017, $14.2 million of which is non-cash amortization of debt-issuance costs and debt premiums.
historically we have used cash to repurchase shares but we did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. at january 28, 2017, we have $1.0 billion remaining under board repurchase authorization.
funding requirements overview, including off-balance sheet arrangements we expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding existing stores in fiscal 2017 to total approximately $419.8 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs.
at january 28, 2017, we have $1,250.0 million available under our tranche a revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for standby letters of credit totaling $160.7 million.
our estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are between $760.0 million and $780.0 million, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, the addition of freezers and coolers to approximately 400 stores, the start of construction of a new dollar tree banner distribution center and the expansion of our chesapeake, virginia store support center. we believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the next few years from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our tranche a revolving credit facility.

long-term borrowings acquisition notes. in february 2015, we completed the offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due march 1, 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due march 1, 2023 (the "2023 notes", and together with the 2020 notes, the "acquisition notes"). the acquisition notes were offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, as amended (the "securities act"), and outside the united states, only to non-u.s. investors pursuant to regulation s under the securities act. on august 1, 2016, we completed the exchange of the acquisition notes for registered notes with substantially identical terms. the acquisition notes are fully, unconditionally, jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis, subject to certain exceptions, by each of our subsidiaries which guarantee the obligations under our senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries. interest on the acquisition notes is due semiannually on march 1 and september 1 and commenced on september 1, 2015. for complete terms of the acquisition notes please see "note 6 - long-term debt" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 68 of this form 10-k.
credit facility and term loans. on march 9, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement, with jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., as administrative agent, providing for $6.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities (the "new senior secured credit facilities") consisting of a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility (the "new revolving credit facility") and $4.95 billion of term loan facilities (the "new term loan facilities"). the new term loan facilities consisted of a $1.0 billion term loan a tranche and a $3.95 billion term loan b tranche. the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche mature five years after the acquisition date, unless any of the 2020 notes remain outstanding as of 91 days prior to their stated maturity, in which case the new revolving credit facility and the borrowings under the term loan a tranche will mature at such time. the borrowings under the term loan b tranche mature seven years after the acquisition date. upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by certain of our direct or indirect wholly-owned u.s. subsidiaries, including family dollar and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "credit agreement guarantors"). upon and after the acquisition date, the new senior secured credit facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and those of the credit agreement guarantors, subject to certain exceptions.
on june 11, 2015, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to refinance the term loan b tranche with $3.3 billion of floating-rate term loan b-1 and $650.0 million of 4.25% fixed-rate term loan b-2.
38
on january 26, 2016, we prepaid $1.0 billion of the $3.3 billion term loan b-1.
on august 30, 2016, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to refinance the term loan a tranche and the new revolving credit facility by replacing the existing term loan a tranche with a new term loan a-1 tranche and the new revolving credit facility with new revolving facility commitments (the "tranche a revolving credit facility"), reducing the applicable interest rate margins.
on september 22, 2016, we amended the terms of the new senior secured credit facilities to provide for $1,275.0 million in additional principal amounts under the term loan a-1 tranche and $750.0 million in total principal amount of term loan b-3. the proceeds of the additional loans under the term loan a-1 tranche and the term loan b-3 were used to prepay the $2,025.0 million of existing term loan b-1. in addition, we used $242.0 million of cash on hand to prepay the remainder of the term loan b-1.
loans made under the tranche a revolving credit facility or the term loan a-1 tranche will bear interest at libor plus 1.75% annually (or a base rate plus 0.75%) until we deliver our quarterly compliance certificate to the lenders outlining our secured net leverage ratio for the quarter ended january 28, 2017. prior to that date, we will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the tranche a revolving credit facility of 0.30% annually. after january 28, 2017, loans made under the tranche a revolving credit facility or the term loan a-1 tranche will bear interest at libor plus 1.50% to 2.25% or at a base rate plus 0.50% to 1.25% and we will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the tranche a revolving credit facility ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% (in each case, determined based on our secured net leverage ratio). the term loan b-3 bore interest at libor plus 2.50% annually (or a base rate plus 1.50%).
on january 20, 2017, we prepaid the $748.1 million remaining outstanding under our term loan b-3.
for complete terms of the credit facility and term loans please see "note 6 - long-term debt" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 68 of this form 10-k.
secured senior notes. we assumed the liability for $300.0 million of 5.0% senior notes due february 1, 2021 which were issued by family dollar on january 28, 2011 through a public offering. these unsecured notes became secured upon closing of the acquisition. these notes are equally and ratably secured with the term loans.
forgivable promissory note. in 2012, we entered into a promissory note with the state of connecticut under which the state loaned us $7.0 million in connection with our acquisition, construction and installation of land, building, machinery and equipment for our distribution facility in windsor, connecticut. if certain performance targets are met, the loan will be forgiven in fiscal 2018. if the performance targets are not met, the loan and accrued interest must be repaid over a five-year period beginning in fiscal 2018.
interest on long-term borrowings. these amounts represent interest payments on the acquisition notes, term loans, senior secured notes and forgivable promissory note using the interest rates for each at january 28, 2017.
commitments letters of credit and surety bonds. we are a party to three letter of credit reimbursement and security agreements providing $120.0 million, $110.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, for letters of credit. letters of credit are generally issued for the routine purchase of imported merchandise and we had approximately $194.9 million of purchases committed under these letters of credit at january 28, 2017.
we also have approximately $160.7 million of letters of credit outstanding that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and $69.8 million of surety bonds outstanding primarily for certain utility payment obligations at some of our stores and self-insured insurance programs.
technology assets. we have commitments totaling approximately $13.5 million to primarily purchase store technology assets and maintenance for our stores during 2017.
telecommunication contracts. we have contracted for telecommunication services with contracts expiring in 2020. the total amount of these commitments is approximately $104.7 million.

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical.
inventory valuation as discussed in "note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies" under the caption "merchandise inventories" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 52 of this form 10-k, inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. the averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.
we estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. our physical inventory counts are generally taken between january and october of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at january 28, 2017 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2016, including the fourth quarter. we have not experienced significant fluctuations in historical shrink rates beyond approximately 10-20 basis points in our dollar tree segment for the last few years. the amounts recorded in the current year reflect the dollar tree and family dollar segments' historical results. we periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described.
our management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.
in our family dollar segment, we receive vendor support in the form of cash payments or allowances through a variety of reimbursements such as purchase discounts and allowances, cooperative advertising, scan downs and volume or other rebates. we have agreements with vendors setting forth the specific conditions for each allowance or payment. in accordance with asc 605-50, "revenue recognition - customer payments and incentives," depending on the arrangement, we either recognize the allowance as a reduction of current costs or recognize the benefit over the period the related merchandise is sold. if the payment is a reimbursement for costs incurred, it is offset against those related costs; otherwise, it is treated as a reduction to cost of goods sold.
accrued expenses on a monthly basis, we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred. certain expenses, such as legal reserves, require a high degree of judgment and our most material estimates include domestic freight expenses, self-insurance costs, store-level operating expenses, such as property taxes and utilities, and certain other expenses.
we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims. our accruals, if any, related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable. we review outstanding matters with external counsel to assess the probability of an unfavorable outcome and estimates of loss. we re-evaluate outstanding proceedings and claims each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available, and we adjust or establish accruals, if necessary. our legal proceedings are described in "note 5 - commitments and contingencies" under the caption "contingencies" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 64 of this form 10-k.
our freight and store-level operating expenses are estimated based on current activity and historical trends and results. our workers' compensation, general liability and health insurance accruals are recorded based on third-party actuarial valuations which
40
we obtain at least annually. for our workers' compensation and general liability accruals, these actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors. for our health insurance accrual, the actuary provides an estimate based on historical claims and claim payment timing. certain other expenses are estimated and recorded in the periods that management becomes aware of them. the related accruals are adjusted as management's estimates change.
differences in management's estimates and assumptions could result in expenses which are materially different from the calculated accruals. our experience has been that some of our estimates are too high and others are too low. historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
business combinations-purchase price allocation for the family dollar acquisition, we allocated the purchase price to the various tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values, which were finalized during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of fair value for certain complex assets acquired and liabilities assumed. many of the estimates and assumptions used to determine fair values, such as those used for intangible assets are made based on forecasted information and discount rates. in addition, the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. these assets, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. an additional evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.
for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are family dollar, dollar tree and dollar tree canada. goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions. management judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process. the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions. actual values may differ significantly from these judgments, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environments for our reporting units. critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:
•   the potential future cash flows of the reporting unit. the projections use management's estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period, including growth rates in revenue, gross margin and expenses. the cash flows are based on our most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our fiscal 2016 impairment evaluations are reasonable; however, variations in the assumptions and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.
•   selection of an appropriate discount rate. calculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. the discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our family dollar reporting unit. the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our reporting units ranged from 9.0% to 13.5% for our fiscal 2016 analysis.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the family dollar tradename, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. we estimate the fair value of tradename intangible assets based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. this approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. the discount rate is consistent with the discount rate used in our family dollar goodwill impairment evaluation adjusted for revenue-specific growth risk.
our impairment evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014.
41
income taxes on a quarterly basis, we estimate our required income tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. our income taxes payable are estimated based on currently enacted tax rates and estimated state apportionment factors. management assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and management's projections for future taxable income. we cannot guarantee that we will generate taxable income in future years. historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of our tax accrual.
in addition, we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns. judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws, including relevant case law, and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded. we believe that our liability for uncertain tax positions is adequate. for further discussion of our changes in reserves during fiscal 2016, see "note 4 - income taxes" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 61 of this form 10-k.
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales, comparable store net sales, operating income and net income and expect this trend to continue. our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including:
•   shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially easter;
•   the timing of new store openings;
•   the net sales contributed by new stores;
•   changes in our merchandise mix; and
•   competition.
our highest sales periods are the christmas and easter seasons. easter was observed on april 5, 2015 and on march 27, 2016, and will be observed on april 16, 2017. we believe that the later easter in 2017 could result in a $10.0 million increase in sales in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016. we generally realize a disproportionate amount of our net sales and of our operating and net income during the fourth quarter. in anticipation of increased sales activity during these months, we purchase substantial amounts of inventory and hire a significant number of temporary employees to supplement our continuing store staff. our operating results, particularly operating and net income, could suffer if our net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter or during the easter season for any reason, including merchandise delivery delays due to receiving or distribution problems, changes in consumer sentiment or inclement weather.
our unaudited results of operations for the eight most recent quarters are shown in a table in "note 12 - quarterly financial information (unaudited)" in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" beginning on page 88 of this form 10-k.
inflation and other economic factors our ability to provide quality merchandise at a fixed price in our dollar tree stores and on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control. consumer spending could decline because of economic pressures, including unemployment and rising fuel prices. reductions in consumer confidence and spending could have an adverse effect on our sales. national or international events, including war or terrorism, could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries. these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs, fuel costs and other costs that are critical to our operations, such as shipping and wage rates.
shipping costs. trans-pacific shipping rates are negotiated with individual freight lines and are subject to fluctuation based on shipping industry market conditions and fuel costs. we can give no assurances as to the final rate trends for 2017, as we are in the early stages of our negotiations.
wage costs. multiple states and local jurisdictions passed legislation that increased their minimum wages in 2016 and 2017 and the federal government has made indications that it may consider increasing the federal minimum wage. as a result, we believe our expenses will increase except to the extent that we are able to offset our payroll costs with savings in our operations.
the department of labor, under the fair labor standards act, enacted changes to overtime regulations that were scheduled to take effect on december 1, 2016. the changes require store managers and certain other associates to be paid no less than a
42
specified salary in order to be exempt from the overtime requirements. on november 22, 2016, a federal court judge in texas issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocks the department of labor from implementing and enforcing these regulations on a national basis. as a result of the preliminary injunction we postponed our response. it is unclear what long-term impact this injunction will have on overtime regulations. once this matter is resolved, we will analyze our alternatives to address the overtime regulations under the fair labor standards act.
imports. based on possible future legislation, tariffs on imported goods may increase and, under the border-adjustment tax proposal, we may be unable to deduct the cost of imported goods. last year, we paid approximately $93.7 million in tariffs and imported approximately 27.4% of our merchandise.
currency fluctuations. we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our operations in canada.

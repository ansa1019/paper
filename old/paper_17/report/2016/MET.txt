item 1a. risk factors economic environment and capital markets-related risks if difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally persist, they may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in financial asset classes or various markets, including global capital markets, can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. global market factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, derivative prices and availability, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation, all affect our financial condition, as well as the volume, profitability and results of our business operations and our ability to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and meet our obligations at metlife, inc., either directly or by virtue of their impact on the business and economic environment generally and on general levels of economic activity, employment and customer behavior specifically. disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. upheavals in the financial markets can also affect our financial condition (including our liquidity and capital levels) as a result of mismatched impacts on the value of our assets and our liabilities. while our diversified business mix and geographically diverse business operations partially mitigate these risks, correlation across regions, countries and global market factors may reduce the benefits of diversification.
at times throughout the past several years, volatile conditions have characterized financial markets. significant market volatility, and government actions taken in response, may exacerbate some of the risks we face. concerns about the political and/or economic stability in the u.k., italy, mexico, turkey and puerto rico have recently contributed to global market volatility. this market volatility has affected the performance of various asset classes at various times, and it could continue. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments - current environment." events following the u.k.'s referendum on june 23, 2016 and the uncertainties, including foreign currency exchange risks, associated with its potential withdrawal from the eu, have contributed to market volatility, both in the united states and beyond. such events and uncertainties could contribute to weakening gross domestic product ("gdp") growth, primarily in the u.k. and europe. the magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts would depend on the detailed agreements reached by the u.k. and eu as a result of the exit negotiations and negotiations regarding trade and other arrangements. in addition, the impact on global capital markets, the economy and metlife of the transition occurring in the united states government and the priorities of the trump administration is uncertain. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - industry trends - financial and economic environment." any of these factors could have significant adverse effects on the economy and financial markets generally.
41
to the extent these uncertain financial market conditions persist, our revenues, reserves and net investment income, as well as the demand for certain of our products, are likely to remain under pressure. similarly, sustained periods of low interest rates and risk asset returns could reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures such as hedging, causing our profit margins to erode as a result of reduced income from our investment portfolio and increase in insurance liabilities. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - industry trends - impact of a sustained low interest rate environment." also, in the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the global credit crisis, we could incur significant capital and/or operating losses due to, among other reasons, losses incurred in our general account and as a result of the impact on us of guarantees, including increases in liabilities, capital maintenance obligations and/or collateral requirements associated with our affiliated reinsurers and other similar arrangements. even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to sustained periods of low market returns, low levels of u.s. interest rates, and/or heightened market volatility, which may also increase the cost and limit the availability of the hedging instruments and other protective measures we take to mitigate such risk, or increase the cost of our insurance liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the statutory capital and earnings of our insurance subsidiaries, as well as impair our financial strength ratings.
we are a significant writer of variable insurance products and certain other products issued through separate accounts. the account values of these products decrease as a result of declining equity markets. lower interest rates generally increase account values in the near term, but may result in lower returns in fixed income vehicles in the future. decreases in account values reduce certain fees generated by these products, cause the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("dac") to accelerate, could increase the level of insurance liabilities we must carry to support such products issued with any associated guarantees and could require us to provide additional funding to our captive reinsurers.
in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. group insurance, in particular, is affected by higher unemployment rates. in addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of claims, adverse utilization of benefits relative to our best estimate expectations and lapses or surrenders of policies. furthermore, our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. such adverse changes in the economy could negatively affect our earnings and capitalization and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may continue to raise the possibility of legislative, judicial, regulatory and other governmental actions. the trump administration has released a memorandum that generally delayed all pending regulations from publication in the federal register pending their review and approval by a department or agency head appointed or designated by president trump, and has issued an executive order that calls for a comprehensive review of dodd-frank. in addition, the trump administration has discussed potentially putting in place a tax on goods and services imported into the united states and the intention to renegotiate certain international trade agreements with other countries, including the north american free trade agreement ("nafta"). we cannot predict with certainty what other proposals may be made or what legislation or regulations may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any such legislation or regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. see "- regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth," and "- risks related to our business - competitive factors may adversely affect our market share and profitability" below.
adverse global capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital the global capital and credit markets may be subject to periods of extreme volatility. disruptions in capital markets could cause our liquidity and credit capacity to be limited.
we need liquidity to pay claims and other operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, provide our subsidiaries with cash or collateral, maintain our securities lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities. without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations and limit our investments, and our business and financial results may suffer. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources."
42
in the event global capital market or other conditions have an adverse impact on our capital and liquidity, or our stress-testing indicates that such conditions could have such an impact beyond expectations and our current resources do not satisfy our needs or regulatory requirements, we may have to seek additional financing. the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as the then current market conditions, regulatory considerations, availability of credit to us and the financial services industry generally, our credit ratings and credit capacity, and the perception of our customers and lenders regarding our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large operating or investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.
our liquidity requirements may change if, among other things, we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice under securities lending or derivatives agreements or are required to post collateral or make payments related to declines in market value of specified counterparty credit risk. see "- investments-related risks - should the need arise, we may have difficulty selling certain holdings in our investment portfolio or in our securities lending program in a timely manner and realizing full value given their illiquid nature," "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments - securities lending" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - the company - liquidity."
disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital needed to operate our business, most significantly in our insurance operations. such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements, and access the capital necessary to grow our business. see "- regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth." as a result, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of securities than we would have otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, issue shorter tenor securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets.
we are exposed to significant global financial and capital markets risks which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause our net investment income to vary from period to period we are exposed to significant global financial and capital markets risks, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange rates, market volatility, global economic performance in general, the performance of specific obligors, including governments, included in our investment portfolio, derivatives and other factors outside our control. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - industry trends - financial and economic environment" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments - current environment."
interest rate risk some of our products, principally traditional life, universal life, fixed annuities and guaranteed interest contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our investment margin or "spread," or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general account and the rate of return we earn on general account investments intended to support obligations under such contracts. our spread is a key component of our net income.
in a low interest rate environment, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, which will reduce our investment margin. moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and commercial, agricultural or residential mortgage loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates, thereby exacerbating this risk. although lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in spreads on some products, our ability to lower these rates is limited to the portion of our in-force product portfolio that has adjustable interest crediting rates, and could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. as a result, our spread could decrease or potentially become negative, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. see "- risks related to our business - guarantees within certain of our products may decrease our earnings, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased counterparty risk."
43
our expectation for future spreads is an important component in the amortization of dac and value of business acquired ("voba"). significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period and potentially negatively affecting our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition. in addition, during periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers. this could result in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in-force from year to year, during a period when our new investments carry lower returns. a decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. during periods of sustained lower interest rates, our reserves for policy liabilities may not be sufficient to meet future policy obligations and may need to be strengthened. accordingly, declining and sustained lower interest rates may materially affect our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, and ability to take dividends from operating insurance companies, as well as significantly reduce our profitability. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - industry trends - impact of a sustained low interest rate environment."
as a global insurance company, we are also affected by the monetary policies of the federal reserve board and of central banks around the world. actions resulting from these policies may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments, and may adversely impact the income we earn on our investments or the level of product sales. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments - current environment."
increases in interest rates could also negatively affect our profitability. in periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest rate sensitive products competitive. we, therefore, may have to accept a lower credit spread and, thus, lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. in addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. this process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. unanticipated withdrawals, terminations and substantial policy amendments may cause us to accelerate the amortization of dac and voba, which reduces net income and potentially negatively affects our credit instrument covenants and rating agency assessment of our financial condition, and may also cause us to accelerate the amortization of negative voba, which increases net income. an increase in interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. finally, an increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds. however, this increase in interest rates would typically cause any guaranteed living benefits to decline in value. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - industry trends - impact of a sustained low interest rate environment."
we manage interest rate risk as part of our asset and liability management strategies, which include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that reflects the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. we also use derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk. although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. in addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders' equity in any given period because our non-qualified derivatives are recorded at fair value through earnings, while the related hedged items either follow an accrual-based accounting model, such as insurance liabilities, or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income. see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the primary reasons why many of the company's derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, even though they may be effective economic hedges.
significant volatility in the markets could cause changes in the risks set forth above which, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows through realized investment losses, derivative losses, changes in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves for future policyholder benefits, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions.
44
credit spreads our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price volatility and cash flow variability associated with changes in such spreads. market price volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent, as was the case, for example, during the financial crisis which commenced in 2008. in such case, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period-to-period changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and may require additional reserves. if there is a resumption of significant volatility in the markets, it could cause changes in credit spreads and defaults and a lack of pricing transparency which, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments - investment risks." an increase in credit spreads relative to u.s. treasury benchmarks can also adversely affect the cost of our borrowing should we need to access credit markets.
equity risk our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our businesses where fee income is earned based upon the estimated fair value of the assets under management. downturns and volatility in equity markets can have a material adverse effect on the revenues and investment returns from our savings and investment products and services. the retail variable annuity business in particular is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets could decrease revenues and earnings with respect to those products. furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate. we use derivatives and reinsurance to mitigate the impact of such increased potential benefit exposures.
we are also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. sustained declines in long-term interest rates or equity returns likely would have a negative effect on the funded status of these plans.
in addition, we invest a portion of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds. the amount and timing of net investment income from such funds tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying investments. the timing of distributions from such funds, which depends on particular events relating to the underlying investments, as well as the funds' schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult to predict. as a result, the amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period. significant volatility could adversely impact returns and net investment income on these alternative investment classes. in addition, the estimated fair value of such investments may be impacted by downturns or volatility in equity markets. see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
real estate risk our primary exposure to real estate risk relates to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate. our exposure to these risks stems from various factors, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets volatility, interest rate fluctuations, commodity prices and farm incomes, which have recently been declining. although we manage credit risk and market valuation risk for our commercial, agricultural and residential real estate assets through geographic, property type and product type diversification, as well as asset allocation, general economic conditions in the commercial, agricultural and residential real estate sectors will continue to influence the performance of these investments. these factors, which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.
obligor-related risks recent country specific volatility due to local economic and/or political concerns has affected the performance of certain of our investments. we have exposure to such volatility, as we maintain general account investments in such countries to support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities in these countries and we also have exposure through our global portfolio diversification. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - industry trends - financial and economic environment" and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments - current environment - selected country investments."
45
our investment portfolio also contains investments in revenue bonds issued under the auspices of u.s. states and municipalities, and a limited amount of general obligation bonds of u.s. states and municipalities (collectively, "state and political subdivision securities"). various u.s. states and municipalities have faced budget deficits and financial difficulties. the financial difficulties of such u.s. states and municipalities could have an adverse impact on our state and political subdivision securities and the value of our investment portfolio.
fixed income securities and mortgage loans represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. we are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of fixed income securities and mortgage loans we own may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. we are also subject to the risk that the underlying collateral within asset-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities, may default on principal and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows. the occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening mortgage or credit spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers, guarantors or underlying collateral of these securities and mortgage loans could cause the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and our earnings to decline and the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio to increase.
foreign currency exchange rate risks our primary foreign currency exchange rate risks are described under "- risks related to our business - fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our profitability." changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly affect our net investment income in any period, and such changes can be substantial. this risk will increase if a country withdraws from the euro zone. in such case, the national currency to which such a country may revert will likely be devalued and contracts using the euro will need to be renegotiated. any such devaluation and its related consequences for our contracts and investments in any such country could be significant and materially adversely affect our operations and earnings in that country. any operations we may have in any such withdrawing country could also be materially adversely affected by legal or governmental actions related to conversion from the euro to a national currency. see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
derivatives risk we use the payments we receive from counterparties pursuant to derivative instruments into which we have entered to offset future changes in the fair value of our assets and liabilities and current or future changes in cash flows. we enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, futures, forwards, and interest rate and credit default swaps with a number of counterparties. amounts that we expect to collect under current and future derivatives are subject to counterparty risk. our obligations under our products are not changed by our hedging activities and we are liable for our obligations even if our derivative counterparties do not pay us. such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. substantially all of our derivatives require us to pledge or receive collateral or make payments related to any decline in the net estimated fair value of such derivatives executed through a specific broker at a clearinghouse or entered into with a specific counterparty on a bilateral basis. in addition, ratings downgrades or financial difficulties of derivative counterparties may require us to utilize additional capital with respect to the impacted businesses.
summary significant volatility in the markets could cause changes in interest rates, declines in equity prices, and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar which, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows through realized investment losses, derivative losses, changes in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves for future policyholder benefits, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions.
46
regulatory and legal risks our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth our insurance operations and brokerage businesses are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. additionally, dodd-frank, discussed further below, effected the most far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation in the united states in decades. however, president trump and the majority party have expressed goals to dismantle or roll back dodd-frank and president trump has issued an executive order that calls for a comprehensive review of dodd-frank in light of certain enumerated core principles of financial system regulation. we are not able to predict with certainty whether any such proposal would have a material effect on our business operations and cannot currently identify all of the risks or opportunities, if any, that may be posed to our businesses as a result of changes to, or legislative replacements for, dodd-frank. see "business - regulation," as supplemented by discussions of regulatory developments in our subsequently filed quarterly reports on form 10-q under the caption "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - industry trends - regulatory developments."
u.s. regulation insurance regulation the naic is an organization whose mission is to assist state insurance regulatory authorities in serving the public interest and achieving the insurance regulatory goals of its members, the state insurance regulatory officials. state insurance regulators may act independently or adopt regulations proposed by the naic. state insurance regulators and the naic regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, can sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
in 2015, the naic commenced an initiative to study variable annuity solvency regulations, with the goal of curtailing the use of variable annuity captives. in connection with this study, the naic engaged a third-party consultant to develop recommendations in 2016 regarding reserve and capital requirements. the naic plans to ask the third-party consultant to conduct an additional study and develop new recommendations in 2017. the naic will consider the 2017 recommendations which, if adopted, would apply to insurers' existing and new business and likely would materially change the sensitivity of the balance sheet (including reserve and capital requirements) to capital markets. it is not possible to predict whether the amount of reserves or capital required to support our variable annuity contracts would increase or decrease if any such 2017 recommendations are adopted, nor is it possible to predict the extent to which any such recommendations would affect the effectiveness and design of our risk mitigation and hedging programs. furthermore, no assurances can be given as to whether any such recommendations will be adopted or to the timing of any such adoption.
the naic is also studying its rbc factors for bonds, real estate and collateral pledged to support fhlb advances. it is premature to project the impact of any such adoption.
the naic has also been working on the modernization of the calculation of life insurance reserves, including principle-based reserving, which became operative on january 1, 2017 in those states where it has been adopted, with a three-year phase-in period, at the option of insurance companies on a product-by-product basis, for new business. to date, principle-based reserving has been adopted by all of the states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, except in new york where the nydfs has publicly stated its intention to implement this approach beginning in january 2018, subject to a working group of the nydfs establishing the necessary reserves safeguards, and in massachusetts where the legislature is considering legislation in this area. we cannot predict how principle-based reserving will impact the reserves or compliance costs, if any, of our insurance subsidiaries, although after the separation, principle-based reserving will have less of an impact, given our discontinuance of retail life sales. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - insurance regulation - naic."
47
u.s. federal regulation affecting insurance currently, the business of insurance is primarily regulated at the state level. however, dodd-frank established the fio within the department of the treasury, which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the u.s., as well as to collect information about the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. on december 12, 2013, the fio issued a report, mandated by dodd-frank, which, among other things, urged the states to modernize and promote greater uniformity in insurance regulation. the report raised the possibility of a greater role for the federal government if states do not achieve greater uniformity in their laws and regulations. following the transition occurring in the united states government and the priorities of the trump administration, we cannot predict with certainty whether any such legislation or regulatory changes will be adopted, or what impact they will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - insurance regulation - federal initiatives."
federal legislation and administrative policies can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies, including policies regarding financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. in addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies.
erisa considerations we provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to erisa or the code. as such, our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by erisa and the code, including the requirement under erisa that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of erisa plan participants and beneficiaries, and those fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions. the prohibited transaction rules of erisa and the code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to erisa plans and participants and iras if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to the individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen, unless an exemption or exception is available. similarly, without an exemption or exception, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. erisa also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.
the dol issued new regulations on april 6, 2016 with an applicable date for most provisions of april 10, 2017. these regulations substantially expand the definition of "investment advice" and thereby broaden the circumstances under which metlife or its representatives, in providing investment advice with respect to erisa plans, plan participants or iras, could be deemed a fiduciary under erisa or the code. pursuant to the final regulations, certain communications with plans, plan participants and ira holders, including the sales of products, and investment management or advisory services, could be deemed fiduciary investment advice, thus causing increased exposure to fiduciary liability if the distributor does not recommend what is in the client's best interests. while the final regulations also provide that, to a limited extent, contracts sold and advice provided prior to april 10, 2017 do not have to be modified to comply with the new investment advice regulations, there is lack of clarity surrounding some of the conditions for qualifying for this limited exception. there can be no assurance that the dol will agree with our interpretation of the provisions of the new regulations, in which case the dol and irs could assess significant penalties against a portion of products sold prior to april 10, 2017. the assessment of such penalties could also trigger substantial litigation risk. any such penalties and related litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
the dol also issued amendments to certain of its prohibited transaction exemptions, and issued a new exemption that applies more onerous disclosure and contract requirements to, and increases fiduciary requirements and fiduciary liability exposure in respect of, certain transactions involving erisa plans, plan participants and iras.
while we continue to analyze the impact of the final regulations on our business as we plan for their implementation, we believe they could have an adverse effect on sales of annuity products to erisa qualified plans such as iras through our independent distribution partners. the new regulations deem advisors, including independent distributors, who sell fixed index-linked annuities to iras, ira rollovers or 401(k) plans, fiduciaries and prohibit them from receiving compensation unless they comply with a prohibited transaction exemption. the exemption requires advisors to comply with impartial conduct standards and may require us to exercise additional oversight of the sales process. compliance with the prohibited transaction exemption will likely result in increased regulatory burdens on us and our independent distribution partners, changes to our compensation practices and product offerings and increased litigation risk, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - erisa considerations."

however, in light of action by president trump on february 3, 2017, the applicability date of april 10, 2017 may well be delayed. it is also possible that the substance of the regulation could be substantially modified or replaced due to the change in administration. we cannot predict with certainty what other proposals may be made or what legislation or regulations may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any such legislation or regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
potential regulation of metlife, inc. as a non-bank sifi on december 18, 2014, the fsoc designated metlife, inc. as a non-bank sifi. on january 13, 2015, metlife, inc. filed an action in the d.c. district court asking the court to review and rescind the fsoc's designation. on march 30, 2016, the d.c. district court ordered that the designation of metlife, inc. as a non-bank sifi by the fsoc be rescinded. on april 8, 2016, the fsoc appealed the d.c. district court's order to the d.c. circuit court of appeals, and oral argument was heard on october 24, 2016.
if the fsoc prevails on appeal or re-designates metlife, inc. as systemically important as part of its ongoing review of non-bank financial companies, metlife, inc. could once again be subject to regulation that could materially and adversely affect our business and competitive position. non-bank sifis are supervised by the federal reserve board and subject to enhanced prudential standards which dodd-frank requires the federal reserve board to adopt. these enhanced prudential standards, include rbc requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, overall risk management requirements, resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements, and concentration limits. dodd-frank also authorizes the federal reserve board to adopt other standards applicable to non-bank sifis, including contingent capital requirements, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits, and other appropriate standards. in addition, non-bank sifis are subject to stress testing and must pay a variety of assessments, including those relating to any uncovered costs arising in connection with the resolution of a systemically important financial company, expenses incurred by the federal reserve board in fulfilling its oversight role, and funding the office of financial research within the u.s. department of treasury. the federal reserve board has not yet fully implemented most of the standards that will apply to non-bank sifis. accordingly, the manner in which the ultimate standards might apply to metlife, inc. were it to be re-designated as a non-bank sifi and the full impact of such standards, remains unclear. if metlife, inc. were to be re-designated as a non-bank sifi, however, it is possible that such regulations could constrain our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect our capital, or cause us to raise the price of the products we offer, reduce the amount of risk we take on, or stop offering certain products altogether.
the trump administration has released a memorandum that generally delayed all pending regulations from publication in the federal register pending their review and approval by a department or agency head appointed or designated by president trump. president trump has also issued an executive order that calls for a comprehensive review of dodd-frank and requires the secretary of the treasury to consult with the heads of the member agencies of fsoc to identify any laws, regulations or requirements that inhibit federal regulation of the financial system in a manner consistent with the core principles identified in the executive order. we cannot predict with certainty what other proposals may be made or what legislation or regulations may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any such legislation or regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
on january 12, 2016, metlife, inc. announced its plan to pursue the separation. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive summary - other key information - significant events." there can be no assurance that any actions taken in furtherance of this plan will affect any decision the fsoc may make to re-designate metlife, inc. as a non-bank sifi. we may consider further structural and other business alternatives that may be available to us in response to any re-designation of metlife as a non-bank sifi, and we cannot predict the impact that any such alternatives, if implemented, may have on the company or its security holders. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - potential regulation as a non-bank sifi" for additional information regarding potential regulation of metlife, inc. as a non-bank sifi.

international regulation our international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. a significant portion of our revenues is generated through operations in foreign jurisdictions, including many countries in early stages of economic and political development. our international operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators. see "- risks related to our business - our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks, including exposure to local and regional economic conditions, that could negatively affect those operations or our profitability." this may also impact many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries. changes in the laws and regulations that affect these customers and independent sales intermediaries or their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. accordingly, these changes and actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions. we expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the u.s., as well as regulatory oversight, generally, to continue to increase. the authority of our international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. the regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate and changes in laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. see "business - regulation - international regulation."
solvency regimes we are subject to solvency ii which became effective on january 1, 2016 in the eea, and are subject to solvency ii-like frameworks in mexico and china, with other similar solvency standards under development in other markets such as brazil and chile. see "business - regulation - international regulation - solvency regimes." as requirements are finalized by the regulators, capital requirements might be impacted in a number of jurisdictions. in addition, our legal entity structure throughout europe may impact our capital requirements, risk management infrastructure and reporting by country.
global systemically important insurers in the wake of the financial crisis, national and international authorities have proposed measures intended to increase the intensity of regulation of large financial institutions, requiring greater coordination among regulators and efforts to harmonize regulatory regimes. for example, the iais is participating in the fsb's initiative to identify and manage global systemically important financial institutions. to this end, the iais published a methodology to assess the systemic relevance of global insurers and a framework of policy measures to be applied to g-siis. g-sii designation is an annual process. the iais published revised assessment methodology in june 2016 as the new basis for annual designation and, on this basis, the fsb again so designated metlife, inc. in 2016. while the regulatory standards that would apply to g-siis are still being developed, they may include enhanced capital standards and supervision and other additional requirements that would not apply to companies that are not g-siis. the iais proposals would need to be implemented at the consolidated group level by legislation or regulation in each applicable jurisdiction. as metlife, inc. is no longer a u.s. non-bank sifi and none of its regulators have proposed implementing the g-sii requirements, the impact on metlife, inc. of such global proposals is uncertain. see "business - regulation - international regulation - global systemically important insurers."
general from time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of metlife, inc.'s regulated subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. in addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements. compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

the dodd-frank provisions compelling the liquidation of certain types of financial institutions could materially and adversely affect metlife, inc., as such a financial institution and as an investor in other such financial institutions, as well as our investors under provisions of dodd-frank, if metlife, inc. or another financial institution were to become insolvent or were in danger of defaulting on its obligations and it was determined that such default would have serious effects on financial stability in the u.s., it could be compelled to undergo liquidation with the fdic as receiver. while under this new regime an insurance company would be resolved in accordance with state insurance law, if the fdic were appointed as the receiver for another type of a company (including an insurance holding company such as metlife, inc.), liquidation of that company would occur under the provisions of the new liquidation authority, and not under the bankruptcy code, which ordinarily governs liquidations. in an fdic-managed liquidation, holders of a company's debt could in certain respects be treated differently than under the bankruptcy code and similarly-situated creditors could be treated differently. in particular, unsecured creditors and shareholders are intended to bear the losses of the company being liquidated. these provisions could also apply to financial institutions whose debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and could adversely affect our position as a creditor and the value of our holdings.
dodd-frank also provides for the assessment of charges against certain financial institutions, including non-bank sifis and bank holding companies and other financial companies with assets of $50 billion or more, to cover the costs of liquidating any financial company subject to the new liquidation authority. the liquidation authority could increase our funding costs. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - potential regulation as a non-bank sifi - orderly liquidation authority." see also "- our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth" for information regarding the trump administration's expressed goals to dismantle or roll back dodd-frank.
legislative and regulatory activity in health care and other employee benefits could affect our profitability as a provider of life insurance, annuities, and non-medical health insurance benefit products the affordable care act has led to fundamental changes in the way that employers, including us, provide health care benefits and other forms of compensation to their employees and former employees. in addition to imposing obligations on metlife as an enterprise, the affordable care act also imposes requirements on us as a provider of non-medical health insurance benefits and as a purchaser of certain of these products. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - insurance regulation - health care regulation" for information regarding such requirements, including the effect of assessments related to public healthcare exchanges. the affordable care act or other related regulations or regulatory actions may adversely affect our ability to continue to offer certain non-medical health and dental insurance products in the same manner as we do today and may continue to result in increased and unpredictable costs to provide certain products thereby harming our competitive position.
in addition, we employ a substantial number of employees in the united states to whom we offer employment-related benefits. we also currently provide benefits to certain of our retirees. these benefits are provided under complex plans that are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements. the affordable care act or related regulations or regulatory actions could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate our associates. they could also result in increased or unpredictable costs to provide employee benefits, and could harm our competitive position if we are subject to fees, penalties, tax provisions or other limitations in the affordable care act and our competitors are not.
the preservation of access to care for medicare beneficiaries and pension relief act of 2010 also includes certain provisions for defined benefit pension plan funding relief. these provisions may impact the likelihood and/or timing of corporate plan sponsors terminating their plans and/or engaging in transactions to partially or fully transfer pension obligations to an insurance company. consequently, this law could indirectly affect the mix of our business, with fewer pension risk transfers and more non-guaranteed funding products, and adversely impact our results of operations.
changes in u.s. federal, state securities and state insurance laws and regulations may affect our operations and our profitability federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that are also "securities," including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, as well as certain fixed interest rate or index-linked contracts with features that require them to be registered as securities ("registered fixed contracts"). as a result, some of metlife, inc.'s subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under these securities laws.
51
federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in the securities markets, and to protect investment advisory or brokerage clients. these laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to adopt new rules impacting new and/or existing products, regulate the issuance, sales and distribution of our products and limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with the securities laws and regulations.
as a result of dodd-frank, there have been a number of changes proposed or adopted to the laws and regulations that govern the conduct of our variable and registered fixed insurance products business and the firms that distribute these products. the future impact of recently adopted revisions to laws and regulations, as well as revisions that are still in the proposal stage, on the way we conduct our business and the products we sell is unclear. such impact could adversely affect our operations and profitability, including increasing the regulatory and compliance burden upon us, resulting in increased costs, or limiting the type, amount or structure of compensation arrangements into which we may enter with certain of our employees, negatively impacting our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting and maintaining key personnel. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - erisa considerations" and "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - securities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulation." however, following the change of administration, we cannot predict with certainty whether any such proposals will be adopted, or what impact adopted revisions will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. see "- our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth" for information regarding the trump administration's expressed goals to dismantle or roll back dodd-frank. we also may be subject to similar laws and regulations in the foreign countries in which we offer products or conduct other activities similar to those described above. see "business - regulation - international regulation."
the global financial crisis has led to significant changes in economic and financial markets that have, in turn, led to a dynamic competitive landscape for variable and registered fixed product issuers. our ability to react to rapidly changing market and economic conditions will depend on the continued efficacy of provisions we have incorporated into our product design allowing frequent and contemporaneous revisions of key pricing elements and our ability to work collaboratively with federal securities regulators. changes in regulatory approval processes, rules and other dynamics in the regulatory process could adversely impact our ability to react to such changing conditions.
changes in tax laws or interpretations of such laws could reduce our earnings and materially impact our operations by increasing our corporate taxes and making some of our products less attractive to consumers changes in domestic or foreign tax laws or interpretations of such laws could increase our corporate taxes and reduce our earnings. for example, in the third quarter of 2015, metlife, inc. recorded a $792 million after-tax charge, or $.70 per share, under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties as a result of our consideration of decisions of the u.s. court of appeals for the second circuit upholding the disallowance of foreign tax credits claimed by other corporate entities not affiliated with us (in transactions different from ours), based upon a changed interpretation of the proper method of determining that a transaction has economic substance. additionally, global budget deficits make it likely that governments' need for additional revenue will result in future tax proposals that will increase our effective tax rate. however, it remains difficult to predict the timing and effect that future tax law changes could have on our earnings both in the u.s. and in foreign jurisdictions. such changes could not only directly impact our corporate taxes but also could adversely impact our products (both life insurance and retirement plans) by making some of our products less attractive to consumers. a shift away from life insurance and annuity contracts and other tax-deferred products by our customers would reduce our income from sales of these products, as well as the asset base upon which we earn investment income and fees, thereby reducing our earnings and potentially affecting the value of our deferred tax assets.
additionally, the trump administration and congress have publicly stated that fundamental u.s. tax reform is a priority. the substance, timing and likelihood of such reform are all uncertain. such reform could impact the company's corporate taxes and products, whether favorably or adversely. while current tax reform proposals generally include a reduction of the u.s. corporate tax rate, given the overall u.s. budget deficit it is likely that any tax reform will include provisions which would raise revenues. thus, it is not possible to predict with certainty whether the reform would be beneficial or adverse to metlife, inc.
52
litigation and regulatory investigations are increasingly common in our businesses and may result in significant financial losses and/or harm to our reputation we face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate. in connection with our insurance operations, plaintiffs' lawyers may bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product design, disclosure, administration, investments, denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers. plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain. uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law. material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us and risks to our business presented by these proceedings are discussed in note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. updates are provided in the notes to our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in our subsequently filed quarterly reports on form 10-q, as well as in part ii, item 1 ("legal proceedings") of those quarterly reports.
a substantial legal liability or a significant federal, state or other regulatory action against us, as well as regulatory inquiries or investigations, could harm our reputation, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant legal costs and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, our ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees could be materially and adversely impacted. regulatory inquiries and litigation may also cause volatility in the price of stocks of companies in our industry.
current claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and other proceedings against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. it is also possible that related or unrelated claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future, and we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. we currently have a market presence in numerous countries and may be subject to additional investigations and lawsuits in these jurisdictions. increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings in any of the countries where we operate could result in new legal actions and precedents and industry-wide regulations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
risks related to acquisitions, dispositions or other structural changes we may not complete the separation of brighthouse financial on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all on october 5, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, brighthouse, filed a registration statement on form 10 with the sec in connection with the previously announced separation of a substantial portion of our former retail segment, as well as certain portions of our former corporate benefit funding segment. the form 10, as amended, reflects our current plan to initiate the separation in the form of an initial spin-off of 80.1% of the outstanding common stock of brighthouse. while we and brighthouse are currently preparing for a spin-off transaction, the ultimate form and timing of a separation will be influenced by a number of factors, including regulatory considerations and economic conditions. we continue to evaluate and pursue structural alternatives for the proposed separation. metlife has initiated the regulatory process for the proposed separation of brighthouse financial. unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the currently proposed spin-off of brighthouse, including possible problems or delays in obtaining various insurance and other regulatory approvals, tax approvals (including the failure of such a separation to qualify for any intended tax-free treatment) and disruptions in the capital and financial markets. in addition, consummation of the currently proposed spin-off will require final approval from our board of directors. therefore, we cannot assure that we will complete the separation in the form, on the terms or on the timeline that we announced, if at all.
53
in order to position ourselves for the proposed separation, we are actively pursuing strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our former retail segment (now, the brighthouse financial and metlife holdings segments). these actions could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our businesses and complete the proposed separation, weakening of our internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of our relationship with key customers and counterparties. we have and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed separation. we also may not achieve certain of the benefits that we expect to achieve in connection with the separation, including dividends from brighthouse to metlife, inc., due to, among other things, the inability of brighthouse to raise sufficient funds by the incurrence of debt or otherwise, or lower than expected dividends received by brighthouse from its subsidiaries. in addition, completion of the proposed separation will require significant amounts of our management's time and effort which may divert management's attention from operating and growing our remaining businesses and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we could face difficulties, unforeseen liabilities, asset impairments or rating actions arising from business acquisitions or integrating and managing growth of such businesses, dispositions of businesses, or legal entity reorganizations we have engaged in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive summary - other key information - significant events" for information regarding metlife, inc.'s plan to pursue the separation, as well as the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture. such activity exposes us to a number of risks arising from (i) potential difficulties achieving projected financial results, including the costs and benefits of integration or deconsolidation; (ii) unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments; (iii) the scope and duration of rights to indemnification for losses; (iv) the use of capital which could be used for other purposes; (v) rating agency reactions; (vi) regulatory requirements that could impact our operations or capital requirements; (vii) changes in statutory or u.s. gaap accounting principles, practices or policies; and (viii) certain other risks specifically arising from activities relating to an initial public offering, spin-off, joint venture or legal entity reorganization, including in connection with the proposed separation.
the valuation and structure for any transaction reflect our financial projections and other qualitative and quantitative factors. every transaction exposes us to the risk that actual results may materially differ from what we have projected. factors that can cause our ultimate experience to vary materially from financial projections made at the time we enter into a transaction include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic, business growth, demographic, policyholder behavior and other actuarial assumptions, regulatory and political conditions.
risks relating to acquisitions our ability to achieve certain financial benefits we anticipate from any acquisitions of businesses will depend in part upon our ability to successfully integrate such businesses in an efficient and effective manner. we may not be able to integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may take longer than expected. the integration of operations and differences in organizational culture may require the dedication of significant management resources, which may distract management's attention from day-to-day business. if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of such acquired businesses, we may be unable to realize the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of such acquisitions and our business and results of operations may be less than expected.
54
the success with which we are able to integrate acquired operations will depend on our ability to manage a variety of issues, including the following:
•   loss of key personnel or higher than expected employee attrition rates could adversely affect the performance of the acquired business and our ability to integrate it successfully.
•   customers of the acquired business may reduce, delay or defer decisions concerning their use of its products and services as a result of the acquisition or uncertainty related to the consummation of the acquisition, including, for example, potential unfamiliarity with the metlife brand in regions where we did not have a market presence prior to the acquisition.
•   if the acquired business relies upon independent distributors to distribute its products, these distributors may not continue to generate the same volume of business for us after the acquisition. independent distributors may reexamine the scope of their relationship with the acquired business or us as a result of the acquisition and decide to curtail or eliminate distribution of our products.
•   if the acquired business relies on continued distribution access with another party, we are also exposed to the risk of loss of exclusivity or change in access due to regulatory changes.
•   integrating acquired operations with our existing operations may require us to coordinate geographically separated organizations, address possible differences in corporate culture and management philosophies, merge financial processes and risk and compliance procedures, combine separate information technology platforms and integrate operations that were previously closely tied to the former parent of the acquired business or other service providers.
•   in cases where we or an acquired business operates in certain markets through joint ventures, the acquisition may affect the continued success and prospects of the joint venture.
•   we may incur significant costs in connection with any acquisition and the related integration. the costs and liabilities actually incurred in connection with an acquisition and subsequent integration process may exceed those anticipated.
there could be unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments, including goodwill impairments, which arise in connection with the businesses that we may sell or the businesses that we may acquire in the future.
in addition, there may be liabilities or asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing acquisition-related due diligence investigations. furthermore, even for obligations and liabilities that we do discover during the due diligence process, neither the valuation adjustment nor the contractual protections we negotiate may be sufficient to fully protect us from losses. although we generally have rights to indemnification for certain losses, our rights may be limited by survival periods for bringing claims and limitations on the nature and amount of losses we may recover, and we cannot be certain that indemnification will be, among other things, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset any loss we may suffer. the use of our own funds as consideration in any acquisition would consume capital resources, which could affect our capital plan and render those funds unavailable for other corporate purposes. we also may not be able to raise sufficient funds to consummate an acquisition if, for example, we are unable to sell our securities or close related bridge credit facilities.
risks relating to dispositions we may from time to time dispose of business or blocks of in-force business through an outright sale, reinsurance transaction or by alternate means such as a public offering of shares in an independent, publicly traded company or a spin-off, which would also result in a separate, possibly independent and publicly traded, company. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - executive summary - other key information - significant events" for information on metlife, inc.'s announcement of its plan to pursue the separation, as well as the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture. the separation, depending on the specific form, would be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including, among other things, approval of any transaction by the metlife, inc. board of directors, satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the sec, and receipt of insurance and other regulatory approvals and other anticipated conditions. see "- we may not complete the separation of brighthouse financial on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all." in addition, transitional services or tax arrangements related to the separation may impose restrictions, liabilities, losses or indemnification obligations on us. furthermore, a distributor has elected to suspend, and other distributors may elect to suspend, alter, reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us for various reasons, including uncertainty related to the proposed separation, changes in our distribution strategy, adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks.
55
when we dispose of subsidiaries or operations, we may remain liable to the acquiror or to third parties for certain losses or costs arising from the divested business or on other bases. we may also not realize the anticipated profit on a disposition or incur a loss on the disposition. in anticipation of any disposition, we may need to restructure our operations, which could disrupt such operations and affect our ability to recruit key personnel needed to operate and grow such business pending the completion of such transaction. in addition, the actions of key employees of the business to be divested could adversely affect the success of such disposition as they may be more focused on obtaining employment, or the terms of their employment, than on maximizing the value of the business to be divested. furthermore, transitional services or tax arrangements related to any such separation could further disrupt our operations and may impose restrictions, liabilities, losses or indemnification obligations on us. depending on its particulars, a separation could increase our exposure to certain risks, such as by decreasing the diversification of our sources of revenue or by changing the percentage of our revenue being derived from non-u.s. sources. see "- risks related to our business - our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks, including exposure to local and regional economic conditions, that could negatively affect those operations or our profitability." any such separation could also affect the dividends available to be paid to metlife, inc. by the subsidiaries that are part of such separation. furthermore, we may be unable to timely dissolve all contractual relationships with the divested business in the course of the proposed transaction, which may materially adversely affect our ability to realize value from the disposition. such restructuring could also adversely affect our internal controls and procedures and impair our relationships with key customers, distributors and suppliers. an interruption or significant change in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. after any such disposition, shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a company different in size and characteristics from the present. these changes may cause some existing shareholders to sell their shares of our common stock, which could, if excessive, cause the market price of our common stock to decrease.
risks relating to joint ventures we participate in joint ventures, which may also include exclusive or semi-exclusive distribution relationships, in several countries, including china and india. we may enter into joint ventures with other companies or government sponsored enterprises in various other international markets, including joint ventures where we may have a lesser degree of control over the business operations, which may expose us to additional operational, financial, legal or compliance risks. we may be dependent on a joint venture counterparty for capital, product distribution, local market knowledge, or other resources. limits on our ownership levels under local laws or regulations may increase our dependence on joint venture counterparties and subsequent changes to such laws or regulations may impact how we account for our joint venture ownership interests or manage the joint venture. regulations regarding the level of foreign ownership or operations of such entities or limitation on distribution exclusivity may affect the value of a joint venture. see "- risks related to our business - our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks, including exposure to local and regional economic conditions, that could negatively affect those operations or our profitability."
a joint venture may require an investment of considerable management, financial and operational resources to establish sufficient infrastructure such as underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance or other processes. if we are unable to effectively cooperate with joint venture counterparties, or any joint venture counterparty fails to meets its obligations under the joint venture arrangement, encounters financial difficulty, or elects to alter, modify or terminate the relationship, we may be unable to exercise management control or influence over these joint venture operations and our ability to achieve our objectives and our results of operations may be negatively impacted thereby impairing our investment.
risks relating to legal entity reorganizations in addition, we may reorganize or consolidate the legal entities through which we conduct business. the implementation of legal entity reorganizations is a complex undertaking and involves a number of risks similar to those outlined above that are present in the case of an acquisition, including additional costs and expenses, information technology-related delays and problems, loss of key personnel and distraction of management. over the past several years, we have pursued two significant reorganizations. for example, in november 2014, the company completed the mergers into metlife usa of certain of its affiliates and a subsidiary. in 2015, we substantially completed a reorganization of many of our foreign entities under a single holding company. many aspects of these transactions are subject to regulatory approvals from a number of different jurisdictions. we may not obtain needed regulatory approvals in the timeframe anticipated or at all, which could reduce or prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of these transactions. these transactions or the related regulatory approvals may entail modifications of certain aspects of our operations, the composition of certain of our investment portfolios, and/or the cost of our derivatives hedging activities, which could result in additional costs or reduce net investment income. these transactions are often effected to achieve certain operational, capital or tax benefits and to the extent not realized could affect the ongoing value and financial results of such entities. any of these risks, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
56
investments-related risks should the need arise, we may have difficulty selling certain holdings in our investment portfolio or in our securities lending program in a timely manner and realizing full value given their illiquid nature there may be a limited market for certain investments we hold in our investment portfolio, making them relatively illiquid. these include privately-placed fixed maturity securities, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, leveraged leases, other limited partnership interests, and real estate equity, such as real estate joint ventures and funds. in recent years, even some of our very high quality investments experienced reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption. if we were forced to sell certain of our investments during periods of market volatility or disruption, market prices may be lower than our carrying value in such investments. this could result in realized losses which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our financial ratios, which could affect compliance with our credit instruments and rating agency capital adequacy measures.
similarly, we loan blocks of our securities to third parties (primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks) through our securities lending program, including fixed maturity (primarily u.s. government and u.s. government-backed securities) and equity securities, short-term investments and cash equivalents. under this program, we obtain collateral, usually cash, at the inception of a loan and typically purchase securities with the cash collateral. upon the return to us of these loaned securities, we must return to the third party the cash collateral we received. if the cash collateral has been invested in securities, we need to sell the securities. however, in some cases, the maturity of those securities may exceed the term of the related securities on loan and the estimated fair value of the securities we need to sell may fall below the amount of cash received.
if we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral under our securities lending program or otherwise need significant amounts of cash on short notice and we are forced to sell securities, we may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize under normal market conditions, or both. in the event of a forced sale, accounting guidance requires the recognition of a loss for securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities based on our ability to hold those securities, which would negatively impact our financial condition, as well as our financial ratios, which could affect compliance with our credit instruments and rating agency capital adequacy measures. in addition, under stressful capital market and economic conditions, liquidity broadly deteriorates, which may further restrict our ability to sell securities. furthermore, if we decrease the amount of our securities lending activities over time, the amount of net investment income generated by these activities will also likely decline. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - the company - liquidity and capital uses - securities lending."
our requirements to pledge collateral or make payments related to declines in estimated fair value of derivatives transactions or specified assets in connection with otc-cleared and otc-bilateral transactions may adversely affect our liquidity, expose us to central clearinghouse and counterparty credit risk, and increase our costs of hedging substantially all of our derivatives transactions require us to pledge collateral related to any decline in the net estimated fair value of such derivatives transactions executed through a specific broker at a clearinghouse or entered into with a specific counterparty on a bilateral basis. certain derivatives financing transactions require us to pledge collateral or make payments related to declines in the estimated fair value of the specified assets under certain circumstances to central clearinghouses or our counterparties. the amount of collateral we may be required to pledge and the payments we may be required to make under our derivatives transactions may increase under certain circumstances and will increase as a result of the requirement to pledge initial margin for otc-cleared transactions and for otc-bilateral transactions entered into after the phase-in period, which will likely be applicable to us in september 2020 as a result of the adoption by the prudential regulators and the cftc of final margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives. although the final rules allow us to pledge a broad range of non-cash collateral as initial and variation margin, the prudential regulators, cftc, central clearinghouses and counterparties may restrict or eliminate certain types of previously eligible collateral or charge us to pledge such non-cash collateral, which would increase our costs and could adversely affect the liquidity of our investments and the composition of our investment portfolio. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - regulation of over-the-counter derivatives," "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - the company - liquidity and capital uses - pledged collateral," and note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
57
gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities and defaults, downgrades or other events may result in future impairments to the carrying value of such securities, resulting in a reduction in our net income fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available-for-sale ("afs") securities are reported at their estimated fair value. unrealized gains or losses on afs securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) ("oci") and are, therefore, excluded from net income. in recent periods, as a result of low interest rates, the unrealized gains on our fixed maturity securities have exceeded the unrealized losses. however, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains would decrease and our unrealized losses would increase, perhaps substantially. the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these afs securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments - fixed maturity and equity securities afs."
the occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities could cause the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and corresponding earnings to decline and cause the default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio to increase. a ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities, or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, could also have a similar effect. with economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected. similarly, a ratings downgrade affecting a security we hold could indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated and could increase the capital we must hold to support that security to maintain our rbc levels. levels of writedowns or impairments are impacted by intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fixed maturity securities, as well as our intent and ability to hold equity securities which have declined in value until recovery. realized losses or impairments on these securities may have a material adverse effect on our net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.
our valuation of securities and investments and the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments are subjective and include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and market conditions and, if changed, could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition fixed maturity, equity, fair value option ("fvo") and trading securities, as well as short-term investments that are reported at estimated fair value represent the majority of our total cash and investments. we define fair value generally as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. considerable judgment is often required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. during periods of market disruption including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. in addition, in times of financial market disruption, certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data may become illiquid. in those cases, the valuation process includes inputs that are less observable and require more subjectivity and management judgment. valuations may result in estimated fair values which vary significantly from the amount at which the investments may ultimately be sold. further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in estimated fair value could vary significantly. decreases in the estimated fair value of securities we hold may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments" and notes 1 and 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. we reflect any changes in allowances and impairments in earnings as such evaluations are revised. however, historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances. in addition, any such future impairments or allowances could have a materially adverse effect on our earnings and financial position. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - summary of critical accounting estimates - investment impairments" and note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

defaults on our mortgage loans and volatility in performance may adversely affect our profitability our mortgage loans face default risk and are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. we establish valuation allowances for estimated impairments, which are based on loan risk characteristics, historical default rates and loss severities, real estate market fundamentals and outlooks, as well as other relevant factors. in addition, substantially all of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loans held-for-investment have balloon payment maturities. an increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments or fluctuations in their performance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
further, any geographic or property type concentration of our mortgage loans may have adverse effects on our investment portfolio and consequently on our results of operations or financial condition. while we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated. moreover, our ability to sell assets relating to such particular groups of related assets may be limited if other market participants are seeking to sell at the same time. in addition, legislative proposals that would allow or require modifications to the terms of mortgage loans could be enacted. we cannot predict whether these proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business or investments. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments - mortgage loans."
the defaults or deteriorating credit of other financial institutions could adversely affect us we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and investment funds and other financial institutions. many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. in addition, with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. we also have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, non-redeemable and redeemable preferred securities, derivatives, joint venture, hedge fund and equity investments. further, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies in response to the financial crisis affecting the global banking system and financial markets, such as investment, nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, whether under existing legal authority or any new authority that may be created, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks' credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these investments or other changes may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
risks related to our business our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks, including exposure to local and regional economic conditions, that could negatively affect those operations or our profitability our international operations face political, legal, financial, operational and other risks. these operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of assets; the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies which may increase our dependence on joint venture counterparties and/or impact how we account for our joint venture ownership interests; changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations), their application or interpretation; political instability (including any resulting economic or trade sanctions); dividend limitations; price controls; changes in applicable currency; currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into u.s. dollars or other currencies, as well as other adverse actions by foreign governmental authorities and regulators, such as the retroactive application of new requirements on our current and prior activities or operations and the imposition of regulations limiting our ability to distribute our products. such actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions and could indirectly affect our business in other jurisdictions as well. some of our foreign insurance operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where these risks are heightened. for example, proposed reform of the chilean pension system, if enacted, may have a significant adverse effect on our business in chile. see "business - regulation - international regulation."
59
the trump administration has discussed potentially putting in place a tax on goods and services imported into the united states, including from countries in which we have international operations, such as mexico. for example, president trump has in the past referred to renegotiating nafta, which had eliminated most trade tariffs between the united states, canada and mexico. our business in mexico is not related to any trade agreements and is tied to the general economy and the growth of the market. we cannot predict with certainty what proposals may be made in connection with international trade agreements or what legislation or regulations may be introduced or enacted, or what impact any such legislation or regulations may have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
part of our international insurance operations may be subject to assessments, generally based on their proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations to policyholders and claimants resulting from the insolvency of insurance companies. we cannot predict the timing and scope of any assessments that may be made in the future, which may materially affect the results of operations of our international insurance operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. see "business - regulation - international regulation" and "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk," as well as "- regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth."
we have market presence in numerous countries and increased exposure to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. concerns about the political and/or economic stability in the u.k., italy, mexico, turkey and puerto rico have recently contributed to global market volatility. lack of legal certainty and stability in these regions exposes our operations there to increased risk of disruption and to adverse or unpredictable actions by regulators and may make it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts, which may negatively impact our business in these regions. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - industry trends - financial and economic environment."
on june 23, 2016, the u.k. held a referendum regarding its membership in the eu, resulting in a narrow vote in favor of leaving the eu. the u.k. subsequently indicated that it will initiate the withdrawal process by the end of march 2017. the member withdrawal provisions in the applicable eu treaty have not been used before so it is unclear how the provisions will work in practice. assuming the u.k. initiates the withdrawal process by giving notice that it is withdrawing from the eu, the relevant treaty provides that the u.k. and the eu will negotiate a withdrawal agreement during a maximum two-year period (unless such period is extended by unanimous vote of the other eu member states). it is currently anticipated that the withdrawal agreement would deal with the details of the immediate exit but would not set out final trade arrangements or deal comprehensively with other potentially significant matters. upon effectiveness of the withdrawal agreement, or, if no agreement is concluded in the two-year period, at the end of the period, the u.k. will no longer be a member of the eu. in the meantime, however, the u.k. remains a member of the eu with unchanged rights to access the single eu market in goods and services. our u.k. business model utilizes certain rights to operate cross-border insurance and investment operations which may be modified or eliminated as a result of the u.k. exiting the eu. operating expenses within our businesses could increase as a result of uncertainties during the negotiation period and in the event of an eventual u.k. withdrawal.
we face substantial exposure to the japanese economy given the size of our business there, and japan continues to experience overall sluggish economic performance. economic slowdowns and volatility may impact other markets where we have a material presence, including latin america and europe. unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the demand for our products, negatively impact earnings, adversely affect the performance of our investments or result in impairments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. see "- economic environment and capital markets-related risks - if difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally persist, they may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - investments - current environment - selected country investments."
furthermore, we rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter labor problems resulting from workers' associations and trade unions in some countries. if our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training the sales force in that country.
we are continuing to expand our international operations in certain markets where we operate and in selected new markets. this may require considerable management time, as well as start-up expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. the prospects of our business also may be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to manage the growth of such international operations successfully. there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing such future growth. further, operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local political, economic and market conditions. therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.
60
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our profitability we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar resulting from our holdings of non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, net income from foreign operations and issuance of non-u.s. dollar denominated instruments, including guaranteed interest contracts and funding agreements. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our non-u.s. dollar denominated investments, our investments in foreign subsidiaries, and our net income from foreign operations. in addition, from time to time, various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies. our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is exacerbated by our investments in these emerging markets. see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
in addition, certain of our life and annuity products are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk. payments under these contracts, depending on the circumstances, may be required to be made in different currencies and may not be the legal tender in the country whose law governs the particular product. changes in exchange rate movements and the imposition of capital controls may also directly impact the liability valuation that may not be entirely hedged. if the currency upon which expected future payments are made strengthens, the liability valuation may increase, which may result in a reduction of net income.
historically, we have matched substantially all of our foreign currency denominated liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with investments denominated in their respective foreign currency, which limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on local operating results; however, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation of these results into our u.s. dollar basis consolidated financial statements. although we take certain actions to address this risk, including entering into foreign currency derivatives, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially adversely affect our reported results due to unhedged positions, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting resulting from derivative gains (losses) on non-qualifying hedges, or the failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. our reported results could also be adversely affected if the economy of one or more of our foreign subsidiaries is determined to be "highly inflationary," generally defined by a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period.
we face significant exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in the yen/u.s. dollar exchange rate because we have substantial operations in japan and a large portion of our premiums and investment income in japan are received in yen. most claims and expenses associated with our operations in japan are also paid in yen and we primarily purchase yen-denominated assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. these and other yen-denominated financial statement items are, however, translated into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. accordingly, fluctuations in the yen/u.s. dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported financial position and results of operations. our japan operation does assume some currency exposure by backing a portion of surplus and yen-denominated liabilities with u.s. dollar assets. although this represents risk to our japan operation, this activity reduces yen exposure at the enterprise level. additionally, our japan operation sells u.s. dollar and australian dollar life and annuity products to japanese customers. we may experience elevated levels of early policy terminations when the japanese yen weakens against these currencies. while the cost of early policy terminations is offset by surrender charges, foreign exchange rate fluctuations will impact both our sales volumes and the amount of business we have in-force.
due to our significant international operations, during periods when any foreign currency from which we derive our revenues weakens (strengthens), translating amounts expressed in that currency into u.s. dollars causes fewer (more) u.s. dollars to be reported. any unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments ("fcta") are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("aoci"). the weakening of a foreign currency relative to the u.s. dollar will generally adversely affect the value of investments in u.s. dollar terms and reduce the level of reserves denominated in that currency.
an inability to access our credit facility could result in a reduction in our liquidity and lead to downgrades in our credit and financial strength ratings we rely on our unsecured credit facility maintained by metlife, inc. and metlife funding, inc. ("metlife funding"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of metlife, inc. (the "credit facility"), as a potential source of liquidity. the availability of this credit facility, which is currently $4.0 billion but which is expected to decrease to $3.0 billion upon the completion of the proposed separation, could be critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market when alternative sources of credit are tight. the credit facility contains certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants, including a requirement to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - the company - liquidity and capital sources - global funding sources - credit and committed facilities" and note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
61
our right to borrow funds under the credit facility is subject to the fulfillment of certain important conditions, including our compliance with all covenants, and our ability to borrow under the credit facility is also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders that are parties to the credit facility to provide funds. our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facility or fulfill the conditions to borrowings, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons) in the amounts provided for under the terms of the credit facility, would restrict our ability to access the credit facility when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
we may need to fund deficiencies in our closed block; assets allocated to the closed block benefit only the holders of closed block policies mlic's plan of reorganization, as amended, established in connection with its demutualization, required that we establish and operate an accounting mechanism, known as a closed block, to ensure that the reasonable dividend expectations of policyholders who own individual participating whole life insurance policies of mlic in force at the time of the demutualization are met. we allocated assets to the closed block in an amount that will produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenue from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and tax, and to provide for the continuation of the policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. the closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenue from the policies included in the closed block may not be sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies. if they are not, we must fund the shortfall. even if they are sufficient, we may choose, for competitive reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments with our general account funds.
the closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. in addition, to the extent that these amounts are greater than the amounts estimated at the time the closed block was funded, dividends payable in respect of the policies included in the closed block may be greater than they would be in the absence of a closed block. any excess earnings will be available for distribution over time only to closed block policyholders. see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations financial strength ratings are published by various nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("nrsros") and similar entities not formally recognized as nrsros. they indicate the nrsros' opinion regarding an insurance company's ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, and are important to maintaining public confidence in our products and our competitive position. see "business - company ratings" for additional information regarding our financial strength ratings.
downgrades in our financial strength ratings or changes to our rating outlooks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including:
•   reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other investment products;
•   adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and independent sales intermediaries;
•   materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders;
•   requiring us to post additional collateral under certain of our financing and derivative transactions;
•   requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive;
•   providing termination rights for the benefit of our derivative instrument counterparties;
•   adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all;
•   limiting our access to the capital markets;
•   potentially increasing the cost of debt;
•   requiring us to post collateral; and
•   subjecting us to potentially increased regulatory scrutiny.
62
in addition to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, various nrsros also publish credit ratings for metlife, inc. and several of its subsidiaries. credit ratings indicate the nrsros' opinion regarding a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impact of a one-notch downgrade with respect to derivative transactions with credit rating downgrade triggers and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - the company - liquidity and capital uses - pledged collateral" for further information on the impact of a one-notch downgrade. see also "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - the company - capital - rating agencies."
in view of the difficulties experienced by many financial institutions as a result of the financial crisis and ensuing global recession, including our competitors in the insurance industry, we believe it is possible that the nrsros will continue to heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies, will continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, will continue to request additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any nrsro.
reinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses as part of our overall risk management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. while reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing, market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business. in certain circumstances, the price of reinsurance for business already reinsured may also increase. for example, for some of our group businesses under which the policies and related reinsurance are subject to periodic (typically annual) renewal, prices may increase at any renewal. also, for most of our traditional life reinsurance agreements, it is common for the reinsurer to have a right to increase reinsurance rates on in-force business if there is a systematic deterioration of mortality in the market as a whole. any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in the amount of reinsurance, reduce our earnings. accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to those policies we issue. see "business - reinsurance activity" and "- if the counterparties to our reinsurance or indemnification arrangements or to the derivatives we use to hedge our business risks default or fail to perform, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations."
if the counterparties to our reinsurance or indemnification arrangements or to the derivatives we use to hedge our business risks default or fail to perform, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we use reinsurance, indemnification and derivatives to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. in general, reinsurance, indemnification and derivatives do not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers, indemnitors, counterparties and central clearinghouses. a reinsurer's, indemnitor's, counterparty's or central clearinghouse's insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of reinsurance agreements, indemnity agreements or derivatives agreements with us or inability or unwillingness to return collateral could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including our liquidity. see "business - reinsurance activity."
in addition, we use derivatives to hedge various business risks. we enter into a variety of derivatives, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties on a bilateral basis for uncleared otc derivatives and with clearing brokers and central clearinghouses for otc-cleared derivatives. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - derivatives." if our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under these derivatives, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. this risk is more pronounced in light of the stresses suffered by financial institutions over the past few years. such failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
63
differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions may adversely affect our financial results our earnings significantly depend upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in setting prices for our products and establishing liabilities for future policy benefits and claims. such amounts are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. to the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions we used in establishing such liabilities, we could be required to reduce dac and/or voba, increase our liabilities and/or incur higher costs.
due to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle our liabilities. such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. we evaluate our liabilities periodically based on accounting requirements, which change from time to time, the assumptions used to establish the liabilities, as well as our actual experience. if the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them and/or reduce associated dac and/or voba. such adjustments could affect earnings negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. see "business - policyholder liabilities" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - policyholder liabilities." see also "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - summary of critical accounting estimates - deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired," "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - summary of critical accounting estimates - derivatives," and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - results of operations - consolidated results - year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015 - actuarial assumption review" for further information regarding the manner in which policyholder behavior and other events may differ from our assumptions and, thereby affect our financial results.
catastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for policyholder claims and reinsurance availability our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic events. the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis and man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage or loss of life or property damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. claims resulting from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. in addition, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of issuers of obligations we hold in our investment portfolio, resulting in impairments to these obligations, and the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby increasing the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. large-scale catastrophes may also reduce the overall level of economic activity in affected countries which could hurt our business and the value of our investments or our ability to write new business. it is possible that increases in the value, caused by the effects of inflation or other factors, and geographic concentration of insured lives or property, could increase the severity of claims we receive from future catastrophic events.
our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths. significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century; however, the likelihood, timing, and severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted. a significant pandemic could have a major impact on the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system, food supply, consumption, overall economic output and, eventually, on the financial markets. in addition, a pandemic that affected our employees or the employees of our distributors or of other companies with which we do business could disrupt our business operations. the effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on the losses we experience. in our group insurance operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims. these events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
64
our property & casualty businesses have experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses that may have a material adverse impact on their business, results of operations and financial condition. although we make every effort to limit our exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not eliminate all risk. catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks. historically, most of our property & casualty catastrophe-related claims have related to homeowners coverages. however, catastrophes may also affect other property & casualty coverages. due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes. in addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods.
we have hurricane exposure in coastal sections of the northeastern u.s. (including lower new york, new jersey, connecticut, rhode island and massachusetts), the south atlantic states (including virginia, north carolina, south carolina, georgia and florida) and the gulf coast (including alabama, mississippi, louisiana and texas). we also have some earthquake exposure, primarily along the new madrid fault line in the central u.s. and in the pacific northwest.
consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. we cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. from time to time, states have passed legislation that has the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage risk, such as legislation restricting an insurer's ability to withdraw from catastrophe-prone areas. while we attempt to limit our exposure to acceptable levels, subject to restrictions imposed by insurance regulatory authorities, a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
most of the jurisdictions in which our u.s. insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business require life, health, and property & casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations. these associations are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers, who may become impaired, insolvent or fail, for example, following the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events. these associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. in addition, certain states have government owned or controlled organizations providing life, health, and property & casualty insurance to their citizens. the activities of such organizations could also place additional stress on the adequacy of guaranty fund assessments. many of these organizations also have the power to levy assessments similar to those of the guaranty associations described above. some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - insurance regulation - guaranty associations and similar arrangements" and "business - regulation - international regulation."
while in the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against metlife have not been material, it is possible that a large catastrophic event could render such guaranty funds inadequate and we may be called upon to contribute additional amounts, which may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in a particular period. we have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate, but additional liabilities may be necessary. see note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
our ability to manage this risk and the profitability of our property & casualty, health and life insurance businesses depends in part on our ability to obtain catastrophe reinsurance, which may not be available at commercially acceptable rates in the future. see "- reinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses."
our statutory life insurance reserve financings may be subject to cost increases and new financings may be subject to limited market capacity we currently utilize capital markets solutions to finance a portion of our statutory reserve requirements for several products, including, but not limited to, our level premium term life subject to the naic model regulation valuation of life insurance policies (commonly referred to as xxx), and universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees ("ulsg") subject to naic actuarial guideline 38 (commonly referred to as axxx), as well as mlic's closed block. while we have financing facilities in place for certain previously written business, certain of these facilities are subject to cost increases upon the occurrence of specified ratings downgrades of metlife or are subject to periodic re-pricing. any resulting cost increases could negatively impact our financial results.

future capacity for these statutory reserve funding structures in the marketplace is not guaranteed. currently, state insurance regulators and the naic are investigating the use of captive reinsurers and offshore entities to reinsure insurance risks. see "- regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth." insurance regulators in a few states, including new york and california, have imposed a moratorium on new reinsurance transactions between life insurers domiciled in those states and captive reinsurers. if additional state insurance regulators determine to restrict the use of captive reinsurers for purposes of funding reserve requirements or capacity in the capital markets otherwise becomes unavailable for a prolonged period of time, thereby hindering our ability to obtain funding for these new structures, our ability to continue the financing of our statutory reserve requirements for our previously written business in a cost effective manner may be impacted. after the separation, statutory life financing will be less of a risk factor, given our discontinuance of retail life sales.
competitive factors may adversely affect our market share and profitability we believe competition amongst insurance companies is based on a number of factors, including service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition. we compete globally with a large number of other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual consumers, employers and other group customers and agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. some of these companies offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability ratings. some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete. in some circumstances, national banks that sell annuity products of life insurers may also have pre-existing customer bases for financial services products. additionally, many of our group insurance products are underwritten annually. there is a risk that group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors than they could renewing coverage with us. these competitive pressures may adversely affect the persistency of these and other products, as well as our ability to sell our products in the future. furthermore, the investment management and securities brokerage businesses have relatively few barriers to entry and continually attract new entrants. see "business - competition."
the insurance industry distributes many of its individual products through other financial institutions such as banks and broker-dealers. an increase in bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity may negatively impact the industry's sales, and such consolidation could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market insurance products to our current customer base or to expand our customer base. consolidation of distributors and/or other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.
in addition, since numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation, legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment for our business may have, over time, the effect of supporting or burdening some aspects of the financial services industry more than others. this can affect our competitive position within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. see "business - regulation," "- regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth," and "- regulatory and legal risks - changes in u.s. federal, state securities and state insurance laws and regulations may affect our operations and our profitability."
if our business does not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or other long-lived assets or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition we perform our goodwill impairment testing using the fair value approach, which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the "reporting unit" level. a reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment under certain circumstances.
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business, which may be adversely impacted by prolonged market declines. if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. such writedowns could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - summary of critical accounting estimates - goodwill" and notes 1 and 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
long-lived assets, including assets such as real estate, also require impairment testing. this testing is done to determine whether changes in circumstances indicate that we will be unable to recover the carrying amount of the asset group. such writedowns could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
66
deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. factors in management's determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate future taxable income. if, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. in addition, changes in the corporate tax rates could affect the value of our deferred tax assets and may require a write-off of some of those assets. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - summary of critical accounting estimates - income taxes."
if our business does not perform well or if actual experience versus estimates used in valuing and amortizing dac, deferred sales inducements ("dsi") and voba vary significantly, we may be required to accelerate the amortization and/or impair the dac, dsi and voba which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance business are deferred and referred to as dac. bonus amounts credited to certain policyholders, either immediately upon receiving a deposit or as excess interest credits for a period of time, are deferred and referred to as dsi. voba represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in-force at the acquisition date. the estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on actuarially determined projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. dac, dsi and voba related to fixed and variable universal life and deferred annuity contracts are amortized in proportion to actual and expected future gross profits and for most participating contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross margins. the amount of future gross profit or margin is dependent principally on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such as inflation. of these factors, we anticipate that investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of dac for the aforementioned contracts.
if actual gross profits or margins are less than originally expected, then the amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the period the actual experience is known and would result in a charge to net income. significant or sustained equity market declines could result in an acceleration of amortization of dac, dsi and voba related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to net income. such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - industry trends - impact of a sustained low interest rate environment" for a discussion of how significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period.
see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - summary of critical accounting estimates - deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired" and note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further consideration of dac and voba.
guarantees within certain of our products may decrease our earnings, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased counterparty risk certain of our variable annuity products include guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed minimum death benefits ("gmdbs"), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits ("gmwbs"), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits ("gmabs"), and guaranteed minimum income benefits ("gmibs"). certain of our interest rate sensitive products include a minimum crediting rate feature which could be guaranteed for a period of time or life time of the policies. these guarantees are designed to protect policyholders against significant downturns in equity markets and interest rates. any such periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of our liabilities associated with those products. an increase in these liabilities would result in a decrease in our net income.
we use derivatives and other risk management strategies to hedge the economic exposure inherent in these liabilities. these economically effective hedges do not always qualify for hedge accounting treatment, and, as result, such non-qualifying derivatives may introduce volatility in the results of our operations, including net income, to the extent the financial measurement of the hedged liability does not fully reflect the sensitivity to the underlying economic exposure.
67
we also use derivatives and other risk management strategies to directly mitigate the volatility in net income associated with certain of these liabilities that are measured at fair value. these strategies involve the use of reinsurance and derivatives, which may not be completely effective. for example, in the event that reinsurers, derivative counterparties or central clearinghouses are unable or unwilling to pay, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits. see "- if the counterparties to our reinsurance or indemnification arrangements or to the derivatives we use to hedge our business risks default or fail to perform, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations."
in addition, hedging instruments may not effectively offset the costs of guarantees or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. furthermore, we are subject to the risk that changes in policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produce economic losses not addressed by the risk management techniques employed. these, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including net income, capitalization, financial condition or liquidity, including our ability to receive dividends from our operating insurance companies. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - policyholder liabilities - variable annuity guarantees" and note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further consideration of the risks associated with guaranteed benefits.
capital-related risks legal and regulatory restrictions and uncertainty and restrictions under the terms of certain of our securities may prevent us from repurchasing our stock and paying dividends at the level we wish the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by metlife, inc.'s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the board. there is no requirement or assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. if metlife, inc.'s designation as a non-bank sifi is reinstated, we also may be subject to restrictions arising from federal reserve regulation, including capital planning and stress testing requirements. the capital requirements that will apply to non-bank sifis are unclear. furthermore, if additional capital requirements are imposed on metlife, inc. as a g-sii, its ability to pay dividends could be reduced by any such additional capital requirements that might be imposed. see "- regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth."
in addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock is subject to restrictions under the terms of our preferred stock, junior subordinated debentures and trust securities. these instruments have so called "dividend stopper" provisions for situations where we may be experiencing financial stress. "junior subordinated debentures" include metlife's fixed-to-floating exchangeable surplus trust securities, which are exchangeable for junior subordinated debentures, and which contain terms with the same substantive effects for these purposes as do the terms of metlife, inc.'s junior subordinated debentures. in addition, our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock and interest on our junior subordinated debentures is also restricted by the terms of those securities.
we may also be restricted from time to time in our ability to repurchase shares or to enter into share repurchase programs under rule 10b5-1 of the exchange act. that rule requires, among other things, that we establish any share repurchase program in good faith at a time when we are not aware of any material non-public information in order for us to have an affirmative defense against accusations of insider trading. therefore, we may be unable to repurchase shares or to enter into share repurchase programs during various periods of time, including periods of significant corporate reorganization such as a spin-off or a sale of a substantial portion of the company.
regulatory restrictions metlife, inc. may not be able to pay dividends if it does not receive sufficient funds from its operating subsidiaries, which are themselves subject to separate regulatory restrictions on their ability to pay dividends. see "- as a holding company, metlife, inc. depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, a major component of holding company free cash flow." our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect our capital may also be affected if metlife, inc. is reinstated as a non-bank sifi or if restrictions applicable to g-siis are imposed upon us. see "- regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth," "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - potential regulation as a non-bank sifi" and "business - regulation - international regulation - global systemically important insurers."
68
"dividend stopper" provisions in our preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures certain terms of our preferred stock and our junior subordinated debentures may prevent us from repurchasing our common stock or paying dividends on our common stock in certain circumstances. metlife, inc. also has entered into certain replacement capital covenants. these covenants limit our ability to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of preferred stock or junior subordinated debentures by requiring metlife, with some limitations, to receive cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities prior to any repayment, redemption or purchase. see note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of such covenants in effect with respect to junior subordinated debentures.
if we have not paid the full dividends on our preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period, we may not repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock during a dividend period. under our junior subordinated debentures, if we have not paid in full the accrued interest through the most recent interest payment date on our junior subordinated debentures, we may not repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock or other capital stock (including the preferred stock), subject to certain exceptions.
trigger events for the restrictions on the payment of dividends on our preferred stock and restrictions on the payment of interest on our junior subordinated debentures in addition, the preferred stock and the junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would automatically suspend the payment of preferred stock dividends and interest on junior subordinated debentures if metlife, inc. fails to meet certain tests ("trigger events"). in such cases, and subject to the terms of the instruments, metlife, inc. could make payments up to the amount of net proceeds from sales of (i) common stock during the 90 days preceding the dividend declaration date or (ii) common stock or certain kinds of warrants to purchase common stock generally during the 180 days prior to the interest payment date (the "new equity proceeds").
a "trigger event" would occur if:
•   the rbc ratio of metlife's largest u.s. insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate (as defined in the applicable instrument) were to be less than 175% of the company action level based on the subsidiaries' prior year annual financial statements filed (generally around march 1) with state insurance commissioners; or
•   at the end of a quarter ("final quarter end test date"), consolidated gaap net income for the four-quarter period ending two quarters before such quarter-end (the "preliminary quarter end test date") is zero or a negative amount and the consolidated gaap stockholders' equity, minus aoci (the "adjusted stockholders' equity amount"), as of the final quarter end test date and the preliminary quarter end test date, declined by 10% or more from its level 10 quarters before the final quarter end test date (the "benchmark quarter end test date").
the trigger event would continue until there is no longer a trigger event at the specified time, and the adjusted stockholders' equity amount is no longer 10% or more below its level at each benchmark quarter end test date that is associated with a "trigger event."
we currently expect that, when we separate brighthouse financial, our adjusted stockholders' equity amount will decline by at least 10% in the quarter of the separation. the adjusted stockholders' equity amount on the preliminary quarter end test date at the end of that quarter, and seven subsequent quarters, will be at least 10% less than the amount on the applicable benchmark quarter end test date (in the absence of some other increase in the adjusted stockholders' equity amount). if, on any of those preliminary quarter end test dates, four quarter consolidated gaap net income is zero or less, a "trigger event" would occur unless, prior to the corresponding final quarter end test date, the adjusted stockholders' equity amount is greater than 90% of the amount of the adjusted stockholders' equity on the benchmark quarter end test date.
after a trigger event, we would only be permitted to pay dividends on the preferred stock and interest on the junior subordinated debentures to the extent the new equity proceeds were sufficient to do so. in addition, if the new equity proceeds were insufficient to make such payments, the "dividend stopper" provisions would come into effect and we would be unable to repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock.
69
if, for example, we complete the separation in the third quarter of 2017 and the four quarter consolidated gaap net income is zero or less at the end of that quarter (the preliminary quarter end test date), a trigger event may occur that would restrict payments of dividends on the preferred stock and interest on the junior subordinated debentures beginning in the second quarter of 2018 after the final quarter end test date. in that case, we would have to suspend our dividend payments on, and repurchases of, our common stock, unless we could make payments in full on the preferred and the junior subordinated debentures, in each case, using the available applicable new equity proceeds. the payment restrictions on the preferred and junior subordinated debt instruments, and the restrictions on repurchases of and payments of dividends on common stock, could continue until there is no longer a trigger event and the adjusted stockholders' equity amount is greater than 90% of its level at the benchmark quarter end test date, which in this example would be the level at the end of the third quarter of 2015.
we are considering measures that would reduce or eliminate these potential risks. among other possibilities, we may seek to exclude the impact of the separation on shareholders' equity for purposes of the restrictions on payments of dividends and interest in respect of the preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures, respectively. however, there can be no assurance we will take these or any other mitigating actions.
dividends on our preferred stock are subject to declaration by our board of directors in addition, dividends on our preferred stock are subject to declaration each quarter by our board of directors. if our board of directors does not declare dividends on the preferred stock for any quarterly dividend period, the "dividend stopper" provisions in our preferred stock would prevent us from repurchasing or paying dividends on our common stock for that period.
optional deferral of interest on the junior subordinated debentures the junior subordinated debentures provide that we may, at our option and provided that certain conditions are met, defer payment of interest without giving rise to an event of default for periods of up to 10 years. in that case, after five years metlife, inc. would be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell equity securities to raise proceeds to pay the interest. we would not be subject to limitations on the number of deferral periods that we could begin, so long as all accrued and unpaid interest is paid with respect to prior deferral periods. if we were to defer payments of interest, the "dividend stopper" provisions in the junior subordinated debentures would thus prevent us from repurchasing or paying dividends on our common stock or other capital stock (including the preferred stock) during the period of deferral, subject to exceptions.
see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these restrictions.
as a holding company, metlife, inc. depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends, a major component of holding company free cash flow metlife, inc. is a holding company for its insurance and financial subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. dividends from its subsidiaries and permitted payments to it under its tax sharing agreement with its subsidiaries are its principal sources of cash to meet its obligations and to pay preferred and common stock dividends. if the cash metlife, inc. receives from its subsidiaries is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, metlife, inc. may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets.
dividends that metlife, inc. expects to receive from brighthouse and other companies in connection with the separation are subject to contingencies that include investor interest, ratings actions, and the macroeconomic environment, among others. these contingencies may affect brighthouse's ability to incur debt to pay a portion of these dividends and otherwise affect those companies' ability to pay these dividends.
the payment of dividends and other distributions to metlife, inc. by its u.s. insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations. in general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits require insurance regulatory approval. in addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of dividends or other payments by its insurance subsidiaries to metlife, inc. if they determine that the payment could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. the payment of dividends and other distributions by insurance companies is also influenced by business conditions and rating agency considerations. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - insurance regulation" and "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - metlife, inc. - liquidity and capital sources - dividends from subsidiaries." see also "- regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth."
70
any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our foreign subsidiaries and branches to metlife, inc. could be subject to taxation, insurance regulatory or other restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdiction in which such foreign subsidiaries operate. see "business - regulation - international regulation" and "- risks related to our business - our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks, including exposure to local and regional economic conditions, that could negatively affect those operations or our profitability."
from time to time, metlife, inc. or its subsidiaries may establish net worth maintenance or other support agreements with other subsidiaries. those commitments may limit such supported subsidiary's ability to pay metlife, inc. dividends, or require metlife, inc. or another subsidiary to transfer capital to such supported subsidiary, in either case limiting capital that is available for other purposes. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - metlife, inc. - liquidity and capital uses - support agreements."
dividends from operating subsidiaries are a major component of holding company free cash flow. see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - non-gaap and other financial disclosures." if metlife, inc.'s operating subsidiaries were unable to make expected dividend payments to metlife, inc., we may be unable to meet our free cash flow goals and our ability to distribute cash to shareholders could be adversely affected.
operational risks our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business our enterprise risk management program is designed to mitigate material risks and loss to the company. we have developed and continue to develop our risk management policies and procedures to reflect the ongoing review of our risks and expect to continue to do so in the future. nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not be comprehensive and may not identify every risk to which we are exposed. many of our methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior to model or project potential future exposure.
models used by our business are based on assumptions and projections which may be inaccurate. business decisions based on incorrect or misused model output and reports could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. model risk may be the result of a model being misspecified for its intended purpose, being misused or producing incorrect or inappropriate results. models used by our business may not operate properly and could contain errors related to model inputs, data, assumptions, calculations, or output. we perform model validations which are conducted by experienced professionals with the requisite authority and technical ability to effectively challenge the models. the ongoing model validation process could give rise to adjustments to models that may adversely impact our results of operations. as a result, these methods may not fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly greater than our historical measures indicate.
other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. this information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. furthermore, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will follow our risk management policies and procedures, nor can there be any assurance that our risk management policies and procedures will enable us to accurately identify all risks and limit our exposures based on our assessments. in addition, we may have to implement more extensive and perhaps different risk management policies and procedures under pending regulations. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - potential regulation as a non-bank sifi," "business - regulation - international regulation - global systemically important insurers" and "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the level of claim losses we incur the continued threat of terrorism, both within the u.s. and abroad, ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. the value of assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism. companies in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of financial, commercial or economic disruptions and such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities or mortgage loans. terrorist actions also could disrupt our operations centers in the u.s. or abroad and result in higher than anticipated claims under our insurance policies. see "- economic environment and capital markets-related risks - if difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally persist, they may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations."
71
the failure in cyber- or other information security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning, could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation and impairment of our ability to conduct business effectively our business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems. we rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions, including processing claims, transactions and applications, providing information to customers and distributors, performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records. we also retain confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems and we rely on sophisticated technologies to maintain the security of that information. our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyberattacks or other computer-related penetrations. while, to date, metlife has not experienced a material breach of cybersecurity, administrative and technical controls and other preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems. in some cases, such physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches may not be immediately detected. this may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the availability and cost of insurance for operational and other risks relating to our business and systems may change and any such change may affect our results of operations.
in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, cyberattack or war, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial position, particularly if those problems affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data. in addition, in the event that a significant number of our managers, or employees generally, were unavailable following a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. these interruptions also may interfere with our suppliers' ability to provide goods and services and our employees' ability to perform their job responsibilities.
the failure of our computer systems and/or our disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and legal claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. although we conduct due diligence, negotiate contractual provisions and, in many cases, conduct periodic reviews of our vendors, distributors, and other third parties that provide operational or information technology services to us to confirm compliance with metlife's information security standards, the failure of such third parties' computer systems and/or their disaster recovery plans for any reason might cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to our customers. such a failure could harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and legal claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses. metlife, inc. and its subsidiaries maintain a primary cybersecurity and privacy liability insurance policy with a limit of $15 million, and have additional coverage for cybersecurity and privacy liability available under blended professional liability excess coverage policies with a total limit of $210 million. there can be no assurance that our information security policies and systems in place can prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including nonpublic personal information.
72
any failure to protect the confidentiality of client information could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations pursuant to u.s. federal and state laws, and laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, various government agencies have established rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information. in addition, most u.s. states and a number of jurisdictions outside the united states, have enacted laws, which vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, to safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. many of our employees have access to, and routinely process, personal information of clients through a variety of media, including information technology systems. we rely on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information that is accessible to, or in the possession of, our company and our employees. it is possible that an employee could, intentionally or unintentionally, disclose or misappropriate confidential client information or our data could be the subject of a cybersecurity attack. if we fail to maintain adequate internal controls or if our employees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client information could occur. such internal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we analyze customer data to better manage our business. there has been increased scrutiny, including from u.s. state regulators, regarding the use of "big data" techniques such as price optimization. we cannot predict what, if any, actions may be taken with regard to "big data," but any inquiries could cause reputational harm and any limitations could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our associates may take excessive risks which could negatively affect our financial condition and business as an insurance enterprise, we are in the business of accepting certain risks. the associates who conduct our business, including executive officers and other members of management, sales managers, investment professionals, product managers, sales agents, wholesalers, underwriters, and other associates, do so in part by making decisions and choices that involve exposing us to risk. these include decisions such as setting underwriting guidelines and standards, product design and pricing, determining what assets to purchase for investment and when to sell them, which business opportunities to pursue, and other decisions. we endeavor, in the design and implementation of our compensation programs and practices, to avoid giving our associates incentives to take excessive risks; however, associates may take such risks regardless of the structure of our compensation programs and practices. similarly, although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor associates' business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks, and to prevent employee misconduct, these controls and procedures may not be effective. if our associates take excessive risks, the impact of those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations.
general risks metlife, inc.'s board of directors may influence the outcome of stockholder votes on many matters due to the voting provisions of the metlife policyholder trust under the plan, we established the metlife policyholder trust to hold the shares of metlife, inc. common stock allocated to eligible policyholders not receiving cash or policy credits under the plan. as of february 23, 2017, the trust held 162,077,300 shares, or 14.9%, of the outstanding shares of metlife, inc. common stock. because of voting provisions of the trust and the number of shares held by it, the trust may affect the outcome of matters brought to a stockholder vote. except on votes regarding certain fundamental corporate actions described below, the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held in the trust in accordance with the recommendations given by metlife, inc.'s board of directors to its stockholders or, if the board gives no such recommendations, as directed by the board. as a result of the voting provisions of the trust, the board of directors may be able to influence the outcome of votes on matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, excluding certain fundamental corporate actions, so long as the trust holds a substantial number of shares of common stock.
73
if the vote relates to fundamental corporate actions specified in the trust, the trustee will solicit instructions from the trust beneficiaries and vote all shares held in the trust in proportion to the instructions it receives. these actions include:
•   an election or removal of directors in which a stockholder has properly nominated one or more candidates in opposition to a nominee or nominees of metlife, inc.'s board of directors or a vote on a stockholder's proposal to oppose a board nominee for director, remove a director for cause or fill a vacancy caused by the removal of a director by stockholders, subject to certain conditions;
•   a merger or consolidation, a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets, or a recapitalization or dissolution, of metlife, inc., in each case requiring a vote of stockholders under applicable delaware law;
•   any transaction that would result in an exchange or conversion of shares of common stock held by the trust for cash, securities or other property; and
•   any proposal requiring metlife, inc.'s board of directors to amend or redeem the rights under metlife, inc.'s stockholder rights plan, other than a proposal with respect to which we have received advice of nationally-recognized legal counsel to the effect that the proposal is not a proper subject for stockholder action under delaware law. metlife, inc. does not currently have a stockholder rights plan.
if a vote concerns any of these fundamental corporate actions, the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held by the trust in proportion to the instructions it received, which will give disproportionate weight to the instructions actually given by trust beneficiaries.
the metlife policyholder trust agreement provides that we may terminate the trust once the percentage of outstanding shares held in the trust falls to 25%. the winding up of the trust must commence 90 days after we provide the trustee with notice that the percentage of outstanding shares held in the trust is 10% or less. in connection with any termination of the trust, all of the shares of common stock then held in the trust will need to be distributed to the respective trust beneficiaries, unless we offer to purchase all or a portion of such trust shares. in connection with the termination of the trust and such a distribution, we may incur costs related to regulatory filings, mailings to trust beneficiaries or others, and costs related to an increase in the number of shareholders, which may include increased mailing and proxy solicitation expenses. after such a distribution, the addition of the respective trust beneficiaries to our shareholder base with full voting rights may have a significant impact on matters brought to a stockholder vote and other aspects of our corporate governance.
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the financial accounting standards board (the "fasb"). the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our reports filed with the sec. see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and official positions of the fasb are determined only after extensive due process and deliberations. therefore, the effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. the required adoption of future accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
changes in our assumptions regarding the discount rate, expected rate of return, mortality rates and expected increase in compensation used for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability we determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on our best estimates of future plan experience. these assumptions are reviewed regularly and include discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and expected medical inflation. changes in these assumptions may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability. see note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on how changes in these assumptions would affect plan costs.

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims we rely on a combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. although we endeavor to protect our rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. this would represent a diversion of resources that may be significant and our efforts may not prove successful. the inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete with other insurers and financial institutions.
in addition, we may be subject to claims by third parties for (i) patent, trademark or copyright infringement, (ii) breach of patent, trademark or copyright license usage rights, or (iii) misappropriation of trade secrets. any such claims or resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages. if we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses. alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly alternative. any of these scenarios could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our distribution channels since the completion of the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture in july 2016, we primarily distribute our products through a variety of third-party distribution channels. we may periodically negotiate the terms of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. an interruption in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. a distributor has elected to suspend, and other distributors may elect to suspend, alter, reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us for various reasons, including uncertainty related to the proposed separation, changes in our distribution strategy, adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. we are also at risk that key distribution partners may merge, change their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, or that new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of our distribution efforts. an increase in bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market products through these channels. consolidation of distributors and/or other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.
when our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution despite our training and compliance programs. if our products are distributed by such firms in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, we may suffer reputational and other harm to our business.
state laws, federal laws, our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws may delay, deter or prevent takeovers and business combinations that stockholders might consider in their best interests state laws, federal laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests. for instance, such restrictions may prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of metlife, inc.'s common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of metlife, inc.'s common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.

any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would face various regulatory obstacles, including:
•   applicable state insurance laws and regulations may delay or impede a business combination involving us by prohibiting an entity from acquiring control (generally presumed to exist at direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of voting stock) of an insurance company domiciled in the united states without the prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have similar regulatory approval requirements.
•   if the acquiring entity is a bank or non-bank sifi, dodd-frank provisions that restrict or impede consolidations, mergers and acquisitions by systemically significant firms. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - potential regulation as a non-bank sifi - enhanced prudential standards for non-bank sifis."
•   provisions of the investment company act that require approval by the contract owners of our variable contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of any affiliated investment adviser to a mutual fund underlying our variable contracts.
•   finra approval requirements for a change of control of any finra registered broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of metlife, inc.
•   provisions of the delaware general corporation law may affect the ability of an "interested stockholder" (the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation) to engage in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an "interested stockholder."
in addition, metlife, inc.'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests or may otherwise adversely affect prevailing market prices for metlife, inc.'s common stock. these provisions include: a prohibition on the calling of special meetings or action by written consent by stockholders; and advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates to the board of directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings.
a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors may amend metlife, inc.'s certificate of incorporation or by-laws. this may allow shareholders to change the company's corporate governance and, therefore, make it more difficult for the board of directors to protect shareholders' interests, e.g., if they are presented with an acquisition proposal that undervalues the company.

forward-looking statements and other financial information for purposes of this discussion, "metlife," the "company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to metlife, inc., a delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. following this summary is a discussion addressing the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company for the periods indicated. this discussion should be read in conjunction with "note regarding forward-looking statements," "risk factors," "selected financial data," "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" and the company's consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.
this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may contain or incorporate by reference information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future events. these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. they use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. in particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. see "note regarding forward-looking statements."
this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes references to our performance measures, operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders, that are not based on gaap. these measures are used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. consistent with gaap guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is also our gaap measure of segment performance. operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings are also the measures by which senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results. forward-looking guidance provided on a non-gaap basis cannot be reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap measures on a forward-looking basis because net income may fluctuate significantly if net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses move outside of estimated ranges. see "- non-gaap and other financial disclosures" for definitions and a discussion of these measures, and "- results of operations" for reconciliations of historical non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures.

executive summary overview metlife is a global provider of life insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. metlife is organized into six segments: u.s.; asia; latin america; emea, metlife holdings; and brighthouse financial. in addition, the company reports certain of its results of operations in corporate & other. see "- other key information," "business - segments and corporate & other" and note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company's segments and corporate & other. management continues to evaluate the company's segment performance and allocated resources and may adjust related measurements in the future to better reflect segment profitability.
current year highlights during the year ended december 31, 2016, overall sales increased slightly as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, reflecting an increase in sales of our retirement and income solutions products, offset by declines in our life and annuity products. we experienced a significant amount of derivative losses in 2016, primarily as a result of our annual actuarial assumption review. asymmetrical and non-economic accounting also resulted from derivative losses on non-qualifying hedges, driven by changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and equity markets. in addition, while positive net flows drove an increase in our investment portfolio, yields declined as a result of low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency fluctuations. our results for 2016 also reflect a write-off of dac and an increase in our insurance-related liabilities due to loss recognition testing upon re-segmentation, unfavorable reserve adjustments resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process, and charges related to goodwill impairment.
the following represents segment level results and percentage contributions to total segment level operating earnings for the year ended december 31, 2016:
_______________
(1) excludes corporate & other.
(2) consistent with gaap guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is our gaap measure of segment performance. see "- non-gaap and other financial disclosures."

consolidated company outlook the proposed separation and the completion of our u.s retail advisor force divestiture evidence our commitment to accelerating value and our refreshed enterprise strategy, the center of which is still one metlife. digital and simplified are the key enablers of our strategic initiatives which include (i) optimizing value and risk by prioritizing businesses with high internal rates of return, lower capital intensity, and maximum cash generation, (ii) driving operational excellence, by becoming a high-performance operating company with a competitive cost structure, (iii) transforming our distribution channels to drive efficiency and productivity through digital enablement and improved customer persistency, and (iv) undertaking a targeted approach to find the right solutions for the right customers through the commitment to creating differentiated customer value propositions. this new enterprise strategy will enhance our ability to focus on the right markets, build clear differentiators, and continue to make the right investments to deliver shareholder value.
in 2017, we will focus on executing the separation and making critical investments to drive efficiency. while this will put downward pressure on operating earnings in 2017, we expect post-separation metlife operating earnings to grow in 2018 driven by both business growth and expense discipline. following the separation, metlife will also be significantly less sensitive to interest rates. notably, the separation will also make metlife a more globally diversified company; we expect metlife will generate over 40% of its operating earnings from outside the united states and that percentage should continue to grow over time.
we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in a number of separation-related transactions that will impact our holding companies' liquid assets. in 2016, we incurred $2.3 billion of separation-related items which reduced our holding companies' liquid assets, as well as our free cash flow. these separation-related items consisted of separation-related outflows comprised of an incremental capital contribution to metlife usa, capital contributions to brighthouse subsidiaries and separation-related costs, forgone subsidiary dividends from metlife usa and forgone incremental debt at metlife, inc., net of separation-related inflows comprised of incremental subsidiary dividends from nelico and metlife usa. however, we have increased and expect to continue to increase our holding companies' liquid assets over time as a result of (i) $291 million in cash proceeds that we received in 2016 from the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture; (ii) dividends in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion that we expect to receive in 2017 from brighthouse (which may be partially funded by the issuance of debt by brighthouse) and a metlife-affiliated reinsurance company prior to the separation; and (iii) proceeds from the disposition of our retained shares of brighthouse common stock that we expect to receive over time. in addition to these separation-related items, we expect to have cash commitments of between $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion over the two-year period of 2017 and 2018 relating to liability management transactions, including the repayment of certain debt maturities. following the separation, we plan to maintain a liquidity buffer of $3.0 to $4.0 billion of liquid assets at the holding companies. see "risk factors - risks related to acquisitions, dispositions or other structural changes - we may not complete the separation of brighthouse financial on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all" and "risk factors - capital-related risks - legal and regulatory restrictions and uncertainty and restrictions under the terms of certain of our securities may prevent us from repurchasing our stock and paying dividends at the level we wish."
assuming interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves as of december 31, 2016, we expect the average ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings over the two-year period of 2017 and 2018, excluding the impact of the separation, to be 65% to 75%. this expectation reflects our unit cost improvement program and the related initiative to invest $1 billion by 2020 to generate $800 million pre-tax run rate annual savings, net of stranded overhead. we believe that free cash flow is a key determinant of dividends and share repurchases.
when making these and other projections, we must rely on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties. our assumptions have been and will continue to be impacted by (i) metlife, inc.'s plan to pursue the separation, (ii) regulatory uncertainty regarding capital requirements that would have been applicable to metlife, inc. as a result of the fsoc's former designation of metlife, inc. as a non-bank sifi, which, among other things, impacted the level of our share repurchases, (iii) lower investment margins (primarily in the united states) as a result of the sustained low interest rate environment, (iv) lower than anticipated merger and acquisition activity, and (v) the effect on our foreign operations of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar. see "- other key information - significant events" for information regarding the separation, u.s. retail advisor force divestiture, and the status of court proceedings relating to metlife, inc.'s challenge to the fsoc's former designation of it as a non-bank sifi.

other key information basis of presentation prior to january 1, 2016, certain international subsidiaries had a fiscal year cutoff of november 30th. accordingly, the company's consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries as of november 30, 2015 and the operating results of such subsidiaries for the years ended november 30, 2015 and 2014. effective january 1, 2016, the company converted its japan operations to calendar year-end reporting. the elimination of a one-month reporting lag of a subsidiary is considered a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application. while the company believes that eliminating the lag in the reporting of its japan operations was preferable in order to consistently reflect events, economic conditions and global trends on the financial statements, the company determined that it was impracticable to apply the effects of the lag elimination to financial reporting periods prior to january 1, 2015. the effect of not retroactively applying this change in accounting, however, was not material to the 2015 or 2016 consolidated financial statements. therefore, the company reported the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle in net income for the year ended december 31, 2016 and did not retrospectively apply the effects of this change to prior periods. see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
segment information based on the proposed separation, in the third quarter of 2016, the company reorganized its businesses. this re-segmentation resulted in a $340 million, net of income tax, charge to earnings in 2016, all in the brighthouse financial segment, driven by the segment's variable and universal life products. this charge is the direct result of the company, beginning in the third quarter, no longer being able to aggregate, for loss recognition testing, the variable and universal life products of the brighthouse financial segment with the variable and universal life products remaining in the metlife holdings segment. of this amount, the company recorded $254 million, net of income tax, as a charge in the third quarter of 2016, which was mostly recognized as a write-off of dac, with the remaining $86 million, net of income tax, recognized as an increase in insurance-related liabilities over the third and fourth quarters of 2016. we expect the ongoing impact to the brighthouse financial segment from the loss of the aggregation benefit to be approximately $40 million, net of income tax, per quarter, which began in the third quarter of 2016, gradually declining over time.
significant events on january 12, 2016, metlife, inc. announced its plan to pursue the separation. additionally, on july 21, 2016, metlife, inc. announced that following the separation, the separated business will be rebranded as "brighthouse financial." on october 5, 2016, brighthouse financial, inc., a subsidiary of metlife, inc. ("brighthouse"), filed a registration statement on form 10 (the "form 10") with the sec. on december 6, 2016, brighthouse filed an amendment to its registration statement on form 10 with the sec. the information statement filed as an exhibit to the form 10 disclosed that the company intends to include metlife usa, nelico, fmli, metlife advisers, llc and certain captive reinsurance companies in the proposed separated business and distribute at least 80.1% of the shares of brighthouse's common stock on a pro rata basis to the holders of metlife, inc. common stock. the ultimate form and timing of the separation will be influenced by a number of factors, including regulatory considerations and economic conditions. metlife continues to evaluate and pursue structural alternatives for the proposed separation. metlife expects that the life insurance closed block and the life and annuity business sold through mlic will not be a part of brighthouse financial. the separation remains subject to certain conditions including, among others, obtaining final approval from the metlife, inc. board of directors, receipt of a favorable ruling from the irs and an opinion from metlife's tax advisor regarding certain u.s. federal income tax matters, insurance and other regulatory approvals, and an sec declaration of the effectiveness of the form 10.
in july 2016, metlife, inc. completed the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture for $291 million. massmutual assumed all of the liabilities related to such assets that arise or occur at or after the closing of the sale. as part of the transactions, metlife, inc. and massmutual entered into a product development agreement under which metlife's u.s. retail business will be the exclusive developer of certain annuity products to be issued by massmutual. in the massmutual purchase agreement, metlife, inc. agreed to indemnify massmutual for certain claims, liabilities and breaches of representations and warranties up to limits described in the purchase agreement. see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

on december 18, 2014, the fsoc designated metlife, inc. as a non-bank sifi subject to regulation by the federal reserve and the fdic, as well as to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. on march 30, 2016, the d.c. district court ordered that the designation of metlife, inc. as a non-bank sifi by the fsoc be rescinded. on april 8, 2016, the fsoc appealed the d.c. district court's order to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia, and oral argument was heard on october 24, 2016. if the fsoc prevails on appeal or designates metlife, inc. as systemically important as part of its ongoing review of non-bank financial companies, metlife, inc. could once again be subject to regulation as a non-bank sifi. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - potential regulation as a non-bank sifi."
industry trends we continue to be impacted by the unstable global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry.
financial and economic environment our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. see "risk factors - economic environment and capital markets-related risks - we are exposed to significant global financial and capital markets risks which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause our net investment income to vary from period to period." the impact on global capital markets and the economy generally of the transition occurring in the united states government and the priorities of the trump administration is uncertain. see "risk factors - economic environment and capital markets-related risks - if difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally persist, they may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations."
we have market presence in numerous countries and increased exposure to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. see "risk factors - risks related to our business - our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks, including exposure to local and regional economic conditions, that could negatively affect those operations or our profitability." concerns about the political and/or economic stability in the u.k., italy, mexico, turkey and puerto rico have recently contributed to global market volatility. see "- investments - current environment - selected country investments." events following the u.k.'s referendum on june 23, 2016 and the uncertainties, including foreign currency exchange risks, associated with its pending withdrawal from the eu, have also contributed to market volatility, both in the u.s. and beyond. these factors could contribute to weakening gdp growth, primarily in the u.k. and europe. the magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts would depend on the detailed agreements reached by the u.k. and the eu as a result of the exit negotiations and negotiations regarding trade and other arrangements.
central banks around the world have used monetary policy to combat global market volatility. for example, the european central bank continues to institute support measures, including quantitative easing, to lessen the risk of deflation, lower borrowing costs in the euro zone and encourage corporations to issue more asset-backed securities. these measures, however, could affect the euro exchange rate and have uncertain impacts on interest rates and risk markets. in japan, the japanese government and the bank of japan have implemented a coordinated strategy which includes the imposition of a negative rate on commercial bank deposits, continued government bond purchases and tax reform, including the lowering of the japanese corporate tax rate and the delay until 2019 of an increase in the consumption tax to 10%. going forward, japan's structural and demographic challenges may continue to limit its potential growth unless reforms that boost productivity are put into place. japan's high public sector debt levels are mitigated by low refinancing risks and its nominal yields on government debt have remained at a lower level than that of any other developed country. however, frequent changes in government have prevented policy makers from implementing fiscal reform measures to put public finances on a sustainable path. for information regarding actions taken by the federal reserve board's federal open market committee ("fomc") in the united states, see " - impact of a sustained low interest rate environment."
impact of a sustained low interest rate environment as a global insurance company, we are affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world, as well as the monetary policy of the federal reserve board in the united states. the federal reserve board has taken a number of actions in recent years to spur economic activity, including asset purchases and keeping interest rates low. however, in december 2015, the fomc increased the federal funds rate for the first time in 10 years and raised it again at the december 2016 meeting. further increases in the federal funds rate in the future may affect interest rates and risk markets in the u.s. and other developed and emerging economies. however, we cannot predict with certainty the effect of these programs and policies on interest rates or the impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments at this time. see "- investments - current environment."

during periods of declining interest rates, we may have to invest insurance cash flows and reinvest the cash flows we received as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates. therefore, some of our products expose us to the risk that a reduction in interest rates will reduce the difference between the amounts that we are required to credit on contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on investments intended to support obligations under these contracts. this difference between interest earned and interest credited, or margin, is a key metric for the management of, and reporting for, many of our businesses.
our expectations regarding future margins are an important component impacting the amortization of certain intangible assets such as dac and voba. significantly lower margins may cause us to accelerate the amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. additionally, lower margins may also impact the recoverability of intangible assets such as goodwill, require the establishment of additional liabilities or trigger loss recognition events on certain policyholder liabilities. we review this long-term margin assumption, along with other assumptions, as part of our annual actuarial assumption review.
mitigating actions the company continues to be proactive in its investment and interest crediting rate strategies, as well as its product design and product mix. to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences from the low interest rate environment in the u.s., the company applies disciplined asset/liability management ("alm") strategies, including the use of interest rate derivatives. in some cases, the company has entered into offsetting positions as part of its overall alm strategy and to reduce volatility in net income. lowering interest crediting rates on some products, or adjusting the dividend scale on traditional products, can help offset decreases in investment margins on some products. our ability to lower interest crediting rates could be limited by competition, requirements to obtain regulatory approval, or contractual guarantees of minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. as a result, our margins could decrease or potentially become negative. we are able to limit or close certain products to new sales in order to manage exposures. business actions, such as shifting the sales focus to less interest rate sensitive products, can also mitigate this risk. in addition, the company is well diversified across product, distribution, and geography. certain of our non-u.s. businesses, reported within our latin america, emea, and asia (exclusive of our japan business) segments, which accounted for approximately 19% of our operating earnings in 2016, are not significantly interest rate or market sensitive; in particular, they do not have any direct sensitivity to u.s. interest rates. the company's primary exposure within these segments is insurance risk. we expect our non-u.s. businesses to grow faster than our u.s. businesses and, over time, to become a larger percentage of our total business. as a result of the foregoing, the company expects to be able to substantially mitigate the negative impact of a sustained low interest rate environment in the u.s. on the company's profitability. based on a near to intermediate term analysis of a sustained lower interest rate environment in the u.s., the company anticipates operating earnings will continue to increase, although at a slower growth rate.
low interest rate scenario in formulating economic assumptions for its insurance contract assumptions, the company uses projections that it makes regarding interest rates. included in these assumptions is the projection that the 10-year treasury rate will rise from 2.45% at december 31, 2016 to 4.25% in 10 years, by 2026 and that 10-year yields will reach 2.73%, 2.93% and 3.08% by december 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. also included is the projection that the three-month libor rate will move from 1.00% at december 31, 2016 to 1.55%, 1.95% and 2.22% by december 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. the low interest rate scenario reflects an assumed constant 10-year treasury rate of 1.50% and a constant three-month libor rate of 0.65%, with the corresponding consensus of interest rate views and credit spreads (the "low interest rate scenario").
the following summarizes the impact of the low interest rate scenario on our u.s. dollar and non-u.s. dollar denominated positions. in addition, we have included disclosure on the potential impact on 2017, 2018 and 2019 net income using the same low interest rate scenario on the mark-to-market of derivative positions that do not qualify as accounting hedges.

the low interest rate scenario assumes three-month libor to be 0.65% and the 10-year u.s. treasury rate to be 1.50% at december 31, 2016 and remain constant at those levels until december 31, 2019. we make similar assumptions for interest rates at other maturities, and hold this interest rate curve constant through december 31, 2019. in addition, in the low interest rate scenario, we assume credit spreads remain constant from december 2016 through the end of 2019 as compared to our business plan which assumes rising credit spreads through 2017 and thereafter remaining constant through the end of 2019. further, we also include the impact of low interest rates on our pension and postretirement plan expenses. we allocate this impact across our segments and it is included in the segment discussion below. the discount rate used to value these plans is tied to high quality corporate bond yields. accordingly, an extended low interest rate environment will result in increased pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. however, these liabilities are offset by corresponding returns on the fixed income portfolio of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets resulting in an overall decrease in expense.
hypothetical impact to operating earnings based on the above assumptions, we estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on our consolidated operating earnings from the low interest rate scenario of approximately $65 million in 2017, $120 million in 2018 and $210 million in 2019. under the low interest rate scenario, our long-term businesses are negatively impacted by the larger gap between new money yields and the yield on assets rolling off the portfolio. however, there are positive offsets under the low interest rate scenario as short-term rates are much lower than the business plan rates and the yield curve is steeper than that of the business plan. for example, our securities lending business performs better than our business plan because it is driven by the slope of the yield curve rather than by the level of interest rates. in addition, derivative income is higher primarily due to our receiver swaps where we receive a fixed rate and pay a floating rate.
hypothetical impact to our mark-to-market derivative positions in addition to its impact on operating earnings, we estimated the effect of the low interest rate scenario on the mark-to-market of our derivative positions that do not qualify as accounting hedges. we applied the low interest rate scenario to these derivatives and compared the impact to that from interest rates in our business plan. we hold a significant position in long-duration receive-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge reinvestment risk. these swaps are most sensitive to the 30-year and 10-year swap rates and we recognize gains as rates drop and recognize losses as rates rise. this estimated impact on the derivative mark-to-market does not include that of our va program derivatives as the impact of low interest rates in the freestanding derivatives would be largely offset by the mark-to-market in net derivative gains (losses) for the related embedded derivative.
based on these additional assumptions, we estimate the combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact of the low interest rate scenario on the mark-to-market of our derivative positions that do not qualify as accounting hedges to be an increase in net income of $140 million in 2017, $145 million in 2018 and $80 million in 2019. see "- results of operations - consolidated results" for information regarding our actual gains and losses on the company's non-va program derivatives due to interest rate changes which are included in net income.
segments and corporate & other the following discussion summarizes the impact of the above low interest rate scenario on the operating earnings of our segments, as well as corporate & other. see also "- policyholder liabilities - policyholder account balances" for information regarding the account values subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates.

u.s.
group benefits in general, most of our group life insurance products in the u.s. segment are renewable term insurance and, therefore, have significant repricing flexibility. interest rate risk arises mainly from minimum interest rate guarantees on retained asset accounts. these accounts have minimum interest crediting rate guarantees which range from 0.5% to 3.0%. all of these account balances are currently at their respective minimum interest crediting rates and we would expect to experience margin compression as we reinvest at lower interest rates. we have used interest rate derivatives to partially mitigate the risks of a sustained u.s. low interest rate environment. we also have exposure to interest rate risk in this business arising from our disability policy claim reserves. for these products, lower reinvestment rates cannot be offset by a reduction in liability crediting rates for established claim reserves. group disability policies are generally renewable term policies. rates may be adjusted on in-force policies at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and current interest rate assumptions.
we estimate a favorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on the operating earnings of our group benefits business from the low interest rate scenario of $5 million, $15 million and $20 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
retirement and income solutions retirement and income solutions contains both short and long-duration products consisting of capital market products, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products. the majority of short- duration products are managed on a floating rate basis, which mitigates the impact of the low interest rate environment in the u.s. the long-duration products have very predictable cash flows and we have matched these cash flows through our alm strategies. we also use interest rate swaps to help protect income in this segment against a low interest rate environment in the u.s. based on the cash flow estimates, only a small component is subject to reinvestment risk. reinvestment risk is defined for this purpose as the amount of reinvestment in 2017, 2018 and 2019 that would impact operating earnings due to reinvesting cash flows in the low interest rate scenario. for the long-duration business, $0.1 billion of the asset base in 2017 will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $52.4 billion. in 2018 and 2019, none of the asset base will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $54.0 billion and $54.7 billion, respectively.
we estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on operating earnings on our retirement and income solutions business from the low interest rate scenario of $35 million, $65 million and $35 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
property & casualty the product portfolio within property & casualty is primarily made up of six-month and annual term renewable policies, which allow for significant re-pricing flexibility with no policyholder benefits tied to interest rates. as a result, the interest rate risk for the property & casualty business is minimal, tied only to our portfolio reinvestment rates and our ability to offset the change of those rates through re-pricing efforts.
we estimate a combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on operating earnings on our property and casualty business from the low interest rate scenario not to be material in 2017, and an unfavorable impact of $5 million and $10 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
asia our japan business offers traditional life insurance and accident & health products. to the extent the japan life insurance portfolio is u.s. interest rate and libor sensitive and we are unable to lower crediting rates to the customer, operating earnings will decline. we manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and alm strategies.
we sell annuities in japan which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set at the time of issue. this allows us to tightly manage product alm, cash flows and net spreads, thus maintaining profitability.
we estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on the operating earnings of our asia segment from the low interest rate scenario of $25 million, $65 million and $120 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
93
metlife holdings our interest rate sensitive life products include traditional and universal life products. because the majority of our traditional life insurance business is participating, we can largely offset lower investment returns on assets backing our traditional life products through adjustments to the applicable dividend scale. in our universal life products, we manage interest rate risk through a combination of product design features and alm strategies, including the use of interest rate derivative hedges. while we have the ability to lower crediting rates on certain in-force universal life policies to mitigate margin compression, such actions would be partially offset by increases in our liabilities related to policies with secondary guarantees.
in annuities, the impact on operating earnings from margin compression is concentrated in our deferred annuities where there are minimum interest rate guarantees. under the low interest rate scenario, we assume that a larger percentage of customers will maintain their funds with us to take advantage of the attractive minimum guaranteed crediting rates and we expect to experience margin compression as we reinvest cash flows at lower interest rates. partially offsetting this margin compression, we assume we will lower crediting rates on contractual reset dates for the portion of business that is not currently at minimum crediting rates. additionally, we have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate this risk.
long-term care and retained assets accounts are interest rate sensitive. long-term care reserves have exposure to lower reinvestment rates that cannot be offset by a reduction in liability crediting rates for established claim reserves. long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience. our long-term care block is closed to new business. we review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long-term disability claim reserves no less frequently than annually and, with respect to interest rates, we set the discount rate on these reserves based on the prevailing interest rate environment at the time. our retained asset accounts have minimum interest crediting rate guarantees which range from 0.5% to 4.0%, all of which are currently at their respective minimum interest crediting rates. while we expect to experience margin compression as we reinvest at lower rates, the interest rate derivatives held in this portfolio should partially mitigate this risk.
reinvestment risk is defined for this purpose as the amount of reinvestment in 2017, 2018 and 2019 that would impact operating earnings due to reinvesting cash flows in the low interest rate scenario. for the life business, $3.3 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, of the asset base will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $61.1 billion, $60.9 billion and $60.6 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. for our deferred annuities business, $1.3 billion, $0.8 billion, and $1.0 billion in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, of the asset base will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $18.1 billion, $17.8 billion and $17.4 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. for our long-term care portfolio, $0.7 billion, $0.5 billion and $0.5 billion of the asset base in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $11.3 billion, $12.1 billion and $12.7 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
we estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on the operating earnings of our metlife holdings segment from the low interest rate scenario of $10 million, $25 million and $50 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
brighthouse financial our interest rate sensitive products include deferred annuities and universal life products. in our universal life products, we manage interest rate risk through a combination of product design features and alm strategies, including the use of interest rate derivatives. while we have the ability to lower crediting rates on certain in-force universal life policies to mitigate margin compression, such actions would be partially offset by increases in our liabilities related to policies with secondary guarantees.
the impact on operating earnings from margin compression is concentrated in our fixed deferred annuities, as well as the fixed account allocations in our variable annuities, where there are minimum interest rate guarantees. under the low interest rate scenario, we assume that a larger percentage of customers will maintain their funds with us to take advantage of the attractive minimum guaranteed crediting rates and we expect to experience margin compression as we reinvest cash flows at lower interest rates. partially offsetting this margin compression, we assume we will lower crediting rates on contractual reset dates for the portion of business that is not currently at minimum crediting rates. additionally, we have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate this risk.
94
reinvestment risk is defined for this purpose as the amount of reinvestment in 2017, 2018 and 2019 that would impact operating earnings due to reinvesting cash flows in the low interest rate scenario. for the deferred annuities business, $1.2 billion, $0.6 billion, and $1.0 billion in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, of the asset base will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of $22.6 billion, $24.5 billion and $26.4 billion in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
we estimate a favorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on operating earnings on our brighthouse financial segment from the low interest rate scenario of $30 million and $5 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively and an unfavorable impact of $45 million in 2019.
additionally, we have mark-to-market interest rate risk in our variable annuity guarantees, where reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of our liabilities associated with these products. because this risk is largely hedged, we have not included the impact of such interest rate risk in the foregoing estimates.
corporate & other corporate & other contains the surplus portfolios for the enterprise, the portfolios used to fund the capital needs of the company and various reinsurance agreements. the surplus portfolios are subject to reinvestment risk; however, lower net investment income is significantly offset by lower interest expense on both fixed and variable rate debt. under a lower interest rate environment, fixed rate debt is assumed to be either paid off when it matures or refinanced at a lower interest rate resulting in lower overall interest expense. variable rate debt is indexed to the three-month libor, which results in lower interest expense incurred.
we estimate an unfavorable combined long-term and short-term interest rate impact on the operating earnings of corporate & other from the low interest rate scenario of $30 million in 2017 and a favorable impact of $20 million and $30 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
competitive pressures the life insurance industry remains highly competitive. the product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments, leading to more intense competition with respect to product features. larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology and risk management, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. in addition, several of the industry's products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. sufficient scale, financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. we believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets, its impact on the capital position of many competitors, and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have altered the competitive environment. in particular, we believe that these factors have highlighted financial strength as the most significant differentiator and, as a result, we believe the company is well positioned to compete in this environment.
regulatory developments in the united states, our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. as life insurers introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry. regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry. in addition, regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities, variable annuities and group products, as well as reviews of the utilization of affiliated captive reinsurers and offshore entities to reinsure insurance risks.
95
the regulation of the global financial services industry has received renewed scrutiny as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets. significant regulatory reforms have been adopted and additional reforms proposed, and these or other reforms could be implemented. see "business - regulation," "risk factors - regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth," "risk factors - risks related to our business - our statutory life insurance reserve financings may be subject to cost increases and new financings may be subject to limited market capacity," and "risk factors - regulatory and legal risks - changes in u.s. federal, state securities and state insurance laws and regulations may affect our operations and our profitability." for example, dodd-frank effected the most far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation in the united states in decades. the full impact of dodd-frank on us will depend on whether metlife, inc. again becomes subject to supervision and regulation as a non-bank sifi, as well as the adoption and implementation of final rules for insurance non-bank sifis required or permitted by dodd-frank, a number of which remain to be completed. see "risk factors - regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth" for information regarding the proposal by president trump and the majority party to dismantle or roll back dodd-frank and the related executive order calling for a comprehensive review of dodd-frank.
mortgage and foreclosure-related exposures metlife no longer engages in the origination, sale and servicing of forward and reverse residential mortgage loans. see note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our mortgage and foreclosure-related exposures.
notwithstanding metlife bank's exit from the origination and servicing businesses, mlhl remains obligated to repurchase loans or compensate for losses upon demand due to alleged defects by metlife bank or its predecessor servicers in past servicing of the loans and material representations made in connection with metlife bank's sale of the loans. reserves for representation and warranty repurchases and indemnifications were $34 million and $72 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. reserves for estimated future losses due to alleged deficiencies on loans originated and sold, as well as servicing of the loans including servicing acquired, are estimated based on unresolved claims and projected losses under investor servicing contracts where metlife bank's past actions or inactions are likely to result in missing certain stipulated investor timelines. reserves for servicing defects were $11 million and $31 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. management is satisfied that adequate provision has been made in the company's consolidated financial statements for those representation and warranty obligations that are currently probable and reasonably estimable.
summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements. for a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. the most critical estimates include those used in determining:
(i)      liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;
(ii)     capitalization and amortization of dac and the establishment and amortization of voba;
(iii)    estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;
(iv)     investment impairments;
(v)      estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;
(vi)     measurement of goodwill and related impairment;
(vii)    measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;
(viii)   measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and
(ix)     liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.
96
in addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed - the most significant of which relate to aforementioned critical accounting estimates. in applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. actual results could differ from these estimates.
liability for future policy benefits generally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards. principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. if experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.
future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.
future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. liabilities for ulsg and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. the assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing dac, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. the assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the s&p 500 index.
we regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.
see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.
reinsurance accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. we periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. see "- investment impairments." additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. we review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. if we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.
see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.
97
deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as dac. in addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee's total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. we utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee's time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. these estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis or more frequently to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.
voba represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. for certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities, resulting in negative voba, which is presented separately from voba as an additional insurance liability included in other policy-related balances. the estimated fair value of the acquired obligations is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. the recovery of dac and voba is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of dac and voba. our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. we monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. the effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the dac and voba amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $230 million. we use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. the current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 7.0%.
we periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. these assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. we expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.
in 2016, as part of the annual actuarial assumption review, the company made changes to policyholder behavior and long-term economic assumptions, as well as risk margins, resulting in changes to the actual and expected future gross profits. other assumptions, such as expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts were also reviewed. see "- results of operations - consolidated results - year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015 - actuarial assumption review" for further information.
98
at december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, dac and voba for the company was $24.8 billion, $24.1 billion and $24.4 billion, respectively. in addition to assumption updates, amortization of dac and voba associated with the variable and universal life and annuity contracts was significantly impacted by movements in equity markets. the following illustrates the effect on dac and voba of changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. increases (decreases) in dac and voba balances, as presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization.

the following represent significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in 2016:
•   changes in net investment and net derivative gains (losses) resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization:
-   actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities, resulting in a decrease of dac and voba amortization of approximately $420 million, excluding the impact from our nonperformance risk and risk margins, which are described below. the increase in the guarantee liability valuations on variable annuities was mostly attributable to the annual actuarial assumption review, which is described more fully in "- results of operations - consolidated results - year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015 - actuarial assumption review." mark-to-market changes on the freestanding derivatives hedging such guarantee obligations resulted in a decrease in dac and voba amortization of approximately $920 million.
-   the company's nonperformance risk adjustment decreased the valuation of guaranteed liabilities, increased actual gross profits and increased dac and voba amortization by approximately $120 million. this is more than offset by higher risk margins, which increased the guarantee liability valuations, decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by approximately $380 million.
•   the change in current and projected gmib liabilities, mostly attributable to long-term investment rate of return and policyholder behavior related assumptions updates, as well as hedge gains, resulted in an increase to dac and voba amortization of approximately $90 million.

•   the change in policyholder dividends and other is primarily driven by:
-   an acceleration of approximately $360 million of dac amortization associated with universal life products resulting from the re-segmentation of metlife businesses to establish a brighthouse financial segment.
-   an increase of approximately $110 million of dac amortization resulting from the annual actuarial assumption update of the closed block.
-   an increase of approximately $70 million of dac amortization resulting from the dividend scale update.
the following represent significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in 2015:
•   changes in net investment and net derivative gains (losses) resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization:
-   actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities, resulting in a decrease of dac and voba amortization of $338 million, excluding the impact from our nonperformance risk and risk margins, which are described below. mark-to-market changes on the freestanding derivatives hedging such guarantee obligations resulted in an increase in dac and voba amortization of $114 million.
-   the company's nonperformance risk adjustment decreased the valuation of guaranteed liabilities, increased actual gross profits and increased dac and voba amortization by $17 million. this was partially offset by the lower risk margins, which increased the guarantee liability valuations, decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by $10 million.
-   the remainder of the impact increased dac and voba amortization by $226 million and was attributable to 2015 investment activities, methodology refinement, and assumption updates.
•   the change in gmibs resulted in an increase to dac amortization of $125 million mostly attributable to hedge gains.
•   better than expected persistency and updates in persistency assumptions caused an increase in actual and expected future gross profits resulting in a net decrease in dac and voba amortization of $220 million.
the following represent significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in 2014:
•   the increase in equity markets during the year increased separate account balances, which led to higher actual and expected future gross profits on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting in a decrease of $43 million in dac and voba amortization.
•changes in net investment gains (losses) resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization.
-   actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities, resulting in a decrease of dac and voba amortization of $118 million, excluding the impact from our nonperformance risk and risk margins, which are described below. this decrease in actual gross profits was more than offset by freestanding net derivative gains associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations, which resulted in an increase in dac and voba amortization of $219 million.
-   the widening of the company's nonperformance risk adjustment decreased the valuation of guaranteed liabilities, increased actual gross profits and increased dac and voba amortization by $44 million. this was more than offset by the higher risk margins, which increased the guarantee liability valuations, decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by $53 million.
-   the remainder of the impact of net investment gains (losses), which decreased dac and voba amortization by $50 million, was primarily attributable to 2014 investment activities.
•   the change in current and future projected gmibs liability resulted in an increase to dac amortization of $63 million.
•   better than expected persistency and changes in assumptions regarding persistency caused an increase in actual and expected future gross profits resulting in a net decrease in dac and voba amortization of $94 million.

our dac and voba balance is also impacted by unrealized investment gains (losses) and the amount of amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and losses had been realized. the increase in unrealized investment gains (losses) decreased the dac and voba balance by $158 million in 2016, while the change in unrealized investment gains increased the dac and voba balance by $638 million and decreased by $702 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. see notes 5 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the dac and voba offset to unrealized investment losses.
estimated fair value of investments in determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. when such quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. if these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.
the methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.
investment impairments one of the significant estimates related to afs securities is our impairment evaluation. the assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment ("otti") occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security-by-security basis. our review of each fixed maturity and equity security for otti includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and/or age of gross unrealized loss. an extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments. accordingly, such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected. in contrast, for certain equity securities, greater weight and consideration are given to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover.
additionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. factors we consider in the otti evaluation process are described in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.
see notes 1 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments.
derivatives the determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on significant inputs into the otc derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.
101
we issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). the estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. the projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. a risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. the valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. the nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for metlife, inc.'s debt, including related credit default swaps. these observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to metlife, inc. risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. the establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.
the table below illustrates the impact that a range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on our consolidated balance sheet, excluding the effect of income tax, related to the embedded derivative valuation on certain variable annuity products measured at estimated fair value. in determining the ranges, we have considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of spreads that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term. the ranges do not reflect extreme market conditions such as those experienced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as we do not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future.
in 2016, the company made changes to the actuarial assumptions that resulted in an increase in the fair value of the embedded derivatives. the impact of the range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads also increased significantly as compared to prior periods. however, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. therefore, the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below.

the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. if it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.
variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. if interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value on the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.
102
additionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. the value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.
see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test.
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. in such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition. the key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected operating earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit.
we apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. the valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management's reasonable expectation regarding future developments. these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.
in connection with the reorganization, the company realigned certain businesses among its existing and new segments. as a result, the company reallocated goodwill according to the relative fair values of the realigned businesses and reporting units. the company performed an analysis to identify all reporting units under this revised structure.
in the third quarter of 2016, the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test on the life and run-off reporting units in its brighthouse financial segment based upon its best available data at june 30, 2016. the company utilized an actuarial based cash flow testing valuation and embedded value approaches, respectively, which estimate the net worth of the reporting unit and the value of existing and new business, if applicable. under these actuarial-based methodologies, the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units was less than its carrying value, indicating a potential for goodwill impairment. the fair value of the life reporting unit was negatively impacted by a concentration in universal life products, including those with secondary guarantees, as it did not have the benefit of having a significant book of traditional life insurance. the run-off reporting unit, as a closed block, used a higher discount rate reflective of expected risk-adjusted returns associated with such business which negatively impacted its estimated fair value. as a result, the company performed the second step of its goodwill impairment process, which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value. this analysis indicated that the allocated goodwill associated with each of these reporting units was not recoverable. therefore, the company recorded a non-cash charge of $147 million ($126 million, net of income tax) and $113 million ($97 million, net of income tax) for the life and run-off reporting units, respectively, impairing the entire goodwill balance which is reported in goodwill impairment on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended december 31, 2016.
in addition, in the third quarter of 2016, the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test on the life reporting unit of its metlife holdings segment using the actuarial based embedded value fair valuation approach. the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 13% and, therefore, the reporting unit was not impaired. if we had assumed that the discount rate was 100 basis points higher than the discount rate used, the estimated fair value of the metlife holdings life reporting unit would have been less than the carrying value by approximately 7%. the metlife holdings life reporting unit consists of operations relating to products and businesses no longer actively marketed by the company. as of december 31, 2016, the life reporting unit of the metlife holdings segment had a $887 million goodwill balance.
103
the company also performed its annual goodwill impairment tests of all other reporting units during the third quarter of 2016 using a qualitative assessment and/or quantitative assessments under the market multiple, discounted cash flow and/or actuarial-based valuation approaches based on best available data as of june 30, 2016 and concluded that the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.
see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our goodwill.
employee benefit plans certain subsidiaries of metlife, inc. sponsor and/or administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees and sales representatives. the calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirement, withdrawal rates and mortality. in consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.
we determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. given the amount of plan assets as of december 31, 2015, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $100 million and an increase of $100 million, respectively, in 2016. this considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.
we determine the discount rates used to value the company's pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. given our pension and postretirement obligations as of december 31, 2015, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $110 million and an increase of $123 million, respectively, in 2016. this considers only changes in our assumed discount rates without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate. the assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. these differences may have a significant effect on the company's consolidated financial statements and liquidity.
see note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.
income taxes we provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. in establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign.
in establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.
valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.
104
we may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported on the financial statements in the year these changes occur.
see notes 1 and 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our income taxes.
litigation contingencies we are a party to a number of legal actions and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. given the inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to estimate the impact on our financial position. liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate our asbestos-related liability include the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against us when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. on a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
see note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.
economic capital economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in our business.
our economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. the model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the company is exposed. these consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. metlife's management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.
segment net investment income, with the exception of the brighthouse financial segment, is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact our consolidated net investment income, income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax or operating earnings. the brighthouse financial segment's net investment income represents that of the legal entities which comprise brighthouse and its subsidiaries on a historical basis, however, may not be indicative of that on a combined standalone basis.
net investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment's specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the company's product pricing.

year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015
during the year ended december 31, 2016, income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax decreased $7.7 billion ($4.5 billion, net of income tax) from 2015 primarily driven by an unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) of $6.8 billion ($4.4 billion, net of income tax). unfavorable changes in operating earnings and net investment gains (losses), as well as a 2016 goodwill impairment charge, also contributed to the decrease. in addition, in 2016, income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax includes the financial impact of converting the company's japan operations to calendar year-end reporting without retrospective application of this change to prior years.
management of investment portfolio and hedging market risks with derivatives. we manage our investment portfolio using disciplined alm principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. these securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. in addition, our general account investment portfolio includes, within fvo and trading securities, contractholder-directed unit-linked investments supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities, which do not qualify as separate account assets. the returns on these contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, which can vary significantly from period to period, include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase, inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances.
we purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. however, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold.
we also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. we continually reexamine our strategy for managing such risks.
we use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. a small portion of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. for those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings.
certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). we use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. the valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.

net derivative gains (losses). the variable annuity embedded derivatives and associated freestanding derivative hedges are collectively referred to as "va program derivatives" in the following table. all other derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as "non-va program derivatives" in the following table. the table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-va program derivatives and va program derivatives:

the unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-va program derivatives was $1.8 billion ($1.2 billion, net of income tax). this was primarily due to long-term interest rates increasing during 2016 and decreasing during 2015, unfavorably impacting receive-fixed interest rate swaps and total rate of return swaps primarily hedging long-duration liability portfolios. because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.
the unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on va program derivatives was $5.0 billion ($3.2 billion, net of income tax). this was due to an unfavorable change of $3.8 billion ($2.5 billion, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change of $1.6 billion ($1.0 billion, net of income tax) in market risks in embedded derivatives, net of the impact of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $357 million ($232 million, net of income tax) related to the change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives. other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged.
the foregoing $3.8 billion ($2.5 billion, net of income tax) unfavorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflected:
•   updates to actuarial policyholder behavior assumptions within the valuation model. for details, see "- actuarial assumption review"; and
•   an increase in the risk margin adjustment, measuring policyholder behavior risks, which was also affected by the 2016 actuarial assumption update, along with market and interest rate changes; partially offset by
•   the cross effect of capital market changes and the mismatch of fund performance between actual and modeled funds; and
•   a combination of other factors, including reserve changes influenced by benefit features and actual policyholder behavior, as well as fcta.
the foregoing $1.6 billion ($1.0 billion, net of income tax) unfavorable change reflects a $3.2 billion ($2.1 billion, net of income tax) unfavorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives, partially offset by a $1.6 billion ($1.1 billion, net of income tax) favorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives.
109
the primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:
•   long-term interest rates increased in 2016 and decreased in 2015, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. for example, the 10-year u.s. swap rate increased 15 basis points in 2016 and decreased 10 basis points in 2015.
•   key equity index levels mostly increased in 2016 and decreased in 2015, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. for example, the s&amp;p 500 index increased 10% in 2016 and decreased 1% in 2015.
the aforementioned $357 million ($232 million, net of income tax) favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives resulted from a favorable change of $547 million, before income tax, as a result of model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by an unfavorable change of $190 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread.
when equity index levels decrease in isolation, the variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.
when the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.
when our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. as a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. for each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction.
net investment gains (losses). the unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $426 million ($277 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects higher gains on sales of real estate, fixed maturity securities and equity securities in 2015 than in 2016 and an increase in the provision for mortgage loan losses in 2016. these unfavorable changes were partially offset by lower foreign currency transaction losses, as well as a gain from the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture in 2016.
goodwill. the year ended december 31, 2016 includes $260 million ($223 million, net of income tax) of non-cash charges for goodwill impairment associated with our brighthouse financial segment. see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
actuarial assumption review. results for 2016 include a $3.2 billion ($2.1 billion, net of income tax) non-cash charge associated with the annual review of assumptions related to reserves and dac, of which a $3.7 billion loss ($2.4 billion, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses) and a loss of $103 million ($67 million, net of income tax) was recognized in updates to the closed block projection. of the $3.2 billion charge, $3.9 billion ($2.5 billion, net of income tax) was related to reserves and a benefit of $732 million ($478 million, net of income tax) was associated with dac.
the $3.7 billion loss recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with this review of assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above.
the significant impacts of the annual actuarial assumption review were on the u.s. variable annuity block of business and are summarized as follows:
•   changes in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in reserve increases, partially offset by favorable dac amortization, resulting in a net charge of $2.3 billion ($1.5 billion, net of income tax). the policyholder behavior assumption changes included:
- lower utilization of the elective annuitization option on the guarantee riders on the contracts;
- lower election of the guaranteed principal option in certain of our gmibs, which, if exercised, returns to the policyholder the original purchase payment amounts;
- adjusting the rate at which policyholders withdrew funds through systematic withdrawals; and
- higher policyholder persistency related to the portion of the business that will remain with the company after the proposed separation, dependent on the amount a contract is in-the-money.
110
•   changes in economic assumptions resulted in reserve increases and unfavorable dac amortization resulting in a charge of $487 million ($316 million, net of income tax). these changes include reducing the long-term separate account return assumption from 7.25% to 7.00% (from 7.00% to 6.75% for gmib's invested in managed volatility funds), and reducing the projected ultimate 10-year treasury rate from 4.50% to 4.25%.
•   the remaining updates resulted in reserve increases from changes in risk margins, partially offset by favorable dac, resulting in a charge of $428 million ($277 million, net of income tax).
results for 2015 include a $313 million ($203 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and dac, of which a $3 million loss ($2 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). of the $313 million charge, $60 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to dac and $253 million ($164 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves.
divested businesses and lag elimination. income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax related to the divested businesses and lag elimination, excluding net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), decreased $228 million ($159 million, net of income tax) to a loss of $225 million ($154 million, net of income tax) in 2016 from income of $3 million ($5 million, net of income tax) in 2015. included in this decline was an increase in total revenues of $659 million, before income tax, and an increase in total expenses of $887 million, before income tax. results for 2016 include the financial impact of converting the company's japan operations to calendar year-end reporting without retrospective application of this change to prior years, as well as expenses and charges associated with the u.s retail advisor force divestiture and the proposed separation.
taxes. income tax benefit for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $999 million, or 512% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, compared with income tax expense of $2.1 billion, or 29% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, for the year ended december 31, 2015. the company's effective tax rates differ from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% typically due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the u.s. statutory rate. our 2016 results include the following tax items: (i) a $110 million benefit related to a change in tax rate in japan, (ii) a $66 million benefit due to a deferred tax adjustment related to goodwill, (iii) a $46 million benefit for tax audit settlements, and (iv) a $22 million benefit related to an investment tax credit, partially offset by (v) a $22 million charge related to the filing of the company's u.s. federal tax return, and (vi) a $19 million charge related to a change in tax rate in chile. our 2016 results also include the aforementioned $260 million ($223 million, net of income tax) non-cash charges for goodwill impairment. the tax benefit on these charges was limited to $37 million on the associated tax goodwill. our 2015 results include tax charges of $681 million, of which $557 million was recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties, $88 million was related to foreign exchange-related gains on investments in argentina and $36 million was the result of a deferred tax liability true-up in japan. these charges were partially offset by the following tax benefits: (i) $174 million related to a change in tax rate in japan, (ii) $61 million related to the restructuring of our business in chile, (iii) $57 million related to the repatriation of earnings from japan, and (iv) $31 million related to the devaluation of the peso in argentina.
operating earnings. as more fully described in "- non-gaap and other financial disclosures," we use operating earnings, which does not equate to income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, as determined in accordance with gaap, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance, and allocate resources. we believe that the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results. operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders should not be viewed as substitutes for income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, and net income (loss) available to metlife, inc.'s common shareholders, respectively. operating earnings available to common shareholders decreased $395 million, net of income tax, to $5.1 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended december 31, 2016 from $5.5 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended december 31, 2015.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014
during the year ended december 31, 2015, income (loss) from continuing operations, before provision for income tax, decreased $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion, net of income tax) from 2014 primarily due to an unfavorable change in operating earnings, driven by the aforementioned tax charge and related charge for interest on uncertain tax positions, and an unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses), partially offset by a favorable change in net investment gains (losses).

the unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-va program derivatives was $386 million ($251 million, net of income tax). this was primarily due to long-term interest rates decreasing less in 2015 than in 2014, unfavorably impacting receive-fixed interest rate swaptions and interest rate swaps primarily hedging long-duration liability portfolios.
these unfavorable changes were partially offset by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other key currencies favorably impacting foreign currency forwards and futures that primarily hedge foreign denominated fixed maturity securities. in addition, a change in the value of the underlying assets favorably impacted non-va embedded derivatives related to funds withheld on a certain reinsurance agreement. because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.
the unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on va program derivatives was $893 million ($580 million, net of income tax). this was due to an unfavorable change of $685 million ($445 million, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change of $358 million ($233 million, net of income tax) in market risks in embedded derivatives, net of the impact of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, partially offset by a favorable change of $150 million ($98 million, net of income tax) related to the change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives. other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged.
the foregoing $685 million ($445 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflected:
•   refinements in the valuation model, which resulted in an unfavorable year over year change in the valuation of the embedded derivatives.
•   the cross effect of capital markets changes, which resulted in an unfavorable year over year change in the valuation of the embedded derivatives.
•   a combination of other factors, including reserve changes influenced by benefit features and policyholder behavior, as well as fcta, which resulted in an unfavorable year over year change in the valuation of embedded derivatives.

the foregoing $358 million ($233 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change was comprised of an $838 million ($545 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives, which was partially offset by a $480 million ($312 million, net of income tax) favorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives.
the primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:
•   long-term interest rates decreased less in 2015 than in 2014, contributing to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. for example, the 30-year u.s. swap rate decreased 3% in 2015 and 31% in 2014.
•   key equity index levels decreased in 2015 and increased in 2014, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. for example, the s&amp;p 500 index decreased 1% in 2015 and increased 11% in 2014.
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives related to the assumed reinsurance of certain variable annuity products from the company's former operating joint venture in japan. for example, the japanese yen strengthened against the euro 10% in 2015 as compared with a weakening of less than 1% against the euro in 2014.
the aforementioned $150 million ($98 million, net of income tax) favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives was due to a favorable change of $148 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread and a favorable change of $2 million, before income tax, as a result of changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on the variable annuity guarantees.
net investment gains (losses). the favorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $794 million ($516 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects a loss in 2014 on the disposition of mal and higher net gains on sales of real estate in 2015, partially offset by lower net gains on sales and disposals of fixed maturity securities in 2015. for further information on mal, see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
actuarial assumption review. results for 2015 include a $313 million ($203 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and dac, of which a $3 million loss ($2 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). of the $313 million charge, $60 million ($39 million, net of income tax) was related to dac and $253 million ($164 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves.
the $3 million loss recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual assumption review was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above.
as a result of our annual assumption review, changes were made to economic, policyholder behavior, mortality and other assumptions. the most significant impacts were in the metlife holdings segment and are summarized as follows:
•   changes in economic assumptions resulted in an increase of dac and reserves, resulting in a net charge of $122 million ($79 million, net of income tax).
•   changes in policyholder behavior and mortality assumptions resulted in reserve increases, offset by favorable dac, resulting in a net charge of $91 million ($59 million, net of income tax).
•   the remaining updates resulted in an increase in reserves, coupled with unfavorable dac, resulting in a charge of $100 million ($65 million, net of income tax). the most notable update was related to our projection of closed block results.
results for 2014 include a $161 million ($105 million, net of income tax) benefit associated with our annual assumption review related to reserves and dac, of which $137 million ($89 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). of the $161 million benefit, $82 million ($53 million, net of income tax) was related to dac and $79 million ($52 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves.

taxes. income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $2.1 billion, or 29% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, compared with $2.5 billion, or 28% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, for the year ended december 31, 2014. the company's 2015 effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the u.s. statutory rate. our 2015 results include tax charges of $681 million, of which $557 million was recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties, $88 million was related to foreign exchange-related gains on investments in argentina and $36 million was the result of a deferred tax liability true-up in japan. these charges were partially offset by tax benefits of $174 million in japan related to a change in tax rate, $61 million related to restructuring in chile, $57 million related to the repatriation of earnings from japan and $31 million related to the devaluation of the peso in argentina. the company's 2014 effective tax rate was different from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the u.s. statutory rate, and the tax effects of the mal divestiture. the 2014 period also includes a $54 million tax charge related to tax reform in chile, a $45 million tax charge related to the repatriation of earnings from japan and an $18 million tax charge related to a portion of the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter which was not deductible for income tax purposes, partially offset by a $32 million tax benefit related to the filing of the company's u.s. federal tax return.
operating earnings. operating earnings available to common shareholders decreased $1.1 billion, net of income tax, to $5.5 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended december 31, 2015 from $6.6 billion, net of income tax, for the year ended december 31, 2014.

consolidated results - operating year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015
unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.
overview. the primary drivers of the decrease in operating earnings were lower investment yields, refinements made to dac and certain insurance-related liabilities, unfavorable underwriting, the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review and lower asset-based fee income, partially offset by 2015 charges for taxes and related interest expenses, as well as higher net investment income from portfolio growth.
foreign currency. changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $51 million negative impact on operating earnings compared to 2015. unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.
business growth. a $524 million increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth. we benefited from positive net flows from many of our products. as a result, growth in the investment portfolios of our brighthouse financial, u.s., asia and latin america segments generated higher net investment income. however, this was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense on certain insurance-related liabilities. in addition, improved results from our start-up operations also increased operating earnings.
market factors. market factors, including low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on reported net investment income in our non-u.s. segments and inflation-indexed investments, investment yields decreased. investment yields were negatively affected by the adverse impact of the low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio were invested at lower yields than the portfolio average. in addition, we experienced a decrease in returns on real estate joint ventures and alternative investments. lower investment earnings on our securities lending program resulted primarily from lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve. these decreases in net investment income were partially offset by higher income on derivatives. in our brighthouse financial and metlife holdings segments, declines in our average separate account balances resulted in a decrease in asset-based fee income. the changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $684 million decrease in operating earnings.
underwriting, actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments. unfavorable underwriting resulted in a $262 million decrease in operating earnings as a result of higher non-catastrophe claim costs, less favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses and a charge related to an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in our asia segment. in addition, unfavorable mortality and morbidity experience in our brighthouse financial and metlife holdings segments was partially offset by favorable experience in our latin america and u.s. segments. the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both 2016 and 2015, resulted in a $154 million decrease in operating earnings. refinements to dac and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in both 2016 and 2015, resulted in a $643 million decrease in operating earnings, primarily as a result of the aforementioned 2016 charges in our brighthouse financial segment totaling $340 million due to loss recognition testing upon re-segmentation and a 2016 reserve adjustment of $257 million resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process in our universal life businesses.
expenses and taxes. our results for 2015 include the aforementioned $235 million charge for interest on uncertain tax positions. in addition, other expenses declined by $104 million primarily due to expense savings of approximately $100 million related to the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture. excluding these items, expenses were essentially unchanged in total, but included offsetting fluctuations across our businesses. the company's effective tax rates differ from the u.s. statutory rate of 35% typically due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the u.s. statutory rate. higher utilization of tax preferenced items and foreign rate differential improved 2016 operating earnings by $41 million over 2015. our results for 2016 include the following tax items: (i) a $46 million benefit for tax audit settlements, (ii) a $25 million benefit related to a change in the tax rate in japan, and (iii) a $22 million benefit related to an investment tax credit, partially offset by (iv) a $22 million charge related to the filing of the u.s. federal tax return and (v) a $12 million charge related to a change in the tax rate in chile. the $25 million benefit in japan includes a benefit of $20 million that pertains to prior years; the $12 million tax charge in chile includes a charge of $10 million that pertains to prior years. our results for 2015 include the following tax items: (i) a charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties, (ii) a benefit of $61 million related to a change in the tax rate in japan, (iii) a benefit of $60 million related to the restructuring of our business in chile, (iv) a benefit of $31 million related to the repatriation of earnings from japan, and (v) a $31 million benefit related to devaluation of the peso in argentina.

year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014
unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.
overview. the primary drivers of the decrease in operating earnings were lower investment yields, a tax charge and a related charge for interest on uncertain tax positions in 2015, less favorable underwriting results and an unfavorable impact from our annual review of actuarial assumptions, partially offset by higher net investment income from portfolio growth.
foreign currency. changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $303 million negative impact on operating earnings compared to 2014.
business growth. we benefited from higher sales and business growth across many of our products. growth in the investment portfolios of our domestic and latin america segments generated higher net investment income, which was partially offset by higher surrenders of foreign currency-denominated fixed annuity products in japan. the changes in business growth discussed above resulted in a $483 million increase in operating earnings.
market factors. market factors, including the sustained low interest rate environment, continued to impact our investment yields. excluding the impact of inflation-indexed investments in the latin america segment, investment yields decreased. investment yields were negatively impacted by the adverse impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as well as by lower returns on other limited partnership interests and our securities lending program. these decreases were partially offset by higher income on currency and interest rate derivatives and higher returns on real estate and real estate joint ventures. the changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $558 million decrease in operating earnings.
underwriting, actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments. a $76 million decrease in underwriting results was primarily due to higher non-catastrophe related claim costs, as well as higher catastrophe-related losses in our property & casualty businesses, partially offset by favorable mortality. favorable mortality in our u.s. and brighthouse financial segments was partially offset by less favorable mortality in our metlife holdings segment. on an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and dac. these annual updates, which occurred in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $98 million and were primarily related to unfavorable dac unlockings in our metlife holdings and brighthouse financial segments. refinements to dac and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both 2015 and 2014 resulted in a net decrease of $24 million in operating earnings. the 2014 refinements include favorable reserve adjustments related to disability premium waivers and a charge related to delayed settlement interest on unclaimed funds held by state governments, in our metlife holdings and brighthouse financial segments.
expenses. in 2015, other expenses include the aforementioned $235 million charge for interest on uncertain tax positions. an additional $77 million increase in expenses was primarily the result of higher employee-related costs and an increase in expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects, primarily in asia. these increases were partially offset by a $117 million accrual in 2014 to increase the litigation reserve related to asbestos, as well as 2014 charges totaling $57 million related to the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter.
taxes. the company's 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates differed from the u.s. statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the u.s. statutory rate. our results for 2015 include the aforementioned tax charge of $557 million recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties, partially offset by a $61 million benefit in japan related to a tax rate change, a tax benefit of $60 million related to restructuring in chile, a $31 million tax benefit related to the repatriation of earnings from japan and a $31 million tax benefit related to the devaluation of the peso in argentina. in 2014, the company realized a $32 million tax benefit related to the filing of the company's u.s. federal tax return. however, this was more than offset by a $41 million tax charge related to tax reform in chile and an $18 million tax charge related to the aforementioned settlement of a licensing matter which was not deductible for income tax purposes.
118
segment results and corporate & other u.s.
business overview. an increase in sales was primarily driven by sales of stable value products, as well as funding agreement issuances in our retirement and income solutions business. in addition, sales of pension risk transfers and structured settlements were slightly higher than in 2015. these increases were partially offset by slightly lower sales in the income annuities and pensions businesses. changes in premiums for the retirement and income solutions business were almost entirely offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits and claims. sales increased 24% compared to 2015 in the group benefits business, with strong sales across our core and voluntary products. in our property & casualty business, sales of new policies were slightly lower for both the auto and homeowners lines of business. the number of policies that were not renewed exceeded new policy sales, resulting in a decrease in exposures.

year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015
unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.
business growth. the impact of deposits, funding agreement issuances and increased premiums in 2016 resulted in higher average invested assets, improving net investment income. however, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, interest credited on long-duration contracts increased. an increase in average premium per policy in both our auto and homeowners businesses improved operating earnings. in addition, an increase in other operating expenses, mainly the result of growth across the segment, was more than offset by the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. the combined impact of the items discussed above increased operating earnings by $175 million.
119
market factors. market factors, including low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. investment yields decreased as a result of the impact of the low interest rate environment on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio were invested at lower yields than the portfolio average. in addition, lower returns on alternative investments, other limited partnership interests and lower prepayment fees reduced yields. lower investment earnings on our securities lending program resulted primarily from lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve. these unfavorable changes were partially offset by higher income on derivatives and real estate. certain of our funding agreements and guaranteed interest contract liabilities have interest credited rates that are contractually tied to current market rates, specifically the 3-month libor and, as a result, a higher average interest credited rate drove an increase in interest credited expense. however, consistent with the decrease in yields on average invested assets, interest credited on certain long-duration insurance contracts decreased. the changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $147 million decrease in operating earnings.
underwriting and other insurance adjustments. favorable claims experience in our individual disability and voluntary businesses were partially offset by unfavorable claims experience in our group disability and dental businesses and resulted in a $12 million increase in operating earnings. favorable mortality in 2016, mainly due to favorable claims experience in our life business, resulted in a $26 million increase in operating earnings. less favorable mortality from our pension risk transfer business and specialized life insurance products resulted in a $10 million decrease in operating earnings. in our property & casualty business, non-catastrophe claim costs increased by $85 million, resulting from higher frequencies and severities in both our auto and homeowners businesses, as well as an increase in claims adjustment expenses. in addition, less favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses reduced operating earnings by $43 million. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in catastrophe losses, which improved operating earnings by $3 million. refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both 2016 and 2015, resulted in a $25 million decrease in operating earnings.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014
unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.
business growth. an increase in average premium per policy in both our auto and homeowners businesses improved operating earnings. growth in premiums, deposits and funding agreement issuances in 2015, as well as an increase in allocated equity resulted in higher average invested assets, improving net investment income. however, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, deposits and funding agreement issuances, interest credited on long-duration contracts increased. an increase in the annual assessment of the ppaca fee increased other expenses in 2015; however, the impact of the assessment was significantly offset by a related increase in premiums from our dental business. in addition, an increase in other operating expenses, mainly the result of growth across the segment, was more than offset by the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. the combined impact of the items discussed above increased operating earnings by $120 million.
market factors. market factors, including sustained low interest rates and volatile equity markets, continued to impact our investment yields. the sustained low interest rate environment drove lower investment yields on our fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. yields were also negatively impacted by a reduction in the size of our securities lending program. in addition, weaker equity markets in 2015 resulted in lower returns on other limited partnership interests, which were partially offset by higher returns on alternative investments and interest rate derivatives. many of our funding agreements and guaranteed interest contract liabilities have interest credited rates that are contractually tied to external indices and, as a result, we set lower interest credited rates on new business, as well as on existing business with terms that can fluctuate. the combined impact of lower investment returns partially offset by lower interest credited expense, resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $95 million.
120
underwriting and other insurance adjustments. in our property & casualty business, non-catastrophe claim costs increased $63 million, the result of higher severities in both our auto and homeowners businesses, as well as an increase in frequencies in our auto business, partially offset by lower frequencies in our homeowners businesses. in addition, catastrophe-related losses increased by $48 million, mainly due to severe winter weather in 2015. further, less favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses resulted in a slight decrease to operating earnings. less favorable reserve development in our dental business was partially offset by favorable morbidity experience in our individual and group disability businesses, resulting in a $31 million decrease in operating earnings. less favorable mortality in our structured settlement and income annuity businesses was partially offset by more favorable mortality from our pension risk transfer and specialized life insurance products, and resulted in a $10 million decrease in operating earnings. our life and ad&d businesses experienced favorable mortality in 2015, mainly due to favorable claims experience, which resulted in a $48 million increase in operating earnings. refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in an $8 million decrease in operating earnings.
asia business overview. sales decreased compared to 2015 primarily due to management actions taken to improve product value in the region. in japan, we have seen a successful shift in sales to foreign currency denominated life products from yen denominated life products, although sales of accident and health products packaged with yen denominated life products declined. sales increased in emerging markets, including china and bangladesh, mainly due to business growth.

following a change in the foreign investment law in india, the company no longer consolidates its india operating joint venture, effective january 1, 2016. while this change in accounting does affect the comparability of the financial statement line items, it did not have a significant impact on operating earnings and, therefore, is not discussed below.
foreign currency. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased operating earnings by $46 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the strengthening of the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar. unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.
121
business growth. positive net flows in japan and korea resulted in higher average invested assets and an increase in net investment income. asia's premiums and fees decreased from 2015 mainly driven by lower fixed annuity surrenders and the shift from premium-based to fee-based products in 2016. the discontinuation of single premium products in our accident & health business in japan in the third quarter of 2015 also contributed to the decline in premiums. changes in premiums for these businesses were partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. the combined impact of the items discussed above improved operating earnings by $64 million.
market factors. market factors, including low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. investment returns were unfavorably impacted by lower interest rates on fixed maturity securities, and the impact of incremental income recognized in 2015 from the recovery of a previously impaired mortgage loan, both in japan. the decreases in investment returns were partially offset by the favorable impact of increased sales of foreign currency-denominated fixed annuities in japan, primarily in its australian currency-denominated portfolio, which drove an increase in higher yielding foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities, as well as higher returns on other limited partnership interests. lower investment yields, partially offset by the impact of credit and foreign currency hedges, decreased operating earnings by $113 million.
underwriting, actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments. our results for 2016 include a $44 million charge related to an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in australia. excluding this charge, lower fixed annuity surrender gains and higher lapses in japan, partially offset by favorable claims experience in australia and korea, decreased operating earnings by $15 million. the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both 2016 and 2015, resulted in a net decrease of $35 million in operating earnings. refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in 2016, resulted in a $36 million increase in operating earnings.
expenses and taxes. an increase in expenses, primarily driven by costs associated with growth of our agency channel in hong kong, information technology, and marketing, partially offset by lower consumption tax in japan and a decline in corporate overhead, reduced operating earnings by $13 million. results for 2016 include a $25 million tax benefit related to a change in the corporate tax rate in japan (which includes a benefit of $20 million that pertains to prior periods). results for 2015 include tax benefits of $61 million related to a change in tax rates, $12 million for the settlement of an audit and $15 million related to the u.s. taxation of dividends, each related to japan, as well as a $6 million tax refund in korea in 2015 related to unclaimed surrender value.

foreign currency. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced operating earnings by $126 million for 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the weakening of the yen against the u.s. dollar.
this resulted in significant variances on the financial statement line items.
business growth. asia's premiums, fees and other revenues increased over the prior year driven by broad based in-force growth across the region, including growth in our ordinary life and accident & health businesses in japan and korea, as well as our group insurance business in australia. changes in premiums for these businesses were partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. during the period, surrenders of foreign currency-denominated fixed annuity products in japan also contributed to higher fee income. the impact of these surrenders, partially offset by positive net flows in korea, bangladesh and india, resulted in lower average invested assets and a decrease in net investment income. in addition, a decrease in interest credited expenses was partially offset by increases in amortization of dac and voba, commissions and variable expenses (net of dac capitalization), primarily related to the establishment of an agency channel in hong kong. the combined impact of the items discussed above improved operating earnings by $61 million.
market factors. investment returns were positively impacted by higher net investment income resulting from the recovery of a previously impaired mortgage loan in japan, improved operating results from our china joint venture and higher interest rates on fixed maturity securities in bangladesh. these improved investment returns were partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on fixed maturity securities in korea and the impact in japan of continued growth of lower yielding japanese government securities. the decrease in returns from japanese government securities was offset by the favorable impact of increased foreign currency-denominated fixed annuities in japan driving an increase in higher yielding foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity securities. higher investment yields, combined with the impact of foreign currency hedges, increased operating earnings by $38 million.
122
underwriting and actuarial assumption review. favorable claims experience, primarily in japan resulted in a $15 million increase in operating earnings. in addition, on an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and dac. this annual update resulted in a net operating earnings increase of $22 million.
expenses and taxes. higher expenses, primarily driven by costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, reduced operating earnings by $32 million. our 2015 results include tax benefits of $61 million related to a change in tax rates, $12 million for the settlement of an audit and $15 million related to the u.s. taxation of dividends, each related to japan. in addition, in 2015, korea received a tax refund of $6 million related to unclaimed surrender value. our 2014 results include tax benefits of $9 million related to the u.s. taxation of dividends and $4 million resulting from a tax rate change, each related to japan.
latin america business overview. total sales for latin america increased over 2015. the region experienced higher medical, accident & health and property & casualty sales, partially offset by lower sales of pension and life products.

foreign currency. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating earnings by $81 million for 2016 as compared to 2015 mainly due to the weakening of the mexican and argentinean pesos against the u.s. dollar. unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.
business growth. latin america experienced business growth across several lines of business within mexico, chile and argentina. this business growth resulted in increased premiums and policy fee income which was partially offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits. positive net flows, primarily from chile, mexico and argentina, resulted in an increase in average invested assets and generated higher net investment income. this was partially offset by an increase in interest credited expense on certain insurance liabilities. business growth also drove an increase in operating expenses, commissions and dac amortization, which were partially offset by higher dac capitalization. the items discussed above resulted in a $59 million increase in operating earnings.
123
market factors. changes in market factors resulted in a $17 million increase to operating earnings as higher investment yields were partially offset by higher interest credited expense. an increase in investment yields was primarily driven by a 2016 change in the crediting rate on allocated equity in mexico, chile and argentina, as well as higher yields from fixed maturity securities in mexico. these increases were partially offset by lower returns on fixed maturity securities, alternative investments and mortgage loans in chile.
underwriting, actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments. favorable underwriting resulted in a $38 million increase in operating earnings driven by lower claims experience in mexico and chile. the impact of the annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both 2016 and 2015, resulted in a net operating earnings increase of $16 million. refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other adjustments in both 2016 and 2015 resulted in a $26 million decrease to operating earnings.
taxes. effective september 1, 2015, afp provida was merged into metlife chile acquisition company resulting in an income tax benefit of $60 million in 2015. in the first quarter of 2016, our chilean businesses, including provida, incurred a tax charge of $12 million as a result of tax reform legislation in chile (including a charge of $10 million that pertains to prior periods). in addition, other tax-related adjustments in both 2016 and 2015 resulted in a net decrease in operating earnings of $20 million. these adjustments were mainly driven by tax charges related to the filing of local tax returns in mexico and chile in 2016 and a tax benefit in 2015 due to the devaluation of the peso in argentina, partially offset by a 2016 tax benefit due to inflation in argentina.

foreign currency. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating earnings by $111 million for 2015 compared to 2014 mainly due to the weakening of the peso against the u.s. dollar, which included the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the tax charge resulting from tax reform in chile, as discussed further below.
business growth. total sales for the region decreased primarily due to the impact of a large contract in mexico in 2014. excluding this large contract, sales increased due to organic growth in several countries but the resulting increase in premiums was partially offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. an increase in average invested assets, primarily in chile and mexico, generated higher net investment income. growth in our businesses resulted in higher policy fee income, as well as increased marketing costs and commissions, which were partially offset by increased dac capitalization. the items discussed above were the primary drivers of a $135 million increase in operating earnings.
market factors. the net impact of changes in market factors resulted in an $83 million decrease in operating earnings, driven by lower investment yields and higher interest credited expense. investment yields decreased on fixed income securities in chile and mexico and we experienced lower investment returns on alternative investments in chile.
underwriting and other insurance adjustments. unfavorable claims experience in several countries decreased operating earnings by $9 million. refinements to dac and other adjustments recorded in both 2015 and 2014 resulted in a $10 million increase in operating earnings.
expenses and taxes. effective september 1, 2015, provida was merged into metlife chile acquisition company resulting in an income tax benefit of $60 million in 2015. in the third quarter of 2014, our chilean businesses, including provida, incurred a tax charge of $41 million ($33 million after adjusting for foreign currency fluctuations) as a result of tax reform in chile. other tax-related adjustments in both 2015 and 2014 decreased operating earnings by $18 million. these tax-related adjustments include tax charges related to inflation in chile and mexico, as well as a 2014 refund claim in argentina, partially offset by a benefit resulting from the devaluation of the peso in argentina in both 2015 and 2014. in addition, employee-related costs, which include inflation, were higher across several countries, resulting in an $18 million decrease in operating earnings.

foreign currency. the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced operating earnings by $16 million for 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily driven by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the british pound, turkish lira, egyptian pound and polish zloty. unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.
business growth. operating earnings increased by $35 million as a result of business growth mainly in the employee benefits business in the middle east and the u.k.
underwriting, actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments. favorable underwriting, primarily in our accident & health business in greece, was largely offset by unfavorable underwriting, primarily in our employee benefits business and resulted in an operating earnings increase of $2 million. the impact of the annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both 2016 and 2015, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $22 million. refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other adjustments in 2016 resulted in a $4 million increase to operating earnings.
expenses. operating earnings increased by $43 million primarily due to expense discipline across the region and lower allocated corporate overhead expenses.
taxes and other. the company received tax benefits in both 2016 and 2015; however, since the 2015 benefit exceeded the 2016 benefit, operating earnings decreased by $19 million. operating earnings for 2015 were positively impacted by the conversion to calendar year reporting for certain of our subsidiaries; however, this was offset by certain one-time items, including re-branding and legal expenses. our 2016 operating earnings benefited from the cancellation of a distribution agreement with one of our bancassurance partners, which improved operating earnings by $3 million.

business growth. operating earnings benefited from growth in the middle east, primarily in the gulf and turkey, as well as growth in the u.k., increasing operating earnings by $30 million.
actuarial assumption review. on an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and dac. these annual updates, which occurred in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $4 million. in addition, operating earnings increased by $5 million due to a 2014 refinement of dac in the u.k.
taxes and other. the company had a number of one-time items in both 2015 and 2014, including tax benefits, the conversion of certain of our subsidiaries to calendar year reporting, as well as re-branding and legal expenses. the combined impact of these items decreased operating earnings by $3 million. in addition, our 2014 results included a $7 million benefit related to pension reform in poland.
metlife holdings business overview. as a result of the proposed separation and the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture, we have discontinued the marketing of life and annuity products in this segment, which has led to lower sales. this will result in a declining dac asset over time and we anticipate an average decline in premiums, fees and other revenues of approximately 5% per year from expected business run-off. a significant portion of our operating earnings is driven by separate account balances. most directly, these balances determine asset-based fee income but they also impact dac amortization and asset-based commissions. separate account balances are driven by sales, movements in the market, surrenders, withdrawals, benefit payments, transfers and policy charges. separate account balances increased due to equity market performance, partially offset by the impact of negative net flows, as benefits, surrenders and withdrawals exceeded sales. while net flows are still negative, we are seeing stability in surrenders and withdrawals. although we have discontinued selling our long-term care product, we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business, which contributed to asset growth in the segment, and we expect the related reserves to grow as this block matures.

business growth. net investment income increased slightly resulting from a larger invested asset base. net asset growth in our life, annuities and long-term care businesses was largely offset by negative net flows as a result of the recapture of two assumed single-premium deferred annuity reinsurance agreements (by affiliates included in the brighthouse financial segment), which decreased our invested asset base. consistent with the aforementioned asset growth, interest credited on insurance liabilities also increased. lower universal life sales resulted in lower fee income. additionally, operating earnings increased since the operating loss from broker-dealer operations was included in the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture; this also resulted in declines in both revenues and expenses. the combined impact of the items discussed above resulted in a $6 million decrease in operating earnings.
market factors. market factors, including low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. investment yields decreased on our fixed maturity securities as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio were invested at lower yields than the portfolio average. we also had lower income on derivatives and alternative investments. these decreases in net investment income were partially offset by higher returns on private equities. in our deferred annuity business, lower equity returns in 2015 drove a decline in average separate account balances which resulted in a decrease in asset-based fee income in 2016 relative to 2015. this decrease was partially offset by lower average interest crediting rates and declines in dac amortization. the changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $189 million decrease in operating earnings.
underwriting, actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments. unfavorable mortality, primarily in our universal life business, and unfavorable claim experience in our long-term care business resulted in a $58 million decrease in operating earnings. the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both 2016 and 2015, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $34 million and was primarily related to unfavorable dac unlockings. refinements to dac and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both 2016 and 2015, including a 2016 reserve adjustment resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process in our universal life business, resulted in a $165 million decrease in operating earnings.
expenses. operating earnings increased by $78 million as a result of lower expenses, primarily due to lower costs as a result of the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture.
other. annuities reinsurance activity with affiliates that are included in the brighthouse financial segment decreased operating earnings by $160 million. this was primarily due to the aforementioned recapture of certain single-premium deferred annuity reinsurance agreements that resulted in unfavorable recapture settlements and an increase in the related dac amortization, partially offset by lower interest credited on the related reinsurance payables. the impact of the lower interest credited was largely offset by the lower net investment income earned on the assets transferred in connection with the recapture. unfavorable results from our reinsurance agreement with our former operating joint venture in japan resulted in a $14 million decrease in operating earnings.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014
unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.
business growth. a larger invested asset base, driven by positive net flows in our life business and an increase in allocated equity, generated higher net investment income. this was partially offset by higher interest credited on long-duration contracts consistent with the growth in average invested assets in our long-term care product. declines in broker-dealer revenue also decreased operating earnings. the combined impact of the items discussed above increased operating earnings by $45 million.
market factors. market factors, including sustained low interest rates and volatile equity markets, continued to impact our investment yields. the sustained low interest rate environment resulted in a decline in net investment income on our fixed maturity securities as proceeds from maturing investments were reinvested at lower yields. this reduction in 2015 income from lower yields was partially offset by lower interest credited expense in our deferred annuities business as a result of declines in average interest credited rates. the decline in yields was also partially offset by higher returns on real estate, real estate joint ventures and alternative investments. the changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $182 million decrease in operating earnings.
127
underwriting, actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments. less favorable mortality in both our universal life and traditional life businesses resulted in a net decrease of $40 million in operating earnings. favorable claims experience in our long-term care business, due to higher net closures and the impact of lapses on certain insurance-related liabilities, increased operating earnings by $16 million. on an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and dac. these annual updates, which occurred in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $77 million and were primarily related to unfavorable dac unlockings in the life businesses. refinements to dac and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both 2015 and 2014 resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $14 million, primarily driven by certain 2014 adjustments in both our life and annuity businesses. the 2014 refinements include favorable reserve adjustments related to disability premium waivers and a charge related to delayed settlement interest on unclaimed funds held by state governments.
expenses. a $23 million increase in expenses was primarily related to higher employee-related and project-related costs.
other. favorable results from our reinsurance agreement with our former operating joint venture in japan contributed $38 million to operating earnings. annuities reinsurance activity with affiliates that are reported in the brighthouse financial segment had a net unfavorable impact to operating earnings of $18 million.
brighthouse financial business overview. sales from our life business decreased by 27% from 2015, primarily as a result of the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture. annuity sales decreased by 23%, primarily driven by a 42% decrease in variable annuity sales as a result of the proposed separation and the suspension of sales through one distributor. in our annuities business, despite positive market performance in 2016, average separate account balances decreased primarily due to higher negative net flows and the impact of a significant equity market decline in the third quarter of 2015, which was not fully reflected in the 2015 average asset balance.

year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015
unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.
business growth. a $228 million increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth, primarily due to higher net investment income resulting from a larger invested asset base. almost half of this increase resulted from the recapture of reinsurance agreements (from an affiliate that is included in the metlife holdings segment) covering certain single-premium deferred annuity contracts, with the remainder due primarily to a capital contribution from metlife, inc. in early 2016 and positive net flows in our general account from our annuities and life businesses, partially offset by funding agreement repayments in our run-off business.
128
market factors. market factors, including low interest rates, volatile equity markets, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our investment yields; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. investment yields on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio were invested at lower yields than the portfolio average. additionally, we recognized lower returns on real estate joint ventures and lower investment earnings on our securities lending program primarily as a result of lower margins due to the impact of a flatter yield curve. these unfavorable yield impacts were partially offset by higher income on derivatives. higher returns on other limited partnership interests also increased income. in our annuities business, lower equity returns in 2015 drove a decline in our average separate account balances which resulted in a decrease in asset-based fee income in 2016 relative to 2015. in addition, we experienced higher costs associated with our variable annuity gmdbs, partially offset by lower average interest crediting rates on deferred annuities and lower dac amortization. the changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $225 million decrease in operating earnings.
underwriting, actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments. unfavorable mortality experience in our universal life business and less favorable mortality experience in our income annuities business, as compared to 2015, resulted in a net decrease in operating earnings of $82 million. the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review, which occurred in both 2016 and 2015, resulted in a net operating earnings decrease of $79 million and was primarily related to unfavorable dac unlockings in our variable annuity business. refinements, primarily to dac and certain insurance-related liabilities recorded in 2016, resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $467 million. this decrease was primarily driven by a $254 million charge in the third quarter of 2016, mostly recognized as a write-off of dac, and an $86 million increase in our insurance-related liabilities over the third and fourth quarters of 2016, both due to loss recognition testing upon re-segmentation, as well as a reserve adjustment of $171 million resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process in our universal life business.
expenses and taxes. operating earnings increased due to a decrease in expenses of $20 million, primarily driven by the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture and lower project-related costs, partially offset by higher amortization of software expenses. in 2016, we realized lower tax benefits of $46 million, primarily related to the separate account dividends received deduction.
other. annuities reinsurance activity with an affiliate that is included in the metlife holdings segment increased operating earnings by $160 million. this was primarily due to the aforementioned recapture of certain single-premium deferred annuity reinsurance agreements that resulted in favorable recapture settlements and the recovery of dac, partially offset by lower interest credited on the related reinsurance receivables. the impact of the lower interest credited was largely offset by the higher net investment income, noted above, earned on the assets transferred in connection with the same recapture.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014
unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.
business growth. an $88 million increase in operating earnings was attributable to business growth. net investment income increased primarily due to a higher average invested asset base from positive net flows in our life business, partially offset by funding agreement repayments in our run-off business. lower dac amortization was driven by lower average separate account balances in our deferred annuity business. a decrease in policyholder account balances in our run-off business resulted in lower interest credited expense. these increases were partially offset by lower asset-based fees resulting from the lower average separate account balances in our deferred annuities business.
market factors. a $30 million decrease in operating earnings was attributable to market factors, including equity markets and interest rates. higher dac amortization due to lower equity market performance was partially offset by favorable impacts from interest rate movements. higher interest credited resulted primarily from higher crediting rates on funding agreement renewals in our run-off business. while separate account fund returns were down slightly on a full year basis, the positive returns in the first half of the year drove an increase in our average separate account balances which resulted in higher asset-based fee income.
underwriting, actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments. favorable mortality in our term life, income annuities and traditional life businesses resulted in an increase in operating earnings of $50 million. on an annual basis, we review and update our long-term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance-related liabilities and dac. these annual updates, which occurred in both 2015 and 2014, resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of $41 million, primarily related to unfavorable dac unlockings in the life businesses. other refinements to dac and insurance-related liabilities decreased operating earnings by $13 million, primarily due to a favorable adjustment recognized in 2014 related to refinements in reserve calculations for traditional life disability waiver premiums.
129
expenses. higher expenses decreased operating earnings by $46 million, primarily due to the impact from a benefit recorded in 2014 for affiliated reinsurance recapture activity in our life business, as well as higher allocated costs related to sales and service support, partially offset by lower project-related costs.
other. annuities reinsurance activity with an affiliate that is part of the metlife holdings segment had a net favorable impact to operating earnings of $18 million. this includes recapture activity in 2014 and reflects the favorable increase in the amortization of deferred ceded commissions on new treaties, favorable recapture settlements, as well as lower net guarantee reserves partially offset by a net drop in guarantee fees and unfavorable changes in deposit fund balances for certain variable annuity treaties, which include the base contract. in addition, operating earnings decreased $56 million, as a result of there being no activity in 2015 related to an agreement reinsuring certain variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits originally assumed from our former operating joint venture in japan, which we exited in november 2014 through novation.

other business activities. operating earnings from other business activities increased $36 million. this was primarily related to improved results from our start-up operations.
other net investment income. a $50 million decrease in other net investment income was primarily driven by lower returns on fixed maturity securities as a result of the low interest rate environment and a decrease in average total portfolio holdings, primarily driven by a capital contribution to metlife usa which is reported in the brighthouse financial segment. additionally, lower returns on real estate, real estate joint ventures and private equities decreased other net investment income.
preferred stock dividends. preferred stock dividends decreased by $13 million. in june 2015, metlife, inc. repurchased its 6.50% non-cumulative preferred stock, series b (the "series b preferred stock") on which dividends had been paid quarterly. also in june 2015, metlife, inc. issued 1,500,000 shares of its 5.25% fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative preferred stock, series c (the "series c preferred stock") on which dividends are payable semi-annually until june 15, 2020, and are payable quarterly thereafter.
corporate initiatives and projects. expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects decreased by $40 million, primarily due to lower costs associated with enterprise-wide initiatives taken by the company.
incremental tax benefit. corporate & other benefits from the impact of certain permanent tax preferenced items, including non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. as a result, our effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory rate of 35%. in 2016, we had higher utilization of tax preferenced investments, which increased our operating earnings by $69 million over 2015. in addition, our results for 2016 include a tax benefit of $46 million for tax audit settlements and $22 million related to an investment tax credit. our 2015 results included the aforementioned tax charge of $557 million, which was recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties.
other. our 2015 results include the aforementioned $235 million charge for interest on uncertain tax positions. in 2016, operating earnings decreased by $35 million as a result of net adjustments to certain reinsurance assets and liabilities. in addition, operating earnings decreased $27 million due to higher employee-related costs, including those related to the separation. an impairment charge on a real estate property in 2015, partially offset by higher real estate costs in 2016, increased operating earnings by $10 million.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014
unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.
other business activities. operating earnings from other business activities decreased $29 million primarily due to lower operating earnings from start-up operations.
131
other net investment income. a $168 million decrease in other net investment income was driven by an increase in the amount credited to the segments due to growth in the economic capital managed by corporate & other on their behalf. this decrease was also impacted by the sustained low interest rate environment, which drove lower investment yields on fixed maturity securities and lower returns on alternative investments. this was partially offset by increased income from higher average invested assets and improved returns on real estate investments.
interest expense on debt. interest expense on debt increased by $24 million, mainly due to the issuance of $1.5 billion of senior notes in march 2015 and $1.25 billion of senior notes in november 2015.
incremental tax benefit (expense). corporate & other benefits from the impact of certain permanent tax differences, including non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing. as a result, our effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory rate of 35%. our 2015 results include the aforementioned tax charge of $557 million, which was recorded under accounting guidance for the recognition of tax uncertainties. our 2014 results include an $18 million tax charge related to a portion of the settlement of a licensing matter that was not deductible for income tax purposes. in addition, in 2015, we had higher utilization of tax preferenced investments, a benefit related to the timing of certain tax credits and other tax benefits, which increased our operating earnings by $62 million over 2014.
other. our 2015 results include the aforementioned charge of $235 million for interest on uncertain tax positions, as well as a $20 million charge associated with company use real estate. these increases in expenses were partially offset by lower corporate expenses of $30 million, a $21 million tax refund received for a favorable outcome on prior year tax audits and a decrease in employee-related costs of $22 million. our results for 2014 include a $117 million accrual to increase the litigation reserve related to asbestos and charges totaling $57 million related to the settlement of a licensing matter with the nydfs and the district attorney, new york county.
effects of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company's consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates.
an increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. during inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses, which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation. prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.

investments investment risks our primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. the investments department, led by the chief investment officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. the investments risk committee, chaired by grm, reviews and monitors investment risk limits and tolerances. we are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks:
•   credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest;
•   interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. changes in market interest rates will impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds;
•   liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments, in times of strained market conditions;
•   market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads and equity market levels. a widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher otti. credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed maturity securities and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio;
•   currency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments. this risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. in general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the u.s. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and
•   real estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the demand and supply of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of borrowers and their tenants and joint venture partners, capital markets volatility and inherent interest rate movements.
we manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. we also manage credit risk, market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. risk limits to promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit and equity risk exposure, as measured by our economic capital framework, are approved annually by a committee of directors that oversees our investment portfolio. for real estate assets, we manage credit risk and market valuation risk through geographic, property type and product type diversification and asset allocation. we manage interest rate risk as part of our alm strategies. these strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that reflects the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and utilizing product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, to manage interest rate risk. we also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain non-guaranteed elements of our products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. in addition to hedging with foreign currency derivatives, we manage currency risk by matching much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. we also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, and market valuation risk.
we use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio. generally, we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own. in certain cases, basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own. for example, we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations. in such instances, the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio. in addition, our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging. however, we dynamically hedge this risk through the rebalancing and rollover of our credit default swaps at their most liquid tenors. we believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as effective economic hedges of our credit exposure.
133
we enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities. for credit default swaps covering north american corporate issuers, credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money. for european corporate issuers, credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring. with respect to credit default contracts on western european sovereign debt, credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, or involuntary restructuring. in each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the credit derivatives determinations committee of the international swaps and derivatives association determines that a credit event has occurred.
current environment the global economy and markets continue to be affected by stress and volatility, which has adversely affected the financial services sector, in particular, and global capital markets. recently, political and/or economic instability in the u.k., mexico, italy, turkey and puerto rico have contributed to global market volatility. events following the u.k.'s referendum on june 23, 2016 and the uncertainties associated with its pending withdrawal from the eu have contributed to market volatility. see "- industry trends - financial and economic environment."
as a global insurance company, we are affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world. see "- industry trends - financial and economic environment" for further information on such measures, as well as for information regarding actions taken by japan's central government and the bank of japan to boost inflation expectations and achieve sustainable economic growth in japan. see also "- industry trends - impact of a sustained low interest rate environment" for information regarding the december 2015 and december 2016 actions taken by the fomc to raise the federal funds rate. the federal reserve may take further actions to influence interest rates in the future, which may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may adversely impact the level of product sales. see "risk factors - economic environment and capital markets-related risks - we are exposed to significant global financial and capital markets risks which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause our net investment income to vary from period to period."
european investments we maintain general account investments in europe to support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities in these countries and certain of our non-european operations invest in europe for diversification. in europe, we have proactively mitigated risk in both direct and indirect exposures by investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality investments with a focus on the higher-rated countries, including the u.k., germany, france, the netherlands, poland, norway and sweden. the sovereign debt of these countries continues to maintain investment grade credit ratings from all major rating agencies. european sovereign fixed maturity securities, at estimated fair value, were $8.5 billion at december 31, 2016. our european corporate securities (fixed maturity and perpetual hybrid securities classified as non-redeemable preferred stock) are invested in a diversified portfolio of primarily non-financial services securities, which comprised $19.7 billion, or 67%, of european total corporate securities, at estimated fair value, at december 31, 2016. of these european fixed maturity securities, 94% were investment grade and, for the 6% that were below investment grade, the majority were non-financial services corporate securities at december 31, 2016. european financial services corporate securities, at estimated fair value, were $9.9 billion (including $6.7 billion within the banking sector) with 98% investment grade, at december 31, 2016. total european fixed maturity securities, at estimated fair value, were $38.9 billion at december 31, 2016, including $770 million of structured securities.
selected country investments recent country specific volatility due to local economic and/or political concerns has affected the performance of certain of our investments. see "- industry trends - financial and economic environment."
we have exposure to such volatility, as we maintain general account investments in the selected countries as summarized below to support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities in these countries and we also have exposure through our global portfolio diversification.

(2)   our exposure to puerto rico sovereigns is in the form of political subdivision fixed maturity securities and is composed completely of revenue bonds. we have no puerto rico general obligation bonds.
we manage direct and indirect investment exposure in the selected countries through fundamental credit analysis and we continually monitor and adjust our level of investment exposure. we do not expect that our general account investments in these countries will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
current environment summary all of these factors have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of companies in the financial services industry, including metlife. such global economic conditions, as well as the global financial markets, continue to impact our net investment income, net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), level of unrealized gains (losses) within the various asset classes in our investment portfolio, and our level of investment in lower yielding cash equivalents, short-term investments and government securities. see "- industry trends" and "risk factors - economic environment and capital markets-related risks - we are exposed to significant global financial and capital markets risks which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and may cause our net investment income to vary from period to period."

investment portfolio results the following yield table presents the yield and net investment income for our investment portfolio for the periods indicated. yields are calculated using reported net investment income which is not adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. as described below, this table reflects certain differences from the presentation of net investment income presented in the gaap consolidated statements of operations. this yield table presentation is consistent with how we measure our investment performance for management purposes, and we believe it enhances understanding of our investment portfolio results.

(1)   yields are calculated as investment income as a percent of average quarterly asset carrying values. investment income excludes recognized gains and losses and reflects gaap adjustments presented in footnote (6) below. asset carrying values exclude unrealized gains (losses), collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, freestanding derivative assets, collateral received from derivative counterparties, the effects of consolidating certain variable interest entities ("vies") under gaap that are treated as consolidated securitization entities ("cses") and contractholder-directed unit-linked investments. a yield is not presented for other invested assets as it is not considered a meaningful measure of performance for this asset class.
(2)   investment income includes amounts from fvo and trading securities of $37 million, $21 million and $103 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
(3)   investment income from fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans includes prepayment fees.
(4)   yield calculations include the net investment income and ending carrying values of the divested businesses, as well as lag elimination.
(5)   net investment income included in yield calculations include earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment ("investment hedge adjustments"). the investment hedge adjustments presented in the table below exclude cash settlements of $1 million, $0 and $1 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

perpetual securities are included within fixed maturity and equity securities. upon acquisition, we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities if the securities have an interest rate step-up feature which, when combined with other qualitative factors, indicates that the securities have more debt-like characteristics; while those with more equity-like characteristics are classified as equity securities. many of such securities, commonly referred to as "perpetual hybrid securities," have been issued by non-u.s. financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies (i.e. core capital, or "tier 1 capital" and perpetual deferrable securities, or "upper tier 2 capital").
redeemable preferred stock with a stated maturity is included within fixed maturity securities. these securities, which are commonly referred to as "capital securities," primarily have cumulative interest deferral features and are primarily issued by u.s. financial institutions.
in connection with our investment management business, we manage privately-placed and infrastructure fixed maturity securities on behalf of institutional clients, which are unaffiliated investors. these privately-placed and infrastructure fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of $8.0 billion and $6.1 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. as these assets are managed on behalf of, and owned by, our institutional clients, they are not included in our consolidated financial statements.
during 2016, we commenced management of below investment grade fixed maturity securities on behalf of institutional clients, which are unaffiliated investors. these fixed maturity securities had an estimated fair value of $316 million at december 31, 2016. as these assets are managed on behalf of, and owned by, our institutional clients, they are not included in our consolidated financial statements.
also in connection with our investment management business, we manage index investment portfolios that track the return of industry fixed income and equity market indices such as the barclay's u.s. aggregate bond index and s&p 500® index. these assets had an estimated fair value of $27.2 billion and $26.0 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included within separate account assets in our consolidated financial statements.
valuation of securities. we are responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of our investments. we determine the estimated fair value of publicly-traded securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets, independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations. we determine the estimated fair value of privately-placed securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: market standard internal matrix pricing, market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques, or independent pricing services (after we determine the independent pricing services' use of available observable market data). for publicly-traded securities, the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument. generally, we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy. independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies. when a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service, management values the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques, and non-binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities. independent non-binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data. as shown in the following section, less than 1% of our fixed maturity securities were valued using non-binding quotations from independent brokers at december 31, 2016.
senior management, independent of the trading and investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies, including reviewing and approving new transaction types and markets, for ensuring that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our valuation controls and procedures including our formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value.
we have reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of our securities. based on the results of this review and investment class analysis, each instrument is categorized as level 1, 2 or 3 based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs by level within the three level fair value hierarchy by major classes of invested assets.

the composition of fair value pricing sources for and significant changes in level 3 securities at december 31, 2016 are as follows:
•   the majority of the level 3 fixed maturity and equity securities afs were concentrated in three sectors: united states and foreign corporate securities and residential mortgage-backed securities ("rmbs").
•   level 3 fixed maturity securities are priced principally through market standard valuation methodologies, independent pricing services and, to a much lesser extent, independent non-binding broker quotations using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. level 3 fixed maturity securities consist of less liquid securities with very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation methodologies. level 3 fixed maturity securities include: sub-prime rmbs; certain below investment grade private securities and less liquid investment grade corporate securities (included in united states and foreign corporate securities) and less liquid asset-backed securities ("abs") and foreign government securities.
•   during the year ended december 31, 2016, level 3 fixed maturity securities increased by $295 million, or 1%. the increase was driven by purchases in excess of sales and an increase in estimated fair value recognized in oci.

fixed maturity securities credit quality - ratings the securities valuation office of the naic evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called "naic designations." if no designation is available from the naic, then, as permitted by the naic, an internally developed designation is used. the naic designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the nrsro for fixed maturity securities, except for certain structured securities as described below. rating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the naic credit rating provider list, including moody's, s&p, fitch, dominion bond rating service, a.m. best, kroll bond rating agency, egan jones ratings company and morningstar, inc. ("morningstar"). if no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.
the naic has adopted revised methodologies for certain structured securities comprised of non-agency rmbs, commercial mortgage-backed securities ("cmbs") and abs. the naic's objective with the revised methodologies for these structured securities was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities. the revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from structured securities. we apply the revised naic methodologies to structured securities held by metlife, inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the naic statutory basis of accounting. the naic's present methodology is to evaluate structured securities held by insurers using the revised naic methodologies on an annual basis. if metlife, inc.'s insurance subsidiaries acquire structured securities that have not been previously evaluated by the naic, but are expected to be evaluated by the naic in the upcoming annual review, an internally developed designation is used until a final designation becomes available. these revised naic designations may not correspond to nrsro ratings.
the following table presents total fixed maturity securities by nrsro rating and the applicable naic designation from the naic published comparison of nrsro ratings to naic designations, except for certain structured securities, which are presented using the revised naic methodologies as described above, as well as the percentage, based on estimated fair value that each naic designation is comprised of at:

collateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgages into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage or collection of mortgages. the monthly mortgage payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.
the majority of our rmbs holdings were rated aaa/aaa by moody's, s&p or fitch; and were designated naic 1 by the naic at december 31, 2016 and 2015. agency rmbs were guaranteed or otherwise supported by federal national mortgage association, federal home loan mortgage corporation or government national mortgage association. non-agency rmbs include prime, alternative residential mortgage loans ("alt-a") and sub-prime rmbs. prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of residential mortgage loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. alt-a is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime. sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles.
included within prime and alt-a rmbs are re-securitization of real estate mortgage investment conduit ("re-remic") securities. re-remic rmbs involve the pooling of previous issues of prime and alt-a rmbs and restructuring the combined pools to create new senior and subordinated securities. the credit enhancement on the senior tranches is improved through the re-securitization.
historically, we have managed our exposure to sub-prime rmbs holdings by focusing primarily on senior tranche securities, stress testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. our sub-prime rmbs portfolio consists predominantly of securities that were purchased after 2012 at significant discounts to par value and discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. the vast majority of these securities are investment grade under the naic designations (e.g., naic 1 and naic 2). the estimated fair value of our sub-prime rmbs holdings purchased since 2012 was $4.6 billion and $4.0 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with unrealized gains (losses) of $140 million and $74 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

overview of fixed maturity and equity security otti losses recognized in earnings impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities were $206 million, $130 million and $96 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. impairments of fixed maturity securities were $129 million, $90 million and $60 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. impairments of equity securities were $77 million, $40 million and $36 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
credit-related impairments of fixed maturity securities were $118 million, $90 million and $60 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
explanations of changes in fixed maturity and equity securities impairments are as follows:
year ended december 31, 2016 compared with the year ended december 31, 2015
overall otti losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities were $206 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to $130 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the most significant increase in otti losses were in u.s. and foreign corporate securities and common stock, which comprised $180 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, as compared to $93 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. an increase of $87 million in otti losses on u.s. and foreign corporate securities and common stock was concentrated in industrial securities and was the result of lower oil prices impacting the energy sector.
year ended december 31, 2015 compared with the year ended december 31, 2014
overall otti losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities were $130 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to $96 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the most significant decrease in otti losses were in u.s. and foreign corporate securities, which comprised $54 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared to $9 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. an increase of $45 million in otti losses on u.s. and foreign corporate securities reflected the impact of weakening foreign currencies on non-functional currency denominated fixed maturity securities and lower oil prices impacting the energy sector. the $45 million increase in otti losses on u.s. and foreign corporate securities was concentrated in the utility and consumer services industries.

future impairments future otti will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), and changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation, interest rates and credit spreads. if economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, otti may be incurred in upcoming periods.
fvo and trading securities fvo and trading securities are primarily comprised of securities for which the fvo has been elected ("fvo securities"). fvo securities include contractholder-directed investments supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities which do not qualify for presentation as separate account summary total assets and liabilities, certain fixed maturity and equity securities held-for-investment by the general account to support alm strategies for certain insurance products and investments in certain separate accounts; securities held by cses; and trading securities, as further described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. in 2016, the company reinvested its trading securities portfolio into other asset classes and, at december 31, 2016, the company no longer held any actively traded securities. fvo and trading securities were $13.9 billion and $15.0 billion at estimated fair value, or 2.7% and 3.0% of total cash and invested assets, at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the fvo and trading securities fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for fvo and trading securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (level 3) inputs.
securities lending we participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. we obtain collateral, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, which is obtained at the inception of a loan and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. we monitor the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan. securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. we are liable to return to our counterparties the cash collateral under our control. security collateral on deposit from counterparties may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the consolidated financial statements. these transactions are treated as financing arrangements and the associated cash collateral liability is recorded at the amount of the cash received.
see "- liquidity and capital resources - the company - liquidity and capital uses - securities lending" and note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our securities lending program.
repurchase agreement transactions the company participates in short-term repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. under these agreements, the company lends fixed maturity securities and receives cash as collateral in an amount generally equal to 85% to 100% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned at the inception of the transaction. the associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash received. the company monitors the estimated fair value of the collateral and the securities loaned throughout the duration of the transaction and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee.
see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our repurchase agreement transactions.

mortgage loan credit quality - monitoring process. we monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for tables that present mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans, as well as impaired mortgage loans. see "- real estate and real estate joint ventures" for real estate acquired through foreclosure.
we review our commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. these reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios and tenant creditworthiness. the monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. the monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios, including reviews on a geographic and sector basis. we review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related valuation allowance methodology.
147
loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. loan-to-value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. loan-to-value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. a loan-to-value ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. a loan-to-value ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. the debt service coverage ratio compares a property's net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. for our commercial mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 52% at both december 31, 2016 and 2015, and our average debt service coverage ratio was 2.6x at both december 31, 2016 and 2015. the debt service coverage ratio, as well as the values utilized in calculating the ratio, is updated annually on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. in addition, the loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. for our agricultural mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 43% at both december 31, 2016 and 2015. the values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan-to-value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated.
mortgage loan valuation allowances. our valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but for which we expect to incur a loss. accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses.
the determination of the amount of valuation allowances is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with our loan portfolios. such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors, including our experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. these evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the valuation allowance. positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance.
see notes 1, 8 and 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about how valuation allowances are established and monitored, activity in and balances of the valuation allowance, and the estimated fair value of impaired mortgage loans and related impairments included within net investment gains (losses) as of and for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
real estate and real estate joint ventures we diversify our real estate investments by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration. of our real estate investments, excluding funds, 72% were located in the united states, with the remaining 28% located outside the united states, at december 31, 2016. the carrying value of our real estate investments, excluding funds, located in japan, california and district of columbia were 24%, 16% and 9%, respectively, of total real estate investments, excluding funds, at december 31, 2016. real estate funds, including those classified within traditional, were 12% of our real estate investments, at december 31, 2016. the majority of these funds hold underlying real estate investments that are well diversified across the united states.

our private placement unit originated $10.2 billion and $9.2 billion of private investments, comprised primarily of certain privately placed fixed maturity securities, during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the carrying value of such private investments included within our consolidated balance sheets was $50.6 billion and $46.6 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015.
in addition, we originated $339 million and $480 million of tax credit and renewable energy partnerships during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the carrying value of such tax credit and renewable energy partnerships included on our consolidated balance sheets was $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
derivatives derivative risks we are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. we use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for:
•   a comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.
•   information about the gross notional amount, estimated fair value, and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at december 31, 2016 and 2015.
•   the statement of operations effects of derivatives in net investments in foreign operations, cash flow, fair value, or nonqualifying hedge relationships for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
see "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - management of market risk exposures - hedging activities" for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program.
fair value hierarchy see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy.
the valuation of level 3 derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of level 1 and level 2 derivatives. although level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. the use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income.
derivatives categorized as level 3 at december 31, 2016 include: interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates; foreign currency swaps and forwards with certain unobservable inputs, including the unobservable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; and equity index options with unobservable correlation inputs. at december 31, 2016, less than 1% of the estimated fair value of our derivatives was priced through independent broker quotations.
see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (level 3) inputs.
the gain (loss) on level 3 derivatives primarily relates to interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates; certain purchased equity index options that are valued using models dependent on an unobservable market correlation input, equity variance swaps that are valued using observable equity volatility data plus an unobservable equity variance spread and foreign currency swaps and forwards that are valued using an unobservable portion of the swap yield curves. other significant inputs, which are observable, include equity index levels, equity volatility and the swap yield curves. we validate the reasonableness of these inputs by valuing the positions using internal models and comparing the results to broker quotations.
151
the gain (loss) on level 3 derivatives, percentage of gain (loss) attributable to observable and unobservable inputs, and the primary drivers of observable gain (loss) are summarized as follows:
year ended december 31, 2016
gain (loss) recognized in net income (loss)                     ($734) million percentage of gain (loss) attributable to observable inputs     120%
primary drivers of observable gain (loss)                       increases in interest rates on interest rate total return swaps; decreases in certain equity volatility levels; and increases in certain equity index levels; partially offset by weakening of the u.s. dollar versus foreign currencies on receive inflation-linked foreign currency, pay u.s. dollar forwards and swaps.
percentage of gain (loss) attributable to unobservable inputs   (20%)
see "- summary of critical accounting estimates - derivatives" for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect derivatives.
credit risk see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to derivatives and for the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral.
our policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. this policy applies to the recognition of derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets, and does not affect our legal right of offset.

(1)   gains (losses) are reported in net derivative gains (losses), except for gains (losses) on the trading portfolio, which are reported in net investment income.
(2)   the gross gains and gross (losses) for purchased credit default swaps in the trading portfolio were $4 million and ($4) million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and $8 million and ($11) million, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2015.
(3)   the gross gains and gross (losses) for written credit default swaps in the trading portfolio were $3 million and ($3) million, respectively, for both of the years ended december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015.
(4)   gains (losses) do not include earned income (expense) on credit default swaps.
the unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on purchased credit default swaps of ($44) million was due to certain credit spreads on credit default swaps hedging certain bonds, narrowing in the current period as compared to the prior period. the favorable change in net gains (losses) on written credit default swaps of $164 million was due to certain credit spreads on certain credit default swaps used as replications narrowing in the current period as compared to the prior period.
the maximum amount at risk related to our written credit default swaps is equal to the corresponding gross notional amount. in a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by state insurance regulators and the naic and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the company. in order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. in some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. for example, by purchasing treasury bonds (or other high-quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our alm needs. in addition, given the shorter tenor of the credit default swaps (generally five-year tenors) versus a long-dated corporate bond, we have more flexibility in managing our credit exposures.

off-balance sheet arrangements credit and committed facilities we maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as committed facilities, with various financial institutions. brighthouse maintains an unsecured term loan agreement and an unsecured revolving credit facility with various financial institutions. see "- liquidity and capital resources - the company - liquidity and capital sources - global funding sources - credit and committed facilities" for further descriptions of such arrangements. for the classification of expenses on such credit and committed facilities and the nature of the associated liability for letters of credit issued and drawdowns on these credit and committed facilities, see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
collateral for securities lending, third-party custodian administered repurchase programs and derivatives we participate in a securities lending program in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. periodically we receive non-cash collateral for securities lending from counterparties on deposit from customers, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. the amount of this collateral was $46 million and $50 million at estimated fair value at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see notes 1 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, as well as "- investments - securities lending" for discussion of our securities lending program, the classification of revenues and expenses, and the nature of the secured financing arrangement and associated liability.
we also participate in third-party custodian administered repurchase programs for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. we loan certain of our fixed maturity securities to financial institutions and, in exchange, non-cash collateral is put on deposit by the financial institutions on our behalf with third-party custodians. the estimated fair value of securities loaned in connection with these transactions was $382 million and $738 million at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively. non-cash collateral on deposit with third-party custodians on our behalf was $401 million and $781 million at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015, respectively, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.
we enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. we have non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. the amount of this non-cash collateral was $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. see "- liquidity and capital resources - the company - liquidity and capital uses - pledged collateral" and "derivatives" in note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the earned income on and the gross notional amount, estimated fair value of assets and liabilities and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives.
lease commitments as lessee, we have entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space, information technology and other equipment. our commitments under such lease agreements are included within the contractual obligations table. see "- liquidity and capital resources - the company - contractual obligations" and note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
guarantees see "guarantees" in note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
other we enter into the following additional commitments in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio: mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. see "net investment income" and "net investment gains (losses)" in note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on the investment income, investment expense, and gains and losses from such investments. see also "- investments - fixed maturity and equity securities afs" and "- investments - mortgage loans" for information on our investments in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. see "- investments - real estate and real estate joint ventures" and "- investments - other limited partnership interests" for information on our partnership investments.
154
other than the commitments disclosed in note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, there are no other material obligations or liabilities arising from the commitments to fund mortgage loans, partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans, and private corporate bond investments. for further information on commitments to fund partnership investments, mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments, see "- liquidity and capital resources - the company - contractual obligations."
insolvency assessments see note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
policyholder liabilities we establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations or to provide for future annuity payments. amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap. for more details on policyholder liabilities, see "- summary of critical accounting estimates."
due to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities, we cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future.
we periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience. we revise estimates, to the extent permitted or required under gaap, if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities. we charge or credit changes in our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are established or re-estimated. if the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them. such an increase could adversely affect our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we have experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism, as well as turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils. we also use hedging, reinsurance and other risk management activities to mitigate financial market volatility.
insurance regulators in many of the non-u.s. countries in which we operate require certain metlife entities to prepare a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements, and to submit that analysis to the regulatory authorities.
see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - insurance regulation - policy and contract reserve adequacy analysis" and "business - regulation - international regulation" for further information.
future policy benefits we establish liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. see notes 1 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, "- industry trends - impact of a sustained low interest rate environment - low interest rate scenario" and "- variable annuity guarantees." a discussion of future policy benefits by segment (as well as corporate & other) follows.
155
u.s.
amounts payable under insurance policies for this segment are comprised of group insurance and annuities, as well as property & casualty policies. for group insurance, future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance, active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under life insurance contracts. for group annuity contracts, future policyholder benefits are primarily related to payout annuities, including pension risk transfers, structured settlement annuities and institutional income annuities. there is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. as a result, a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various alm strategies, including the use of various interest rate derivative positions. the components of future policy benefits related to our property & casualty policies are liabilities for unpaid claims, estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies, levels of severities, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes or regulatory decisions. assumptions are based upon our historical experience and analysis of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business, and we consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.
asia future policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for traditional life, endowment, annuity and accident & health contracts. they are also held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products. they include certain liabilities for variable annuity and variable life guarantees of minimum death benefits, and longevity guarantees. factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at policy issuance, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. we mitigate our risks by applying various alm strategies.
latin america future policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for immediate annuities in chile, argentina and mexico and traditional life contracts mainly in mexico, brazil and colombia. there are also liabilities held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products in mexico. factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at policy issuance, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, and mortality and lapses different than expected. we mitigate our risks by applying various alm strategies.
emea future policy benefits for this segment include unearned premium reserves for group life and credit insurance contracts. future policy benefits are also held for traditional life, endowment and annuity contracts with significant mortality risk and accident & health contracts. factors impacting these liabilities include lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. we mitigate our risks by having premiums which are adjustable or cancellable in some cases, and by applying various alm strategies.
metlife holdings future policy benefits for the life business are comprised mainly of liabilities for traditional life and for universal and variable life insurance contracts. in order to manage risk, we have often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on life insurance policies. the reinsurance programs are routinely evaluated and this may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage. we have entered into various interest rate derivative positions to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts. for the annuities business, future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income annuities, and liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits which are accounted for as insurance. other future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, and active life policies. in addition, for our other products, future policyholder benefits related to the reinsurance of our former japan joint venture are comprised of liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits which are accounted for as insurance.

policyholder account balances in this segment are comprised of funding agreements, retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs.
group benefits policyholder account balances in this business are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs. policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate we determine, which is influenced by current market rates. a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. we have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario.

retirement and income solutions policyholder account balances in this business are comprised of funding agreements. interest crediting rates vary by type of contract, and can be fixed or variable. variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index, most commonly (1-month or 3-month) libor. we are exposed to interest rate risks, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk, when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date. we may invest in floating rate assets or enter into receive-floating interest rate swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as caps, to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. we also mitigate our risks by applying various alm strategies and seek to hedge all foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency hedges, including cross currency swaps.

as a result of acquisitions, we establish additional liabilities known as excess interest reserves for policies with credited rates in excess of market rates as of the applicable acquisition dates. at december 31, 2016, excess interest reserves were $418 million for the brighthouse financial segment.
variable annuity guarantees we issue, directly and through assumed business, certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit base) less withdrawals. in some cases, the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or optional market value resets. see notes 1 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
certain guarantees, including portions thereof, have insurance liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits. guarantees accounted for in this manner include gmdbs, the life-contingent portion of certain gmwbs, and the non-life contingent portions of both gmwbs and gmibs that require annuitization. these liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns. the scenarios are based on best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize dac. when current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected, liabilities will increase, resulting in a current period charge to net income. the opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected. at each reporting period, we update the actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings.
certain guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as embedded derivatives, are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances. guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include gmabs, and the non-life contingent portions of both gmwbs and gmibs that do not require annuitization. the estimated fair values of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. the projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. a risk neutral valuation methodology is used to project the cash flows from the guarantees under multiple capital market scenarios to determine an economic liability. the reported estimated fair value is then determined by taking the present value of these risk-free generated cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates a spread over the risk-free rate to reflect our nonperformance risk and adding a risk margin. for more information on the determination of estimated fair value, see note 10 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

the carrying amounts for guarantees included in policyholder account balances above include nonperformance risk adjustments of $982 million and $462 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. these nonperformance risk adjustments represent the impact of including a credit spread when discounting the underlying risk neutral cash flows to determine the estimated fair values. the nonperformance risk adjustment does not have an economic impact on us as it cannot be monetized given the nature of these policyholder liabilities. the change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk adjustment is not hedged.
the carrying values of these guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity volatility, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. carrying values are also impacted by our assumptions around mortality, separate account returns and policyholder behavior, including lapse rates.
as discussed below, we use a combination of product design, hedging strategies, reinsurance, and other risk management actions to mitigate the risks related to these benefits. within each type of guarantee, there is a range of product offerings reflecting the changing nature of these products over time. changes in product features and terms are in part driven by customer demand but, more importantly, reflect our risk management practices of continuously evaluating the guaranteed benefits and their associated asset-liability matching. recently, we have been diversifying the concentration of income benefits in the portfolio of the company's annuities business by focusing on withdrawal benefits, variable annuities without living benefits and index-linked annuities. to this end, the gmibs were no longer available for new purchases after february 19, 2016.
the sections below provide further detail by total account value for certain of our most popular guarantees. total account values include amounts not reported on the consolidated balance sheets from assumed business, contractholder-directed investments which do not qualify for presentation as separate account assets, and amounts included in our general account. the total account values and the net amounts at risk include direct and assumed business, but exclude offsets from hedging or ceded reinsurance, if any.

the annuitization interest rates on gmibs have been decreased from 2.5% to 0.5% over time, partially in response to the low interest rate environment, accompanied by an increase in the setback period from seven years to 10 years and the introduction of a 10-year mortality projection.
additionally, 33% of the $88.8 billion of gmib total account value has been invested in managed volatility funds as of december 31, 2016. these funds seek to manage volatility by adjusting the fund holdings within certain guidelines based on capital market movements. such activity reduces the overall risk of the underlying funds while maintaining their growth opportunities. these risk mitigation techniques translate to a reduction or elimination of the need for us to manage the funds' volatility through hedging or reinsurance.
our gmib products typically have a waiting period of 10 years to be eligible for annuitization. as of december 31, 2016, only 18% of our contracts with gmibs were eligible for annuitization. the remaining contracts are not eligible for annuitization for an average of six years.
once eligible for annuitization, contractholders would only be expected to annuitize if their contracts were in-the-money. we calculate in-the-moneyness with respect to gmibs consistent with net amount at risk as discussed in note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, by comparing the contractholders' income benefits based on total account values and current annuity rates versus the guaranteed income benefits. the net amount at risk was $3,834 million at december 31, 2016, of which $3,641 million was related to gmib guarantees. for those contracts with gmib, the table below presents details of contracts that are in-the-money and out-of-the money at december 31, 2016:

the change in estimated fair values of our derivatives is recorded in policyholder benefits and claims if such derivatives are hedging guarantees included in future policy benefits, and in net derivative gains (losses) if such derivatives are hedging guarantees included in policyholder account balances.
our hedging strategy involves the significant use of static longer-term derivative instruments to avoid the need to execute transactions during periods of market disruption or higher volatility. we continually monitor the capital markets for opportunities to adjust our liability coverage, as appropriate. futures are also used to dynamically adjust the daily coverage levels as markets and liability exposures fluctuate.
we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. certain of our reinsurance agreements and most derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements, both of which significantly reduce the exposure to counterparty risk. in addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other risk management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed.
liquidity and capital resources overview our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. the global markets and economy continue to experience volatility that may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt or equity securities. for further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see "- industry trends" and "- investments - current environment."
liquidity management based upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. we continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for metlife, inc. and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities.
164
short-term liquidity we maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was $14.2 billion and $11.1 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. short-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed, including amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.
liquid assets an integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was $230.7 billion and $229.4 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits and custodial accounts, collateral financing arrangements, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.
capital management we have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process. these committees, including the capital management committee and the enterprise risk committee ("erc"), regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. the capital management committee is comprised of members of senior management, including metlife, inc.'s chief financial officer ("cfo"), treasurer and chief risk officer ("cro"). the erc is also comprised of members of senior management, including metlife, inc.'s cfo, cro and chief investment officer.
our board of directors and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. the capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. all capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the finance and risk committee of the board prior to obtaining full board approval. the board approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions, as required.
see "risk factors - capital-related risks - legal and regulatory restrictions and uncertainty and restrictions under the terms of certain of our securities may prevent us from repurchasing our stock and paying dividends at the level we wish" and note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding restrictions on payment of dividends and stock repurchases. see also "- the company - liquidity and capital uses - common stock repurchases" for information regarding metlife, inc.'s common stock repurchase authorizations.
the company liquidity liquidity refers to the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs. we determine our liquidity needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily. we adjust the asset mix and asset maturities based on this rolling 12-month forecast. to support this forecast, we conduct cash flow and stress testing, which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. we include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products, including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. in the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. these available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources including commercial paper and various credit and committed facilities.
under certain stressful market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements or if we are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. in addition, in the event of such forced sale, for securities in an unrealized loss position, realized losses would be incurred on securities sold and impairments would be incurred, if there is a need to sell securities prior to recovery, which may negatively impact our financial condition. see "risk factors - investment-related risks - should the need arise, we may have difficulty selling certain holdings in our investment portfolio or in our securities lending program in a timely manner and realizing full value given their illiquid nature."
165
in extreme circumstances, all general account assets within a particular legal entity - other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose - are available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity.
capital we manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.
rating agencies rating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to metlife, inc.'s domestic life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to metlife, inc. and certain of its subsidiaries. financial strength ratings represent the opinion of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. credit ratings indicate the rating agency's opinion regarding a debt issuer's ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. they are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. the level and composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our insurer financial strength ratings and credit ratings. each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors. in addition to heightening the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies, rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. see "business - company ratings" for further information on our insurer financial strength ratings.
downgrades in our insurer financial strength ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways. see "risk factors - risk related to business - a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations."
a downgrade in the credit ratings or insurer financial strength ratings of metlife, inc. or its subsidiaries would likely impact us in the following ways, including:
•   impact our ability to generate cash flows from the sale of funding agreements and other capital market products offered by our retirement and income solutions business;
•   impact the cost and availability of financing for metlife, inc. and its subsidiaries; and
•   result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting investments held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. see "- liquidity and capital uses - pledged collateral."
statutory capital and dividends our u.s. insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements.
rbc requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action. rbc is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. the formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. these rules apply to most of our u.s. insurance subsidiaries. state insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain rbc levels. at the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those rbc levels.
as a delaware corporation, american life is subject to delaware law; however, because it does not conduct insurance business in delaware or any other domestic state, it is exempt from rbc requirements under delaware law. american life's operations are also regulated by applicable authorities of the countries in which it operates and is subject to capital and solvency requirements in those countries.
166
the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay to metlife, inc. or to other parent entities is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings and provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in our businesses. we proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital. certain of these activities may require regulatory approval. furthermore, the payment of dividends and other distributions to metlife, inc. and other parent entities by their respective insurance subsidiaries is governed by insurance laws and regulations. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - insurance regulation," "business - regulation - international regulation," "- metlife, inc. - liquidity and capital sources - dividends from subsidiaries" and note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
affiliated captive reinsurance transactions various subsidiaries of metlife, inc. cede specific policy classes, including term and universal life insurance, participating whole life insurance, long-term disability insurance, group life insurance and other business to various wholly-owned captive reinsurers. the reinsurance activities among these affiliated companies are eliminated within our consolidated results of operations. the statutory reserves of such affiliated captive reinsurers are supported by a combination of funds withheld assets, investment assets and letters of credit issued by unaffiliated financial institutions. metlife, inc. has committed to maintain the surplus of several of the domestic affiliated captive reinsurers, as well as provided guarantees of the reinsurers' and other affiliated international insurance entities' repayment obligations on the letters of credit. metlife, inc. has also provided guarantees of these reinsurers' repayment obligations on derivative and certain reinsurance agreements entered into by these reinsurers. see "- metlife, inc. - liquidity and capital uses - support agreements" for further details on certain of these guarantees. various subsidiaries of metlife, inc. enter into reinsurance agreements with affiliated captive reinsurers for risk and capital management purposes, as well as to manage statutory reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies and other business.
the naic continues to review insurance companies' use of affiliated captive reinsurers and off-shore entities. the nydfs continues to have a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions involving captive insurers. we are not aware of any states other than new york and california implementing such a moratorium. while such a moratorium would not impact our existing reinsurance agreements with captive reinsurers, a moratorium placed on the use of captives for new reserve financing transactions could impact our ability to write certain products and/or impact our rbc ratios and ability to deploy excess capital in the future. this could result in our need to increase prices, modify product features or limit the availability of those products to our customers. while this affects insurers across the industry, it could adversely impact our competitive position and our results of operations in the future. we continue to evaluate product modifications, pricing structure and alternative means of managing risks, capital and statutory reserves and we expect the discontinued use of captive reinsurance on new reserve financing transactions would not have a material impact on our future consolidated financial results.
our u.s. variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefit risk and certain other risks were previously ceded to an affiliated captive reinsurer. in november 2014, this captive reinsurer merged with and into metlife usa, further reducing the company's exposure to and use of captive reinsurers. see "risk factors - regulatory and legal risks - our insurance and brokerage businesses are highly regulated, and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth - u.s. regulation - insurance regulation" and note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our reinsurance activities.

cash flows from operations the principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, net investment income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. the principal cash outflows are the result of various life insurance, property & casualty, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. a primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.
cash flows from investments the principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. the principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. additional cash outflows relate to purchases of businesses. we typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our alm discipline to fund insurance liabilities. we closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. the primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption.
168
cash flows from financing the principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. the principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt, payments of dividends on and repurchases of metlife, inc.'s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan. the primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are market disruption and the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.
liquidity and capital sources in addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in "- summary of the company's primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital," the following additional information is provided regarding our primary sources of liquidity and capital:
global funding sources liquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit facilities and commercial paper. capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. the diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. our primary global funding sources include:
preferred stock in june 2015, metlife, inc. issued 1,500,000 shares of series c preferred stock, with a $0.01 par value per share and a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $1.5 billion. see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
common stock in october 2014, metlife, inc. issued 22,907,960 new shares of its common stock for $1.0 billion in connection with the remarketing of senior debt securities and settlement of stock purchase contracts. see "- remarketing of senior debt securities and settlement of stock purchase contracts."
commercial paper, reported in short-term debt metlife, inc. and metlife funding each have a commercial paper program that is supported by our general corporate credit facility (see "- credit and committed facilities"). metlife funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through metlife credit corp., another subsidiary of mlic, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.
federal home loan bank funding agreements, reported in policyholder account balances certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries are members of a regional fhlb. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we issued $21.7 billion, $21.6 billion and $13.9 billion, respectively, and repaid $21.2 billion, $21.1 billion and $14.0 billion, respectively, under funding agreements with certain regional fhlbs. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $16.0 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively. see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

169

other borrowings in december 2015, metlife private equity holdings, llc, a wholly-owned indirect investment subsidiary of mlic, borrowed $350 million under term loans that mature in december 2020. see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
remarketing of senior debt securities and settlement of stock purchase contracts in october 2014, metlife, inc. closed the successful remarketing of $1.0 billion of senior debt securities underlying common equity units issued in november 2010 in connection with the acquisition of alico. metlife, inc. did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing. most common equity unit holders used the remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under the applicable stock purchase contracts. the subsequent settlement of the stock purchase contracts provided proceeds to metlife, inc. of $1.0 billion in october 2014 in exchange for newly issued shares of metlife, inc.'s common stock, as described in "- common stock" above. see note 15 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
credit and committed facilities at december 31, 2016, we maintained a $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and certain committed facilities aggregating $11.5 billion. when drawn upon, these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective agreements.
the unsecured revolving credit facility is used for general corporate purposes, to support the borrowers' commercial paper programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. at december 31, 2016, we had outstanding $730 million in letters of credit and no drawdowns against this facility. remaining availability was $3.3 billion at december 31, 2016.
the committed facilities are used for collateral for certain of our affiliated reinsurance liabilities. at december 31, 2016, $6.0 billion in letters of credit and $2.8 billion in aggregate drawdowns under collateral financing arrangements were outstanding. remaining availability was $2.6 billion at december 31, 2016.
in december 2016, metlife, inc. and metlife funding entered into an agreement to amend their existing $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which provides, among other things, that the facility will be amended and restated upon the completion of the proposed separation and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. as amended and restated, the unsecured revolving credit facility will provide for borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $3.0 billion. all borrowings under this amended revolving credit facility must be repaid by december 20, 2021, except that letters of credit outstanding upon termination may remain outstanding until december 20, 2022.
170
in december 2016, brighthouse financial, inc. entered into a $3.0 billion three-year senior unsecured delayed draw term loan agreement with a bank syndicate. borrowings under the term loan agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including payment of a portion of the dividends to be paid by brighthouse financial, inc. to metlife, inc. in connection with the separation. the term loan agreement provides that borrowings may be made during the period prior to the separation. there were no outstanding borrowings as of december 31, 2016. in december 2016, brighthouse financial, inc. also entered into a $2.0 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a bank syndicate. borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including payment of a portion of the dividends to be paid by brighthouse financial, inc. to metlife, inc. in connection with the separation (the three-year and the five-year brighthouse credit facilities, collectively, the "brighthouse credit facilities"). the brighthouse credit facilities contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants, including requirements by brighthouse financial, inc. to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth and to maintain a maximum ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization, and limitations on the dollar amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by brighthouse financial, inc., which could restrict brighthouse financial, inc. operations and use of funds.
see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these facilities, including the circumstances under which brighthouse may draw upon such facilities in connection with and after the separation.
we have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under these facilities. as commitments associated with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements.

liquidity and capital uses in addition to the general description of liquidity and capital uses in "- summary of the company's primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital" and "- contractual obligations," the following additional information is provided regarding our primary uses of liquidity and capital:
preferred stock repurchase in june 2015, metlife, inc. repurchased and canceled all of its series b preferred stock for $1.5 billion in a series of related transactions as described in note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
common stock repurchases as described in note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of metlife, inc. common stock. pursuant to such repurchase authorizations, during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, metlife, inc. repurchased 6,948,739 shares, 39,491,991 shares and 18,876,363 shares of common stock in the open market for $372 million, $1.9 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.
at december 31, 2016, metlife, inc. had $2.7 billion remaining under the november 2016 common stock repurchase authorization. under these authorizations, metlife, inc. may purchase its common stock from the metlife policyholder trust, in the open market (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of rule 10b5-1 under the exchange act) and in privately negotiated transactions. in 2017, through february 23, 2017, metlife, inc. repurchased 8,718,054 shares of its common stock in the open market for $468 million.
common stock repurchases are dependent upon several factors, including our capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of metlife, inc.'s common stock compared to management's assessment of the stock's underlying value and applicable regulatory approvals, as well as other legal and accounting factors. see "business - regulation - u.s. regulation - potential regulation as a non-bank sifi," "business - regulation - international regulation - global systemically important insurers," "risk factors - capital-related risks - legal and regulatory restrictions and uncertainty and restrictions under the terms of certain of our securities may prevent us from repurchasing our stock and paying dividends at the level we wish." and note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
dividends during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, metlife, inc. paid dividends on its common stock of $1.7 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, metlife, inc. paid dividends on its preferred stock of $103 million, $116 million, and $122 million, respectively. see note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the calculation and timing of these dividend payments.
the declaration and payment of common stock dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, and will depend on metlife, inc.'s financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by metlife, inc.'s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the board. see note 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding a common stock dividend declared subsequent to december 31, 2016.

•   in may 2014, metlife, inc. redeemed $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% senior notes due in november 2033 at par.
debt repurchases we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. any such repurchases or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. whether or not to repurchase any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion.
support agreements metlife, inc. and several of its subsidiaries (each, an "obligor") are parties to various capital support commitments and guarantees with subsidiaries. under these arrangements, each obligor, with respect to the applicable entity, has agreed to cause such entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual obligations. we anticipate that in the event that these arrangements place demands upon us, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable us to meet anticipated demands. see "- metlife, inc. - liquidity and capital uses - support agreements."
insurance liabilities liabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, property & casualty, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. for annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. in the metlife holdings and brighthouse financial segments, which include individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. in the retirement and income solutions business within the u.s. segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. with regard to the retirement and income solutions business products that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, as of december 31, 2016, there were no funding agreements or other capital market products that could be put back to the company.
173
pledged collateral we pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by, counterparties in connection with our derivatives. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had received pledged cash collateral of $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. at december 31, 2016 and 2015, we had pledged cash collateral of $1.6 billion and $241 million, respectively. with respect to otc-bilateral derivatives in a net liability position that have credit contingent provisions, a one-notch downgrade in the company's credit or financial strength rating, as applicable, would have required $6 million of additional collateral be provided to our counterparties as of december 31, 2016. see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about collateral pledged to us, collateral we pledge and derivatives subject to credit contingent provisions.
we pledge collateral and have had collateral pledged to us, and may be required from time to time to pledge additional collateral or be entitled to have additional collateral pledged to us, in connection with collateral financing arrangements related to the reinsurance of closed block and ulsg liabilities. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
we pledge collateral from time to time in connection with funding agreements. see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
securities lending we participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. we obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. under our securities lending program, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of $26.8 billion and $30.2 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. of these amounts, $6.6 billion and $10.1 billion at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were on open, meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to us on the next business day requiring the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. the estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at december 31, 2016 was $6.5 billion, over 99% of which were u.s. government and agency securities which, if put to us, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirements to immediately return the cash collateral. see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
litigation putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation, and claims and assessments against us, in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein and those otherwise provided for on the consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of our business, including, but not limited to, in connection with our activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor, taxpayer and, formerly, a mortgage lending bank. further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. see note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
we establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. for material matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable, no accrual is made but we disclose the nature of the contingency and an aggregate estimate of the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, when such an estimate can be made. it is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. in some of the matters referred to herein, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. although in light of these considerations, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position, based on information currently known by us, in our opinion, the outcome of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. however, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
acquisitions cash outflows for acquisitions and investments in strategic partnerships during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $0, $0 and $277 million, respectively.

insurance liabilities insurance liabilities include future policy benefits, other policy-related balances, policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation, which are all reported on the consolidated balance sheet and are more fully described in notes 1 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. the amounts presented reflect future estimated cash payments and (i) are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience and expectations of future payment patterns; and (ii) consider future premium receipts on current policies in-force. all estimated cash payments presented are undiscounted as to interest, net of estimated future premiums on in-force policies and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. payment of amounts related to policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity. because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long-term projection of the performance of the closed block, we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability, if any, presented on the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category. additionally, the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than 100 years.
the sum of the estimated cash flows of $392.0 billion exceeds the liability amounts of $216.7 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; and (ii) differences in assumptions, most significantly mortality, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.
actual cash payments may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented on the consolidated balance sheets and the estimated cash payments as presented due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments.
for the majority of our insurance operations, estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balances, as presented, are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes. these cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under gaap. see "- policyholder account balances."
policyholder account balances see notes 1 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the components of policyholder account balances. see "- insurance liabilities" regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.
amounts presented represent the estimated cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges; annuitization; mortality; future interest credited; policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. for obligations denominated in foreign currencies, cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates.

the sum of the estimated cash flows of $301.0 billion exceeds the liability amount of $210.2 billion included on the consolidated balance sheets principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.
payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions we have accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending and derivatives. as the securities lending transactions expire within the next year and the timing of the return of the derivatives collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the one year or less category in the table. we also held non-cash collateral, which is not reflected as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet of $2.3 billion at december 31, 2016.
debt amounts presented for debt include short-term debt, long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities, the total of which differs from the total of the corresponding amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheet as the amounts presented herein (i) do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments; (ii) include future interest on such obligations for the period from january 1, 2017 through maturity; and (iii) do not include $35 million at december 31, 2016 of long-term debt relating to cses - fvo as such debt does not represent our contractual obligation. future interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at december 31, 2016 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from january 1, 2017 through maturity, except with respect to junior subordinated debt which was computed using the stated rates through the scheduled redemption dates as it is our expectation that such obligations will be redeemed as scheduled. inclusion of interest payments on junior subordinated debt securities through the final maturity dates would increase the contractual obligation by $7.7 billion. pursuant to collateral financing arrangements, metlife, inc. may be required to deliver cash or pledge collateral to the respective unaffiliated financial institutions. see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
investment commitments to enhance the return on our investment portfolio, we commit to lend funds under mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments and we commit to fund partnership investments. in the table, the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration dates of the corresponding commitments. as it relates to commitments to fund partnerships and bank credit facilities, we anticipate that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years; however, as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted, such obligations are generally presented in the one year or less category. commitments to fund bridge loans are short-term obligations and, as a result, are presented in the one year or less category. see note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and "- off-balance sheet arrangements."
operating leases as a lessee, we have various operating leases, primarily for office space. contractual provisions exist that could increase or accelerate those lease obligations presented, including various leases with early buyouts and/or escalation clauses. however, the impact of any such transactions would not be material to our financial position or results of operations. see note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
other other obligations presented are principally comprised of amounts due under reinsurance agreements, payables related to securities purchased but not yet settled, securities sold short, accrued interest on debt obligations, estimated fair value of derivative obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, guaranty liabilities, and accruals and accounts payable due under contractual obligations, which are all reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. if the timing of any of these other obligations is sufficiently uncertain, the amounts are included within the one year or less category. items reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets that were excluded from the table represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations. unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest totaling $1.8 billion was excluded as the timing of payment cannot be reliably determined.
separate account liabilities are excluded as they are fully funded by cash flows from the corresponding separate account assets and are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets.
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, such amounts are excluded as these purchase obligations were not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position at december 31, 2016.

additionally, we have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate insurance regulators as required.

liquidity and capital management liquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and committed facilities. liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on metlife, inc.'s liquidity. metlife, inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. these markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of metlife, inc.'s liquidity and capital management. decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. a disruption in the financial markets could limit metlife, inc.'s access to liquidity.
metlife, inc.'s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. we view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings. see "- the company - capital - rating agencies."
see "- executive summary - consolidated company outlook" for a discussion of expected impacts to liquidity and capital resources in connection with the separation including incremental sources of liquidity and capital from subsidiary dividends that we expect to receive from brighthouse (expected to be partially funded from the issuance of debt by brighthouse) and a metlife-affiliated reinsurance subsidiary, and proceeds over time from the disposition of our retained shares of brighthouse common stock, as well as incremental uses of liquidity and capital from foregone subsidiary dividends and foregone incremental debt issuances and ongoing uses of liquidity and capital from the repayment of debt maturities.

liquid assets at december 31, 2016 and 2015, metlife, inc. and other metlife holding companies had $5.8 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, in liquid assets. of these amounts, $3.7 billion and $5.3 billion were held by metlife, inc. and $2.1 billion and $1.1 billion were held by other metlife holding companies at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities excluding, assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and collateral financing arrangements.
liquid assets held in non-u.s. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-u.s. insurance operations. such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in "- liquidity and capital sources - dividends from subsidiaries." the cumulative earnings of certain active non-u.s. operations have been reinvested indefinitely in such non-u.s. operations, as described in note 19 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. under current tax laws, should we repatriate such earnings, we may be subject to additional u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.

in addition, metlife, inc. issues loans to subsidiaries or subsidiaries issue loans to metlife, inc. accordingly, changes in metlife, inc. liquid assets include issuances of loans to subsidiaries, proceeds of loans from subsidiaries and the related repayment of principal and payment of interest on such loans. see "- liquidity and capital sources - senior notes issuances and other borrowings - maturities and issuances of affiliated long-term debt" and "- liquidity and capital uses - affiliated capital and debt transactions."

sources and uses of liquid assets from separation-related transactions we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in a number of separation-related transactions that will impact our holding companies' liquid assets. in 2016, we incurred $2.3 billion of separation-related items which reduced our holding companies' liquid assets, as well as our free cash flow. these separation-related items consisted of separation-related outflows comprised of an incremental capital contribution to metlife usa, capital contributions to brighthouse subsidiaries and separation-related costs, forgone subsidiary dividends from metlife usa and forgone incremental debt at metlife, inc., net of separation-related inflows comprised of incremental subsidiary dividends from nelico and metlife usa. however, we have increased and expect to continue to increase our holding companies' liquid assets over time as a result of (i) $291 million in cash proceeds that we received in 2016 from the u.s. retail advisor force divestiture; (ii) dividends in the range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion that we expect to receive in 2017 from brighthouse (which may be partially funded by the issuance of debt by brighthouse) and a metlife-affiliated reinsurance company prior to the separation; and (iii) proceeds from the disposition of our retained shares of brighthouse common stock that we expect to receive over time. in addition to these separation-related items, we expect to have cash commitments of between $1.0 billion and $2.0 billion over the two-year period of 2017 and 2018 relating to liability management transactions, including the repayment of certain debt maturities. following the separation, we plan to maintain a liquidity buffer of $3.0 to $4.0 billion of liquid assets at the holding companies. see "- executive summary - consolidated company outlook."

dividends from subsidiaries metlife, inc. relies, in part, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. metlife, inc.'s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. the dividend limitation for u.s. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap. the significant differences relate to the treatment of dac, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.

non-gaap and other financial disclosures in this report, the company presents certain measures of its performance that are not calculated in accordance with gaap. we believe that these non-gaap financial measures enhance the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business.
the following non-gaap financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap:
non-gaap financial measures:                                           comparable gaap financial measures:
(i)              operating revenues                                    (i)                 revenues
(ii)             operating expenses                                    (ii)                expenses
(iii)            operating earnings                                    (iii)               income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax
(iv)             operating earnings available to common shareholders   (iv)                net income (loss) available to metlife, inc.'s common shareholders
(v)              free cash flow of all holding companies               (v)                 metlife, inc.'s net cash provided by operating activities reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable historical gaap measures are included in this section and the results of operations, see "- results of operations." reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures is not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable efforts to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income.
our definitions of the various non-gaap and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies:
186
operating earnings and related measures:
•   operating earnings; and
•   operating earnings available to common shareholders.
these measures are used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. consistent with gaap guidance for segment reporting, operating earnings is also our gaap measure of segment performance. operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings are also the measures by which senior management's and many other employees' performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.
operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, both net of income tax. operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
operating revenues and operating expenses these financial measures focus on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and divested businesses and certain entities required to be consolidated under gaap. also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by metlife and are referred to as divested businesses. in addition, for the year ended december 31, 2016, operating revenues and operating expenses exclude the financial impact of converting the company's japan operations to calendar year-end reporting without retrospective application of this change to prior periods and is referred to as lag elimination. operating revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses). operating expenses also excludes goodwill impairments.
the following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating revenues:
•   universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity gmib fees ("gmib fees");
•   net investment income: (i) includes investment hedge adjustments, (ii) includes income from discontinued real estate operations, (iii) excludes post-tax operating earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, (iv) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, and (v) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are vies consolidated under gaap; and
•   other revenues are adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges.
the following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating operating expenses:
•   policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments, (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to gmibs ("gmib costs"), and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts ("market value adjustments");
•   interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and excludes amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed unit-linked investments;
•   amortization of dac and voba excludes amounts related to: (i) net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) gmib fees and gmib costs, and (iii) market value adjustments;
•   amortization of negative voba excludes amounts related to market value adjustments;
•   interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are vies consolidated under gaap; and
•   other expenses excludes costs related to: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements, and (iii) acquisition, integration and other costs.
operating earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under gaap business combination accounting guidance.
187
the tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the u.s. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from the company's effective tax rate. additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms.
return on equity, allocated equity and related measures:
•   metlife, inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding aoci other than fcta, is defined as metlife, inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding the net unrealized investment gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of aoci, net of income tax.
•   operating roe is defined as operating earnings available to common shareholders, divided by average gaap common stockholders' equity.
•   operating roe, excluding aoci other than fcta, is defined as operating earnings available to common shareholders divided by average gaap common stockholders' equity, excluding aoci other than fcta.
•   allocated equity is the portion of metlife, inc.'s common stockholders' equity that management allocates to each of its segments and sub-segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. see "- economic capital." allocated equity excludes the impact of aoci other than fcta.
the above measures represent a level of equity consistent with the view that, in the ordinary course of business, we do not plan to sell most investments for the sole purpose of realizing gains or losses. also refer to the utilization of operating earnings and other financial measures based on operating earnings mentioned above.
the following additional information is relevant to an understanding of our performance results:
•   the impact of changes in our foreign currency exchange rates is calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current period and is applied to each of the comparable periods ("constant currency basis").
•   we sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. these sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under gaap, but are used as relevant measures of business activity. further, sales statistics for our latin america, asia and emea segments are on a constant currency basis.
•   asymmetrical and non-economic accounting refers to: (i) the portion of net derivative gains (losses) on embedded derivatives attributable to the inclusion of our credit spreads in the liability valuations, (ii) hedging activity that generates net derivative gains (losses) and creates fluctuations in net income because hedge accounting cannot be achieved and the item being hedged does not a have an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings, (iii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments, and (iv) impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the re-measurement of foreign denominated unhedged funding agreements and financing transactions to the u.s. dollar and the re-measurement of certain liabilities from non-functional currencies to functional currencies.
•   the company uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non-mandatory capital actions. the company defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at metlife's holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies (including capital contributions to subsidiaries), and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. this measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions, such as common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with gaap. the free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual operating earnings available to common shareholders. a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities of metlife, inc. to free cash flow of all holding companies for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is provided below.

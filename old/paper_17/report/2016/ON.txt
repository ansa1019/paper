acquisitions and dispositions including our acquisition of fairchild (including our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and dispositions, risks that acquisitions or dispositions disrupt our current plans and operations, the risk of unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from acquisitions or dispositions and difficulties encountered from integrating and consolidating and timely filing financial information with the sec for acquired businesses and accurately predicting the future financial performance of acquired businesses), competitor actions, including the adverse impact of competitor product announcements, pricing and gross profit pressures, loss of key customers, order cancellations or reduced bookings, changes in manufacturing yields, control of costs and expenses and realization of cost savings and synergies from restructurings, significant litigation, risks associated with decisions to expend cash reserves for various uses in accordance with our capital allocation policy such as debt prepayment, stock repurchases, or acquisitions rather than to retain such cash for future needs, risks associated with our substantial leverage and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements that may be in place from time to time, risks associated with our worldwide operations including foreign employment and labor matters associated with unions and collective bargaining arrangements as well as man-made and/or natural disasters affecting our operations and finances/financials, the threat or occurrence of international armed conflict and terrorist activities both in the united states and internationally, risks and costs associated with increased and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards, risks related to new legal requirements and risks involving environmental or other governmental regulation. additional factors that could affect our future results or events are described from time to time in our sec reports. readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. we assume no obligation to update such information, except as may be required by law.
you should carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this form 10-k and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the sec before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. if any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected, the trading prices of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.
trends, risks and uncertainties related to our business the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and significant downturns or upturns in customer demand can materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and, as a result, is subject to significant downturns and upturns in customer demand for semiconductors and related products. we cannot accurately predict the timing of future downturns and upturns in the semiconductor industry and how severe and prolonged these conditions might be. significant downturns often occur in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles (for semiconductors and for the end-user products in which they are used) or declines in general economic conditions and can result in reduced product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results as a result of increased operating expenses outpacing decreased revenue, reduced margins, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and/or asset impairment charges. on the other hand, significant upturns can cause us to be unable to satisfy demand in a timely and cost efficient manner. in the event of such an upturn, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, or locate suitable third-party suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
23
we may fail to realize the benefits expected from the fairchild transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
although we expect significant benefits to result from the fairchild transaction, there can be no assurance that we will actually realize these or any other anticipated benefits of the fairchild transaction, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by our ability to achieve such benefits. achieving the benefits of the fairchild transaction depends, in part, on our ability to integrate fairchilds business successfully and efficiently with our business.
the challenges involved in this integration, which are complex and time consuming, include the following: (1) demonstrating to our and fairchilds customers that the fairchild transaction will not adversely affect our ability to address the needs of customers; (2) coordinating and integrating research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs; (3) consolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures; (4) coordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities and the direction of product development; and (5) minimizing the diversion of management attention from other important business objectives.
if we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating fairchild, then we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the fairchild transaction, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
rapid innovation and short product life cycles in the semiconductor industry can result in price erosion of older products, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid innovation and short product life cycles, which often results in price erosion, especially with respect to products containing outdated technology. products are frequently replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and, as demand for older technology falls, the price at which such products can be sold drops, in some cases precipitously. in addition, our and our competitors excess inventory levels can accelerate general price erosion.
in order to continue to profitably supply older products, we must offset lower prices by reducing production costs, typically through improvements in process technology and production efficiencies. if we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins, we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products. moreover, we may not be able to cease production of older products, either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and, as a result, may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time. if reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for the products we sell, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
downturns or volatility in general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
in recent years, worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impact of the financial crisis, subsequent recovery and persistent economic uncertainty. we believe that the state of economic conditions in the united states is particularly uncertain due to likely shifts in legislative and regulatory conditions concerning, among other matters, international trade and taxation, and that an uneven recovery or a renewed global downturn may put pressure on our sales due to reductions in customer demand as well as customers deferring purchases. volatile and/or uncertain economic conditions can adversely impact sales and profitability and make it difficult
24
for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. to the extent we incorrectly plan for favorable economic conditions that do not materialize or take longer to materialize than expected, we may face oversupply of our products relative to customer demand. in the past, reduced customer spending has driven us, and may in the future drive us and our competitors, to reduce product pricing, which results in a negative effect on gross profit. moreover, volatility in revenues as a result of unpredictable economic conditions may alter our anticipated working capital needs and interfere with our short-term and long-term strategies. to the extent that our sales, profitability and strategies are negatively affected by downturns or volatility in general economic conditions, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
if we do not have access to capital on favorable terms, on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
we require a substantial amount of capital to meet our operating requirements and remain competitive. we routinely incur significant costs to implement new manufacturing and information technologies, to increase our productivity and efficiency, to upgrade equipment and to expand production capacity and there can be no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended. we have incurred and may continue to incur material amounts of debt to fund these requirements. significant volatility or disruption in the global financial markets may result in us not being able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, and we may not be able to refinance, if necessary, any outstanding debt when due, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. any inability to obtain additional funding on favorable terms, on the timeline we anticipate, or at all, may cause us to curtail our operations significantly, reduce planned capital expenditures and research and development, or obtain funds through arrangements that management does not currently anticipate, including disposing of our assets and relinquishing rights to certain technologies, the occurrence of any of which may significantly impair our ability to remain competitive. if our operating results falter, our cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we may be unable to successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
we have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions and alliances that involve significant risks and uncertainties. successful acquisitions and alliances in the semiconductor industry are difficult to accomplish because they require, among other things, efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts, often in markets or regions in which we have limited experience. our decision to pursue an acquisition is based on, among other factors, our estimates of expected future earnings growth and potential cost savings. for example, we may anticipate tax savings through integration of a newly acquired business into our business and rationalization of a combined infrastructure, and our estimates could turn out to be incorrect. risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include, but are not limited to: (1) the ability to integrate information technology and other systems; (2) unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence; (3) customers responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company; (4) diversion of managements attention from our day to day operations; and (5) loss of key employees due to uncertainty about positions post-integration. in addition, we may incur unexpected costs, such as operating or restructuring costs (including severance payments to departing employees). in the past, we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to certain of our acquisitions as a result of such factors as significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results. missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions, which could
25
be caused by factors outside of our control, or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate or at all, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
depending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business, we may be required by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) and sec rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements. the acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or such statements may not be prepared in accordance with gaap or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems, any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis. any revisions to, inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations.
we may be unable to maintain manufacturing efficiency, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we believe that our success materially depends on our ability to maintain or improve our current margin levels related to our manufacturing. semiconductor manufacturing requires advanced equipment and significant capital investment, leading to high fixed costs which include depreciation expense. manufacturing semiconductor components also involves highly complex processes that we and our competitors are continuously modifying to improve yields and product performance. in addition, impurities, waste or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower production yields. our manufacturing efficiency is and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency, increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors, or be successful in our manufacturing rationalization plans. if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and testing facilities at expected levels, or if production capacity increases while revenues do not, the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
many of our facilities and processes are interdependent and an operational disruption at any particular facility could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce many of our products, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we utilize an integrated manufacturing platform in which multiple facilities may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product. as a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at a facility toward the front-end of our manufacturing process may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products. for example, our facility in roznov, czech republic, manufactures silicon wafers used by a number of our facilities, and any operational disruption, natural or man-made disaster or other extraordinary event that impacted the roznov facility would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce a number of our products worldwide. in the event of a disruption at any such facility, we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties, in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed. conversely, many of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our end-products, and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product. in the event of any such operational disruption, we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities (for example, due to construction delays) or transferring production to other existing facilities (for example, due to capacity
26
constraints or difficulty in transitioning to new manufacturing processes), any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
the failure to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives, including through restructuring activities, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
from time to time, we have implemented cost reduction initiatives in response to significant downturns in our industry, including relocating manufacturing to lower cost regions, transitioning higher-cost external supply to internal manufacturing, working with our material suppliers to lower costs, implementing personnel reductions and voluntary retirement programs, reducing employee compensation, temporary shutdowns of facilities with mandatory vacation and aggressively streamlining our overhead. in the past, we have recorded net restructuring charges to cover costs associated with our cost reduction initiatives. these costs have been primarily composed of employee separation costs (including severance payments) and asset impairments. we also often undertake restructuring activities and programs to improve our cost structure in connection with our business acquisitions, which can result in significant charges, including charges for severance payments to terminated employees and asset impairment charges.
we cannot assure you that our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented, or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability. because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business, the associated cost reductions could materially adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated. even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business, including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position. to the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other benefits of our cost reduction and restructuring initiatives that we anticipate, our results of operations may be materially adversely effected.
if we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments required to remain competitive in our business, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products. the development of new products is a complex and time-consuming process and often requires significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing. we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required to remain competitive. in addition, the lengthy development cycle for our products limits our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and end-users. there can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes, known as design wins, for new products. in addition, design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or that we will generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments, as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. there is no assurance that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop new products, that a significant investment in new products will be profitable or that we will have margins as high as we anticipate at the time of investment or have experienced historically. to the extent that we underinvest in our research and development efforts, or that our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products, we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products that are attractive to our customers, and as a result our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
27
we may be unable to develop new products to satisfy, or we may develop products that misalign with, changing customer demands, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, together with frequent new product introductions. our success is largely dependent on our ability to accurately predict, identify and adapt to changes affecting the requirements of our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner. we focus our independent new product development efforts on market segments and applications that we anticipate will experience growth, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying high-growth areas. a fundamental shift in technologies or consumption patterns and preferences in our existing product markets or the product markets of our customers or end-users could make our current products obsolete and could make new products that we planned to introduce no longer relevant to our customers needs. if our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers, including due to circumstances outside of our control like a fundamental shift in the product markets of our customers and end users, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
uncertainties regarding the timing and amount of customer orders could lead to excess inventory and write-downs of inventory that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders or customer agreements, and we generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers requiring a commitment to purchase. generally, our customers may cancel orders 30 days prior to shipment for standard products and 90 days for custom products without incurring a significant penalty. we routinely generate inventory based on customers estimates of end-user demand for their products, which is difficult to predict. this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties, which may vary significantly. in addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. furthermore, short customer lead times are standard in the industry due to overcapacity. the cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction of products due to the failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory or the incurrence of significant cancellation penalties under our arrangements with our raw materials and equipment suppliers. unsold inventory, cancelled orders and cancellation penalties may materially adversely affect our results of operations, and inventory write-downs may materially adversely affect our financial condition.
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control. we face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. because our components are often building block semiconductors that, in some cases, are integrated into more complex ics, we also face competition from manufacturers of ics, asics and fully customized ics, as well as from customers who develop their own ic products. in addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future.
our inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. products or technologies developed by competitors that are larger and have more substantial research and development budgets, or that are smaller and more targeted in their development efforts, may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. we also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are
28
not competitive on the basis of price, quality, technical performance, features, system compatibility, customized design, innovation, availability, delivery timing and reliability. if we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support, our sales and revenues may be materially adversely affected. competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices, and any inability to maintain revenues or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin. reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid consolidation and our inability to compete with large competitors or failure to identify attractive opportunities to consolidate may materially adversely affect our business.
the semiconductor industry is characterized by the high costs associated with developing marketable products and manufacturing technologies as well as high levels of investment in production capabilities. as a result, the semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us, including, but not limited to: substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products; longer independent operating histories; presence in key markets; patent protection; and greater name recognition. in addition, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to our peers if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to consolidate with larger or smaller companies to expand our business. consolidation among our competitors and integration among our customers could erode our market share, negatively impact our capacity to compete and require us to restructure our operations, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
natural disasters and other business disruptions could cause significant harm to our business operations and facilities and could adversely affect our supply chain and our customer base, any of which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.
our u.s. and international manufacturing facilities and distribution centers, as well as the operations of our third-party suppliers, are susceptible to losses and interruptions caused by floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, typhoons, and similar natural disasters, as well as power outages, telecommunications failures, industrial accidents, and similar events. the occurrence of natural disasters in any of the regions in which we operate could severely disrupt the operations of our businesses by negatively impacting our supply chain, our ability to deliver products, and the cost of our products. such events can negatively impact revenues and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow, both from decreased revenue and from increased costs associated with the event. in addition, these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility to the u.s. and worldwide economies. although we carry insurance to generally compensate for losses of the type noted above, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses that may be incurred or continue to be available in the affected area at commercially reasonable rates and terms. to the extent any losses from natural disasters or other business disruptions are not covered by insurance, any costs, write-downs, impairments and decreased revenues can materially adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition.
the loss of one of our largest customers, or a significant reduction in the revenue we generate from these customers, could materially adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and results of operations.
product sales to our ten largest customers have historically accounted for a significant amount of our business. for instance, for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, revenue from our 10 largest end customers
29
collectively represented approximately 24% and 22%, respectively, of our total revenues for those years. many of our customers operate in cyclical industries, and, in the past, we have experienced significant fluctuations from period to period in the volume of our products ordered. generally, our agreements with our customers impose no minimum or continuing obligations to purchase our products. we cannot assure you that our largest customers will not cease purchasing products from us in favor of products produced by other suppliers, significantly reduce orders or seek price reductions in the future, and any such event could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, and results of operations.
because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive and communications industries, a downturn or lower sales to customers in either industry could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
a significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive and communications industries (including networking). sales into these industries represented approximately 34% and 19% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended december 31, 2016, and those percentages will vary from quarter to quarter. both the automotive and communications industries are cyclical, and, as a result, our customers in these industries are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, disruptive innovation and end-market preferences, which can adversely affect sales of our products and, correspondingly, our results of operations. additionally, the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in these industries could decline despite continued growth in their respective end markets. lower sales to customers in the automotive or communications industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
shortages or increased prices of raw materials could materially adversely affect our results of operations.
our manufacturing processes rely on many raw materials, including various chemicals and gases, polysilicon, silicon wafers, aluminum, gold, silver, copper, lead frames, mold compound and ceramic packages. generally, our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations, and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources on a just-in-time basis. from time to time, suppliers of raw materials may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors beyond our control. shortages could occur in various essential raw materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand. if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner, the costs of our raw materials increases significantly, their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
we are dependent on the services of third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers, and any disruption in or deterioration of the quality of the services delivered by such third parties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
we use third-party contractors for certain of our manufacturing activities, primarily wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of final goods. our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs, which may be inaccurate, and, in some cases, require longer-term commitments. we are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized third-party suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies. arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be time consuming and costly, and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited. our business operations, productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated, the cost of such services increased significantly, the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect.
30
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
a significant amount of our total revenue outside of the u.s. is derived from the asia/pacific region and europe, and we maintain significant operations in these regions. in addition, we rely on a number of contract manufacturers whose operations are primarily located in the asia/pacific region. risks inherent in doing business on an international level include, among others, the following:
   economic and geopolitical instability (including as a result of the threat or occurrence of armed international conflict or terrorist attacks);

   changes in regulatory requirements, international trade agreements, tariffs, customs, duties and other trade barriers;

   licensing requirements for the import or export of certain products;

                                                                        exposure to different legal standards, customs, business practices, tariffs, duties and other trade barriers, including changes with respect to price protection, competition practices, ip, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics, import and export license requirements and restrictions, and accounts receivable collections;

   transportation and other supply chain delays and disruptions;

   power supply shortages and shutdowns;

   fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;

   difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including collective bargaining agreements and workers councils, exposure to foreign labor laws and other employment and labor issues;

   currency fluctuations;

   currency convertibility and repatriation;

   taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel;

   limitations on the repatriation of earnings and potential taxation of foreign profits in the u.s.;

   potential violations by our international employees or third party agents of international or u.s. laws relevant to foreign operations (e.g., the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa));

   difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights; and

   other risks relating to the administration of or changes in, or new interpretations of, the laws, regulations and policies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.

we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming the risks that relate to or arise from operating in international markets, the materialization of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we could be subject to changes in tax rates or the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation or have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
changes to income tax regulations in the united states and the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could, under our existing tax structure, significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. in addition, other factors or events, including business combinations and investment transactions, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns or as a result of deficiencies asserted by taxing authorities, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in available tax credits, increasing operations in high tax jurisdictions, and changes in tax rates, could also increase our future effective tax rate.
31
our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire. the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd). the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. these changes, if adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in the united states, a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies, but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time.
the distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the united states may be subject to united states income taxes, thus reducing our net income and materially adversely affecting our results of operations.
we hold a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements, debt repurchases and repayments, acquisitions, and stock repurchases. if we are unable to address our u.s. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current debt agreements or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations.
we operate a global business through numerous foreign subsidiaries, and there is a risk that tax authorities will challenge our transfer pricing methodologies and/or legal entity structures, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
we conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are, therefore, subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between related parties be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arms length transaction between unrelated parties. there is uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. to the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties. the ultimate outcome of a tax examination could differ materially from our provisions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results or operations and cash flows.
our legal organizational structure could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. changes in tax laws, regulations, future jurisdictional profitability of us and our subsidiaries, and related regulatory interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, any challenges to how our entities are structured or realigned or their business purpose by taxing authorities could result in us becoming subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
32
currency fluctuations, changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we have sizeable sales and operations in the asia/pacific region and europe and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than u.s. dollars. in addition, while a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside the u.s., many of our liabilities, including our outstanding indebtedness, and certain other cash payments, such as share repurchases, are payable in u.s. dollars. as a result, currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.
in addition, repatriation of funds held outside the u.s. could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations. from time to time, we are required to make cash deposits outside of the u.s. to support bank guarantees of our obligations under certain office leases or amounts we owe to certain vendors and such cash deposits are not available for other uses as long as the related bank guarantees are outstanding. foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency. as a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the u.s., our financial flexibility may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations. restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the u.s. may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.
we may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel.
our success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel, both in the u.s. and internationally. in the semiconductor industry, the competition for qualified personnel, particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees, is intense, particularly when the business cycle is improving. during such periods, competitors may try to recruit our most valuable technical employees. while we devote a great deal of our attention to designing competitive compensation programs aimed at accomplishing this goal, specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require. loss of the services of, or failure to effectively recruit, qualified personnel, including senior managers, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business.
if we must reduce our use of equity awards to compensate our employees, our competitiveness in the employee marketplace could be adversely affected and our results of operations could vary as a result of changes in our stock-based compensation programs.
we have in the past and expect to continue to issue rsus with time-based vesting, performance-based awards and common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of the grant and that are subject to vesting over time as compensation tools. while this is a routine practice in many parts of the world, foreign exchange and income tax regulations in some countries make this practice more and more difficult. such regulations tend to diminish the value of equity compensation to our employees in those countries. our current practice is to seek stockholder approval of new, or amendments to existing, equity compensation plans. if these proposals do not receive stockholder approval, we may not be able to grant equity awards to employees at the same levels as in the past, which could materially adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, thereby materially adversely affecting our business. in addition, changes in forecasted stock-based compensation expense could cause our results of operations to vary by impacting our gross margin percentage, research and development expenses, marketing, general and administrative expenses and our tax rate.
33
disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could materially harm our business and reputation.
currently, certain of our u.s. employees in pennsylvania are represented by labor unions. in addition, we may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our non-union facilities. disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to production slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers, which could result in a loss of business and material damage to our reputation. in addition, union activity and compliance with international labor standards could result in higher labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property we use, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
the enforceability of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, software licenses and other ip is uncertain in certain circumstances. effective ip protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in the u.s. and internationally. the various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered ip assets, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts. with respect to our ip generally, we cannot assure you that:
   any of the substantial number of u.s. or foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others;

   any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;

   any of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how or mask works that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others; or

   any of our pending or future trademark, copyright, or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought.

when we seek to enforce our rights, we are often subject to claims that the ip right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim. in addition, our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged ip rights of its own against us, which may materially adversely impact our business. an unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products, which could in turn negatively affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.
in addition, some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications. we seek to protect our proprietary technologies, including technologies that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to ip arising out of our research. should we be unable to protect our ip, competitors may develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies, benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
34
if our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the ip rights of third parties, efforts to address such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing third-party ip rights. if necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under such ip rights. however, we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. the failure to obtain a license from a third party for ip we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies. further, we may be subject to ip litigation, which could cause us to incur significant expense, materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. in the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation, we may be required to:
   pay substantial damages;

   indemnify customers or distributors;

   cease the manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products;

   expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies;

   discontinue the use of processes; or

   obtain licenses, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to the infringing technologies.

the outcome of ip litigation is inherently uncertain and, if not resolved in our favor, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
environmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our manufacturing operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the management, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air, water and ground, and we have been identified as either a primary responsible party or a potentially responsible party at sites where we or our predecessors operated or disposed of waste in the past. our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other requirements, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. we have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites, and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances. however, we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs. in addition, the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including:
   changes in u.s. and international environmental or health and safety laws or regulations;

   the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted;

   our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities;

                 the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims, including the cost of clean-up of currently unknown environmental conditions; or

   the cost of fines, penalties or other legal liability, should we fail to comply with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations.

35
to the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance, we may bear the full effect of such costs, expense and liabilities which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards.
like most publicly traded companies, we incur significant cost and spend a significant amount of management time and internal resources to comply with changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, which requires managements annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm. as we continue to make strategic acquisitions, mergers and alliances, the integration of these businesses increases the complexity of our systems of controls. while we devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements under section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 (sox), we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial process and reporting in the future.
there can be no assurance that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the combined companys internal control over financial reporting in the future. failure to comply with sox, including delaying or failing to successfully integrate our acquisitions into our internal control over financial reporting or the identification and reporting of a material weakness, may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements or even in our ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of such transactions, and the trading price of our common stock or other securities may decline. in addition, if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our investors and others may lose confidence in our financial statements, our financial statements may be materially inaccurate, our access to capital markets may be restricted and the trading price of our common stock may decline.
warranty claims, product liability claims and product recalls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
manufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled, clean environment. minute impurities in our manufacturing materials, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, manufacturing equipment failures, and other defects can cause our products to be non-compliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional. we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). in addition, if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in their recall. as suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design, oems are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage, if any, and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
36
since a defect or failure in our product could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them (and consequential claims for damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the products involved. in certain instances, we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions of sale and other customer contracts. there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective, and to the extent that we are liable for damages in excess of the revenues and profits we received from the products involved, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network that could irreparably damage our reputation and our business, expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations.
we routinely collect and store sensitive data, including ip and other proprietary information about our business and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners. the secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. we may be subject to disruptions or breaches of our secured network caused by computer viruses, illegal hacking, criminal fraud or impersonation, acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error. our security measures and/or those of our third party service providers and/or customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches. the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber security breaches and vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. any such compromise of our information security could result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business, an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets, the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws. in addition, to the extent we sell products containing bugs or viruses to our customers, we may be exposed to liability from the end-users of such products. any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
sales through distributors and other third parties expose us to risks that, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we face risks related to our sale of a significant, and increasing, portion of our products through distributors. distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. violations of the fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. failure to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
trends, risks and uncertainties relating to our indebtedness our substantial debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $3,806.8 million of outstanding indebtedness. we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt, to make acquisitions or for other purposes, and if we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify. the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors, including:
   our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired;

37
   the timing, amount and execution of our capital allocation policy, including our share repurchase program, could be affected by the degree to which we are leveraged;

                                   a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt, which reduces the funds available to us for our operations and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests;

   some of our debt is and will continue to be at variable rates of interest, which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates;

                                our debt agreements may contain, and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain, financial and restrictive covenants, and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us;

   our level of indebtedness will increase our vulnerability to, and reduce our flexibility to respond to, general economic downturns and adverse industry and business conditions;

   as our long-term debt ages, we may need to renegotiate or repay such debt or seek additional financing;

   to the extent the debt we incur requires collateral to secure such indebtedness, our assets could be at risk and our flexibility related to such assets could be limited;

   our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the semiconductor industry;

   our substantial leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis our competitors who may have less leverage relative to their overall capital structures; and

   our level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors.

to the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
indebtedness incurred in connection with the fairchild transaction could materially and adversely affect us by, among other things, limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.
in connection with our acquisition of fairchild, we entered into the amended credit agreement providing for the $600 million revolving credit facility, which provides liquidity to us, and the $2.4 billion term loan b facility, which was used to fund the acquisition of fairchild. the obligations under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the personal property and material real property assets of the company and most of the companys domestic subsidiaries. as a result, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the amended credit agreement, the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness, in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. in addition, subject to customary exceptions, the amended credit agreement requires mandatory prepayment under certain circumstances, which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and the term loan b facility rather than using funds for other business purposes. our acquisition-related financing could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including, among other things, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.
38
the agreements relating to our indebtedness, including the amended credit agreement, may restrict our ability to operate our business, and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations.
our debt agreements, including the amended credit agreement, contain, and any future debt agreements may include, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to:
   incur additional debt, including guarantees;

   incur liens;

   make certain investments;

   sell or otherwise dispose of assets;

   make some acquisitions;

   engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other change in control transactions;

   make distributions to our stockholders;

   engage in restructuring activities;

   engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions; and

   issue or repurchase stock or other securities.

such agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements, including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests. our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them. to the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected. these restrictions may limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us. to the extent that we are unable to engage in activities that support the growth, profitability and competitiveness of our business, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, and any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from sales of assets in the ordinary course of business to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling additional assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. we cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. furthermore, we cannot assure you that, if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event, our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities. if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness, which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. a default under our committed credit facilities, including our amended credit agreement, could also limit our ability to make further borrowings under those facilities, which could materially adversely affect our business and results and operations. in addition, to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations, we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock, which would have a dilutive effect to the current stockholders.
39
an event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately, which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness. any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable. we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default, and, as described above, any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if our operating subsidiaries, which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt, are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. in the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and, as described above, any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
borrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time, including under our amended credit agreement, are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk. if interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. during the first quarter of 2017, we entered into interest rate swaps that involved the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for a portion of our term loan b facility. however, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. to the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated, the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
servicing the 1.00% notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 1.00% notes in a timely manner.
in june 2015, we issued $690.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.00% notes. holders of the 1.00% notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined under the indenture governing the 1.00% notes) at a repurchase price equal to
40
100% of the principal amount of the 1.00% notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. in addition, upon conversion of the 1.00% notes to be repurchased, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 1.00% notes being converted. moreover, we will be required to repay the 1.00% notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. servicing the 1.00% notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 1.00% notes. our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 1.00% notes, repurchase the 1.00% notes in the event of a fundamental change or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. if we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the 1.00% notes, we would be required to issue significant amounts of our common stock, which would dilute existing stockholders. in addition, if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the 1.00% notes following a fundamental change, we would be in default under the terms of the 1.00% notes, which could cross default other debt and materially, adversely harm our business. the terms of the amended credit agreement limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur, but the terms of the 1.00% notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur. if we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above. our decision to use our cash for other purposes, such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock, could also intensify these risks.
the conditional conversion feature of the 1.00% notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and, if we elect to settle the 1.00% notes conversion in common stock, could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders.
prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding september 1, 2020, holders of the 1.00% notes may convert the 1.00% notes only if specified conditions are met. in the event the conditional conversion feature of the 1.00% notes is triggered, holders of the 1.00% notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. if one or more holders elect to convert their 1.00% notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity. in addition, if the conditional conversion feature of the 1.00% notes is triggered, even if holders do not elect to convert their 1.00% notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 1.00% notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. any material decrease in our liquidity or reduction in our net working capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, if we elect to settle the 1.00% notes conversion in common stock, such issuance of common stock could materially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders, including stockholders who previously converted their 1.00% notes.
the fundamental change repurchase feature of our 1.00% notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.
the terms of our 1.00% notes require us to repurchase the 1.00% notes in the event of a fundamental change (as defined under the indenture governing the 1.00% notes). in certain circumstances, a takeover of our company could trigger an option of the holders of the 1.00% notes to require us to repurchase the 1.00% notes. this may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors in the 1.00% notes, which could materially decrease the value of the 1.00% notes.
41
note hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.
concurrently with the issuance of the 1.00% notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions, which we refer to as the option counterparties. the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the 1.00% notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 1.00% notes, as the case may be. we also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. however, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds $25.96.
in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of the 1.00% notes. the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 1.00% notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 1.00% notes or following any repurchase of the 1.00% notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). the potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.
counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions, if realized, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
the option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions. we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties. our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. if one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions.
to the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions, we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 1.00% notes and/or cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 1.00% notes, as the case may be. our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. in addition, upon a default by one of the option counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock. any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
trends, risks and uncertainties relating to our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability, and unexpected changes may impact the value of our common stock. a large portion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. thus, small
42
declines in revenues could negatively affect our operating results in any given quarter. in addition to the other factors described above, factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include:
   the timing and size of orders from our customers, including cancellations and reschedulings;

   the timing of introduction of new products;

   the gain or loss of significant customers, including as a result of industry consolidation or as a result of our acquisitions;

   seasonality in some of our target markets;

   changes in the mix of products we sell;

   changes in demand by the end-users of our customers products;

   market acceptance of our current and future products;

   variability of our customers product life cycles;

   availability of supplies and manufacturing services;

   changes in manufacturing yields or other factors affecting the cost of goods sold, such as the cost and availability of raw materials and the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity;

   changes in the prices of our products, which can be affected by the level of our customers and end-users demand, technological change, product obsolescence, competition or other factors;

   cancellations, changes or delays of deliveries to us by our third-party manufacturers, including as a result of the availability of manufacturing capacity and the proposed terms of manufacturing arrangements;

   our liquidity and access to capital; and

   our research and development activities and the funding thereof.

an adverse change or development in any of the above factors could cause the market price of common stock to materially decline.
the market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.
the stock markets in general, and the markets for high technology stocks in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.
the market price of the common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, among others, some of which are beyond our control:
   variations in our quarterly operating results;

   the issuance or repurchase of shares of our common stock;

   changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance;

   changes in market valuations of similar companies;

   announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new products or product enhancements;

   loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions; and

   additions or departures of key personnel.

the trading price of our common stock in the past has had significant variance and we cannot accurately predict every potential risk that may materially and adversely affect our stock price.
43
provisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of our company, which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.
our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. these provisions:
   establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting;

                                         authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock, which is preferred stock that our board of directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval and that could be issued with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt; and

   require the approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding common stock to amend any of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or by-laws.

although we believe these provisions make a higher third-party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. any delay or prevention of an acquisition of our company that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock.

(2)                                                                         our sam comprises the following specific wsts product categories: (a) discrete products (all discrete semiconductors other than sensors, microwave power transistors/modules, microwave diodes, and microwave transistors, power modules, logic and optoelectronics); (b) standard analog products (amplifiers, vregs and references, comparators, assp consumer, assp communications, assp computer, assp automotive and assp industrial and others); (c) standard logic products (general purpose logic); (d) standard product logic (consumer other, computer other peripherals, wired / wireless communications, automotive, industrial and multipurpose); (e) cmos and ccd image sensors; (f) memory; (g) microcontrollers and (h) motor control modules. our sam is derived using the most recent information available, excluding foundry exposure, at the time of the filing of each respective periods annual report and is revised in subsequent periods to reflect final results.

as indicated above, worldwide semiconductor sales increased from $291.6 billion in 2012 to $338.9 billion in 2016. the increase of 1.1% from 2015 to 2016 reflected improving macroeconomic conditions in the second half of 2016. sales in our sam increased from $103.7 billion in 2012 to $118.9 billion in 2016. the increase of 2.6% from 2015 to 2016 is consistent with the trend in the worldwide semiconductor market. the most recently published estimates of wsts project a compound annual growth rate in our sam of approximately 4.0% for the next three years. these projections are not ours and may not be indicative of actual results.
historically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical. during a down cycle, unit demand and pricing have tended to fall in tandem, resulting in revenue declines. in response to such declines, manufacturers have
48
reduced or shut down production capacity. when new applications or other factors have caused demand to strengthen, production volumes have historically stabilized and then grown again. as market unit demand reaches levels above capacity production capabilities, shortages begin to occur, which typically causes pricing power to swing back from customers to manufacturers, thus prompting further capacity expansion. such expansion has typically resulted in overcapacity following a decrease in demand, which has triggered another similar cycle.
on semiconductor overview we are driving innovation in energy efficient electronics. our extensive portfolio of sensors, power management, connectivity, custom and soc, analog, logic, timing, and discrete devices helps customers efficiently solve their design challenges in advanced electronic systems and products. our power management and motor driver semiconductor components control, convert, protect and monitor the supply of power to the different elements within a wide variety of electronic devices. our custom asics use analog, mcu, dsp, mixed-signal and advanced logic capabilities to act as the brain behind many of our automotive, medical, aerospace/defense, consumer and industrial customers products. our signal management semiconductor components provide high-performance clock management and data flow management for precision computing, communications and industrial systems. our growing portfolio of sensors, including image sensors, optical image stabilization and auto focus devices provide advanced solutions for automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications. our standard semiconductor components serve as building blocks within virtually all types of electronic devices. these various products fall into the logic, analog, discrete, image sensors, iot and memory categories used by the wsts group.
our new product development efforts continue to be focused on building solutions in product areas that appeal to customers in focused market segments and across multiple high growth applications. we collaborate with our customers to identify desired innovations in electronic systems in each end-market that we serve. this enables us to participate in the fastest growing sectors of the market. we also innovate in advanced packaging technologies to support ongoing size reduction in electronic systems and in advanced thermal packaging to support high performance power conversion applications. it is our practice to regularly re-evaluate our research and development spending, to assess the deployment of resources and to review the funding of high growth technologies. we deploy people and capital with the goal of maximizing our investment in research and development in order to facilitate continued growth by targeting innovative products and solutions for high growth applications that position us to outperform the industry. our design expertise in analog, digital, mixed signal and imaging ics, combined with our extensive portfolio of standard products enable the company to offer comprehensive, value added solutions to our global customers for their electronics systems.
we believe that some of the key factors and trends affecting our results of operations include, but not limited to:
   our acquisition of fairchild and our integration of fairchilds business into our operations, including through the segment realignment described below;

   macroeconomic conditions affecting the semiconductor industry;

   the cyclicality and seasonality of the semiconductor industry;

   the global economic climate;

   our significant indebtedness, including the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisition of fairchild;

   an uncertain corporate tax environment, both in the u.s. and abroad;

   an uncertain political climate and related impacts on global trade;

   the effects of trends in the automotive industry on our revenues; and

49
   competitive conditions, and in particular consolidation, within our industry.

fairchild acquisition on september 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of fairchild, pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger (the fairchild agreement) with each of fairchild and falcon operations sub, inc., a delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary, which provided for the acquisition of fairchild by us (the fairchild transaction). the purchase price totaled $2,532.2 million and was funded by the borrowings against our term loan b facility and a partial draw of our revolving credit facility and with cash on hand.
we believe that this acquisition creates a power semiconductor leader with strong capabilities in a rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry. ultimately, we believe that the combination of fairchild operations with our own will provide complementary product lines to offer customers the full spectrum of high, medium and low voltage products, and we will continue to pioneer technology and design innovation in efficient energy consumption to help our customers achieve success and drive value for our partners and employees around the world. we believe the acquisition also expands our footprint in wireless communication products, particularly in high efficiency power conversions and usb type c communication and power delivery. see business - 2016 acquisition activity, risk factors and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information. see note 4: acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
recent on semiconductor results our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 were $3,906.9 million, an increase of approximately 11.8% from $3,495.8 million from the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was attributable to the acquisition of fairchild, partially offset by lower revenues in our image sensor group. during 2016, we reported net income attributable to on semiconductor of $182.1 million compared to $206.2 million in 2015. our gross margin decreased by approximately 90 basis points to 33.2% in 2016 from 34.1% in 2015. the decrease was due to the expensing of the fair market value of inventory step-up from the fairchild acquisition of $67.5 million. excluding the expensing of the fair market value of inventory step-up, the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by higher factory utilization and product mix.
on semiconductor q1 2017 outlook based upon product booking trends, backlog levels, and estimated turns levels, we estimate that our revenues will be approximately $1,215 to $1,265 million in the first quarter of 2017. backlog levels for the first quarter of 2017 represent approximately 80% to 85% of our anticipated first quarter 2017 revenues. for the first quarter of 2017, we estimate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be approximately 33.4% to 34.8%.
statements related to our outlook for the first quarter of 2017 are based on our current expectations, forecasts, estimates and assumptions. such statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. see risk factors for additional information.
business and macroeconomic environment influence on cost savings and restructuring activities in 2016 and 2017, our initiatives have been and will be focused on synergy related cost reductions from the fairchild acquisition. additionally, we have historically pursued, and expect to continue to pursue, other cost
50
saving initiatives to align our overall cost structure, capital investments and other expenditures with our expected revenue, spending and capacity levels based on our current sales and manufacturing projections. we have recognized efficiencies from previously implemented restructuring activities and programs and continue to implement profitability enhancement programs to improve our cost structure. however, the semiconductor industry has traditionally been highly cyclical and has often experienced significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. there can be no assurances that we will adequately forecast economic conditions or that we will effectively align our cost structure, capital investments and other expenditures with our revenue, spending and capacity levels in the future.
see results of operations - restructuring, asset impairments and other, net below, along with note 6: restructuring, asset impairments and other, net in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for information relating to our most recent cost saving initiatives.
segment realignment in 2016
during the third quarter of 2016, we realigned our operating and reporting segments into the following three operating and reporting segments to optimize anticipated efficiencies resulting from our acquisition of fairchild: power solutions group, analog solutions group and image sensor group. the operating results of the system solutions group, which was previously our fourth operating and reporting segment, and which did not have goodwill, are now assigned among the three current operating and reporting segments. prior year periods of segment information presented below reflect the current three operating and reporting segments. our power solutions group and analog solutions group operating and reporting segments include the business acquired in the fairchild transaction.
results of operations our results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 include the results of operations from our acquisitions of fairchild, axsem, aptina, and truesense on september 19, 2016, july 15, 2015, august 15, 2014 and april 30, 2014, respectively.

the increase in revenues from 2015 compared to 2014 of $334.0 million, or approximately 11%, was primarily attributed to $411.0 million of additional revenue in the image sensor group provided by a full year of operations from the 2014 acquisitions of aptina and truesense, partially offset by decreased revenue from our former system solutions group segment and a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 8%.
revenues by reportable segment for each of 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollars in millions):
2016                 as a % of       2015                 as a % of       2014                 as a % of revenue (1)                          revenue (1)                          revenue (1)

revenues from the power solutions group revenues from the power solutions group increased by $298.7 million, or approximately 21%, during 2016 compared to 2015, and decreased by $13.6 million, or approximately 1%, during 2015 compared to 2014.
the 2016 increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of fairchild, which had $277.5 million in revenues across various products within this segment. revenues from our discrete products increased by $215.0 million, or approximately 35%, revenues from our new ipms and optoelectronics products increased by $45.8 million and $20.8 million, respectively, and revenues from our analog products increased by $20.5 million, or approximately 6%.
the 2015 decrease resulted from a decrease in revenues from our ipm products of $14.1 million, or approximately 13%, and a decrease in revenues from tmos products of $14.6 million, or approximately 6%, partially offset by an increase in revenues from memory products of $16.7 million, or approximately 24%.
revenues from the analog solutions group revenues from the analog solutions group increased by $142.9 million, or approximately 11%, during 2016 compared to 2015 and decreased by $77.2 million, or approximately 5%, during 2015 compared to 2014.
the 2016 increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of fairchild, which had $134.0 million in revenues across various products within this segment. additionally, revenues from our legacy analog products increased $19.9 million, or approximately 5%, partially offset by decreased revenue in our lsi products of $15.0 million, or approximately 5%.
the 2015 decrease resulted from a decrease in revenues from our lsi products of $62.0 million, or approximately 18%, and a decrease in revenues from analog products of $18.5 million, or approximately 5%.
revenues from the image sensor group revenues from the image sensor group decreased by $30.5 million, or approximately 4%, during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased by $424.8 million, or approximately 132%, during 2015 compared to 2014.
53
the 2016 decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues from our consumer products of $57.6 million, or approximately 9%, offset by an increase in revenues from our lsi products of $15.2 million, or approximately 51%, and an increase in revenues from our asic products of $11.8 million, or approximately 12%.
the 2015 increase was primarily attributable to $409.6 million of additional revenue generated by aptina and truesense during their first full year of operations after acquisition, as compared to 2014, in which the two businesses generated $262.4 million of revenue during the period of 2014 after the closing of the acquisitions.

gross profit and gross margin (exclusive of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets described below)
our gross profit by reportable segment for each of 2016, 2015, and 2014 was as follows (dollars in millions):
2016                   as a % of        2015                   as a % of        2014                     as a % of segment                                 segment                                   segment revenue (2)                             revenue (2)                               revenue (2)

54
our gross profit was $1,296.9 million, $1,193.2 million and $1,084.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the gross profit increase of $103.7 million, or approximately 9%, for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the contributions from fairchild, which generated approximately $87 million of gross profit for 2016.
the gross profit increase of $108.3 million, or approximately 10%, for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to the contributions of acquisitions during 2014, including $27.0 million for the amortization of the fair market value of inventory step-up from our acquisitions during 2014 for which there was no amortization during 2015, and manufacturing and cost improvements that were partially offset by decreased average selling prices.
gross margin decreased to approximately 33.2% during 2016 compared to approximately 34.1% during 2015. excluding the expensing of the fair market value of inventory step-up from the fairchild acquisition of $67.5 million, gross margin increased, primarily due to higher factory utilization and product mix.
gross margin decreased to approximately 34.1% during 2015 compared to approximately 34.3% during 2014. this decrease was primarily driven by a larger proportion of our revenues provided by our image sensor group which generates lower gross margin levels than our analog solutions group and power solutions group.
operating expenses research and development research and development expenses were $452.3 million, $396.7 million and $366.6 million, representing approximately 12%, 11% and 12% of revenues, for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the increase in research and development expenses of $55.6 million, or approximately 14%, during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily associated with the acquisition of fairchild, which added to several categories of research and development expenses totaling $28.8 million. research and development expenses unrelated to the fairchild transaction increased by $26.8 million, primarily in the area of payroll, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs, pension losses and ip related activities.
the increase in research and development expenses of $30.1 million, or approximately 8%, during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily associated with an increase of $50.4 million from expenses attributable to the operations of aptina and truesense for the full period in 2015. these expenses were partially offset by lower payroll costs, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs, in our analog solutions group and former system solutions group segment.
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were $238.0 million, $204.3 million and $200.0 million, representing approximately 6% of revenues in each year period, for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the increase in selling and marketing expenses of $33.7 million, or approximately 16%, during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily associated with the acquisition of fairchild, which had selling and marketing expenses of $26.7 million, primarily in the area of payroll, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs. there were also increases in expenses related to outside services and travel.
55
the increase in selling and marketing expenses of $4.3 million, or approximately 2%, during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily associated with an increase of $23.5 million for expenses attributable to the operations of aptina and truesense for the full period in 2015. these expenses were significantly offset by lower payroll costs, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs in our analog solutions group, power solutions group and former system solutions group segment.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were $230.3 million, $182.3 million and $180.9 million, representing approximately 6%, 5% and 6% of revenues, for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the increase in general and administrative expenses of $48.0 million, or approximately 26%, during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily associated with the acquisition of fairchild, which had general and administrative expenses of $36.9 million, primarily in the area of payroll, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs, outside services, travel related expenses, as well as acquisition related expenses.
the increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.4 million, or approximately 1%, during 2015 compared to 2014 includes an increase of approximately $14.6 million for expenses attributable to the operations of aptina and truesense for the full period in 2015, partially offset by lower payroll, including incentive compensation and payroll related costs in our power solutions group, analog solutions group and former system solutions group.
amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was $104.8 million, $135.7 million and $68.4 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease of $30.9 million during 2016 compared to 2015 was attributable to the declining amortization of our aptina and truesense intangible assets, partially offset by the amortization of our intangible assets acquired from the fairchild acquisition. amortization of acquired intangible assets from the fairchild transaction was $12.6 million between september 19, 2016 and december 31, 2016.
the increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets during 2015 compared to 2014 was attributable to a full period of the amortization of intangible assets assumed as a result of our acquisitions of aptina and truesense.
see note 4: acquisition and divestitures and note 5: goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information with respect to intangible assets.
restructuring, asset impairments and other, net restructuring, asset impairments and other, net was $33.2 million, $9.3 million and $30.5 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the information below summarizes the major activities in each year. for additional information, see note 6: restructuring, asset impairments and other, net in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
2016
during 2016, we recorded approximately $33.2 million of net charges related to our restructuring programs, consisting primarily of $25.7 million of post-fairchild acquisition restructuring costs, $5.3 million of former
56
system solutions group segment voluntary workforce reduction program costs, and $2.1 million of manufacturing relocation program costs.
2015
during 2015, we recorded approximately $9.3 million of net charges related to our restructuring programs, consisting primarily of $3.5 million of employee separation charges from our european marketing organization relocation plan and $4.8 million of general workforce reductions. total restructuring, asset impairments and other, net, was partially offset by a $3.4 million gain from the sale of assets.
during the first quarter of 2015, we announced that we would relocate our european customer marketing organization from france to slovakia and germany. as a result, six positions are expected to be eliminated. we recorded $3.5 million of related employee separation charges during 2015. the impacted employees left the company during the second half of 2016.
during the third quarter of 2015, management approved and commenced implementation of restructuring actions, primarily targeted workforce reductions. we notified approximately 150 employees of their employment termination, the majority of which had exited by the end of 2015. the total expense for 2015 was $4.8 million.
2014
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we initiated a voluntary retirement program for employees of certain of our former system solutions group segment subsidiaries in japan (the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program). approximately 350 employees opted to retire under the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, of which all employees had exited by the end of 2014. for 2014, we recognized approximately $10.4 million of employee separation charges related to the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program.
in connection with the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, approximately 70 contractor positions were also identified for elimination, all of which all had exited by the end of 2015. during 2014, an additional 40 positions were identified for elimination, as an extension of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, consisting of 20 employees and 20 contractors, substantially all of whom had exited by the end of 2014.
as a result of the q4 2013 voluntary retirement program, we recognized a pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees of $4.5 million during 2014, which is recorded in restructuring, asset impairments and other, net. see note 11: employee benefit plans in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
during 2014, we initiated further voluntary retirement activities applicable to an additional 60 to 70 positions for certain of our former system solutions group segment subsidiaries in japan, consisting of employees and contractors. substantially all personnel had exited under this program by december 31, 2014.
on october 6, 2013, we announced a plan to close kss (the kss plan). pursuant to the kss plan, a majority of the production from kss was transferred to other of our manufacturing facilities. the kss plan includes the elimination of approximately 170 full time and 40 contract employees. during 2014, we recorded approximately $7.8 million of employee separation charges and $2.3 million of exit costs related to the kss plan.
57
as a result of the kss facility closure, we recognized a $2.1 million pension curtailment benefit associated with the affected employees during 2014, which was recorded in restructuring, asset impairments and other, net. see note 11: employee benefit plans in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
indefinite and long-lived asset impairment charges
2016
during 2016, we canceled certain of our previously capitalized iprd projects and recorded impairment losses of $2.2 million included in the goodwill and intangible asset impairment caption in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
2015
during 2015, we canceled certain of our previously capitalized iprd projects and recorded impairment losses of $3.8 million included in the goodwill and intangible asset impairment caption in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
2014
during 2014, we determined that approximately $8.7 million in carrying value of goodwill relating to one of our reporting units in the analog solutions group was impaired resulting from a decline in estimated future cash flows. in connection with this impairment, we wrote-off approximately $0.9 million of intangible assets and $4.7 million of other long-lived assets.
see note 5: goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
other income and expenses interest expense interest expense increased by $95.6 million to $145.3 million during 2016 compared to $49.7 million in 2015, primarily due to the substantial indebtedness incurred in order to acquire fairchild. interest expense increased by $15.6 million, or approximately 46%, to $49.7 million during 2015, up from $34.1 million in 2014, primarily due to additional amortization of debt discount on our 1.00% notes. we expect interest expense to remain substantial in future periods as we service the debt we incurred in connection with the fairchild transaction. we recorded amortization of debt discount to interest expense of $26.0 million, $17.5 million and $7.0 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our average gross amount of long-term debt balance (including current maturities) during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $2,661.3 million, $1,361.6 million and $1,085.6 million, respectively. our weighted average interest rate on our gross amount of long-term debt (including current maturities) was approximately 5.5%, 3.7% and 3.1% per annum in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. see liquidity and capital resources - key financing and capital events below and note 8: long-term debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for a description of the indebtedness incurred for the fairchild transaction and our refinancing activities.
58
gain on divestiture of business gain on divestiture of business was $92.2 million during 2016. on august 29, 2016, the company sold two lines of business for $104.0 million in cash. in connection with the sale, the company recorded a gain of $92.2 million after, among other things, transferring inventory of $4.1 million to littelfuse, inc., writing off goodwill of $3.4 million, and deferring $4.3 million of the proceeds to be recognized in the future. see note 4: acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for further information.
loss on modification or extinguishment of debt
2016
loss on modification or extinguishment of debt increased by $5.9 million from $0.4 million to $6.3 million from 2015 to 2016, due to the execution of the first amendment, which resulted in a debt extinguishment charge of $4.7 million, and the termination and replacement of our senior revolving credit facility by the revolving credit facility, which resulted in a debt modification and write-off of $1.6 million in unamortized debt issuance costs.
2015
during 2015, we amended our senior revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion and reset the facilitys five year maturity. as a result of the amendment, we wrote-off $0.4 million of existing debt issuance costs associated with the facility, resulting in a loss during 2016.
other other income decreased by $8.3 million, from income of $7.7 million in 2015 to an expense of $0.6 million in 2016. other income increased by $12.1 million, from an expense of $4.4 million in 2014 to income of $7.7 million in 2015. the change from year to year is largely attributable to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the dollar for the period, net of the impact from our hedging activity, along with gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.
income tax provision (benefit)
we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.9 million, an income tax provision of $10.8 million and an income tax benefit of $0.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the income tax benefit for 2016 consisted primarily of the reversal of $359.8 million of our previously established valuation allowance against part of our u.s. federal and foreign deferred tax assets and the release of $1.9 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions which were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2016. this is partially offset by $310.8 million related to the reversal of the prior years indefinite reinvestment assertion, $43.5 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations and $3.5 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions.
the income tax provision for 2015 consisted of the reversal of $12.1 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets, the release of $4.3 million for reserves and interest
59
for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2015, and a change in tax rate that favorably impacted deferred balances by $1.6 million. this is partially offset by $24.4 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations and $4.4 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions.
the income tax benefit for 2014 consisted of the reversal of $23.3 million of our previously established valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets as a result of a net deferred tax liability recorded as part of the truesense acquisition and the reversal of $4.6 million for reserves and interest for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions that were effectively settled or for which the statute lapsed during 2014. this is partially offset by $19.8 million for income and withholding taxes of certain of our foreign and domestic operations, $4.6 million of new reserves and interest on existing reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign taxing jurisdictions, and $3.3 million of deferred federal income taxes associated with tax deductible goodwill.
our effective tax rate for 2016 was a benefit of 2.2%, which differs from the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the release of our u.s. and japan valuation allowances, partially offset by the reversal of the prior years indefinite reinvestment assertion. our effective tax rate for 2015 was a provision of 4.9%, which differs from the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate of 35% primarily due to our change in valuation allowance, deemed dividend income from foreign subsidiaries and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries. our effective tax rate for 2014 was a benefit of 0.1%, which differs from the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate of 35%, primarily due to our domestic tax losses and tax rate differential in our foreign subsidiaries.
the consummation of the fairchild acquisition during the quarter ended september 30, 2016 caused the company to reassess the prior years indefinite reinvestment assertion because of the u.s. debt incurred to fund the acquisition. see note 8: long-term debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information. this resulted in a change in judgment regarding the future cash flows by jurisdiction and the reversal of prior years indefinite reinvestment assertion. the change in assertion, which resulted in recording a deferred tax liability for future u.s. taxes, had a direct impact on the judgment about the realizability of the u.s. federal deferred tax assets which resulted in a release of valuation allowance. the change in the prior years indefinite reinvestment assertion resulted in an increase to income tax expense of $310.8 million, which was partially offset by a benefit of $267.9 million relating to the release of valuation allowance. the reversal of the prior years indefinite reinvestment assertion and release of the u.s. federal valuation allowance did not have an effect on our cash taxes.
we have not made an indefinite reinvestment assertion related to current year foreign earnings. we expect our future tax rate to more approximate the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35%. the effect of the increase in the future rate is not anticipated to have an effect on our cash tax until all of our u.s. federal net operating losses and credits have been utilized.
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on a portion of our foreign tax credits and foreign net operating losses, a substantial portion of which relate to japan net operating losses which are projected to expire prior to utilization. in addition, we also maintain a valuation allowance on a portion of our u.s. foreign tax credit carryforwards and a full valuation allowance on our u.s. capital loss carryforwards and u.s. state deferred tax assets.
for additional information, see note 15: income taxes in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.

liquidity and capital resources this section includes a discussion and analysis of our cash requirements, off-balance sheet arrangements, contingencies, sources and uses of cash, operations, working capital, and long-term assets and liabilities.
contractual obligations our principal outstanding contractual obligations relate to our long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases and purchase obligations. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31, 2016 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in the future (in millions):
payments due by period contractual obligations (1)                                                  total      2017               2018               2019               2020               2021                     thereafter long-term debt, excluding capital leases (2)                              $4,433.7             $660.0             $263.7             $176.4             $827.0             $117.5              $2,389.1

(1)   the table above excludes approximately $21.8 million of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the settlement of such liabilities.

(2)   includes interest payments at applicable rates as of december 31, 2016.

(3)   these represent our off-balance sheet arrangements (see liquidity and capital resourcesoff-balance sheet arrangements for a description of our off-balance sheet arrangements).

the table also excludes our pension obligations. we expect to make cash contributions to comply with local funding requirements and required benefit payments of approximately $12.1 million in 2017. this future payment estimate assumes we continue to meet our statutory funding requirements. the timing and amount of contributions may be impacted by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. beyond 2017, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. see note 11: employee benefit plans in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for more information on our pension obligations.
our balance of cash and cash equivalents was $1,028.1 million as of december 31, 2016. we believe that our cash flows from operations, coupled with our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. total cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2016 include approximately $399.0 million available in the united states. we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements, debt service, debt repayments and acquisitions. while we hold a significant amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries, we have the ability to obtain cash in the united states through distributions from our foreign
61
subsidiaries in order to cover our domestic needs, by utilizing existing credit facilities, or through new bank loans or debt obligations.
see note 8: long-term debt, in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for a discussion of our long-term debt. see market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities included elsewhere in this form 10-k for a discussion of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and our stock repurchase activities.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we enter into various operating leases for buildings and equipment including our mainframe computer system, desktop computers, communications, foundry equipment and service agreements relating to this equipment.
in the normal course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain parties initiated by either our subsidiaries or us, as required for transactions including, but not limited to: material purchase commitments; agreements to mitigate collection risk; leases; utilities; and customs guarantees. our senior revolving credit facility includes $15.0 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit. there were no letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2016. we had outstanding guarantees and letters of credit outside of our senior revolving credit facility of $6.7 million at december 31, 2016.
as part of securing financing in the normal course of business, we issued guarantees related to our capital lease obligations, equipment financing, lines of credit and real estate mortgages, which totaled approximately $130.7 million as of december 31, 2016. we are also a guarantor of sci llcs non-collateralized loan with smbc, which had a balance of $160.4 million as of december 31, 2016.
based on historical experience and information currently available, we believe that in the foreseeable future we will not be required to make payments under the standby letters of credit or guarantee arrangements.
for our operating leases, we expect to make cash payments and incur similar expenses totaling $148.9 million as payments come due. we have not recorded any liability in connection with these operating leases, letters of credit and guarantee arrangements.
contingencies we are a party to a variety of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties for certain liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the agreements. some of the agreements entered into by us require us to indemnify the other party against losses due to ip infringement, property damage including environmental contamination, personal injury, failure to comply with applicable laws, our negligence or willful misconduct, or breach of representations and warranties and covenants related to such matters as title to sold assets.
we face risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in economic damages, bodily injury or property damage. in addition, if any of our designed products are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in their recall. depending on the significance of any particular customer and other relevant factors, we may agree to provide more favorable rights to such customer for valid defective product claims.
62
we and our subsidiaries provide for indemnification of directors, officers and other persons in accordance with limited liability agreements, certificates of incorporation, by-laws, articles of association or similar organizational documents, as the case may be. we maintain directors and officers insurance, which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
the fairchild agreement provides for indemnification and insurance rights in favor of fairchilds then current and former directors, officers and employees. specifically, the company has agreed that, for no fewer than six years following the fairchild acquisition, (a) it will indemnify and hold harmless each such indemnitee against losses and expenses (including advancement of attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with any proceeding asserted against the indemnified party in connection with such persons servings as a director, officer, employee or other fiduciary of fairchild or its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the acquisition, (b) it will maintain in effect all provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries or any other agreements of fairchild or any of its subsidiaries with any indemnified party regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses in existence on the date of the fairchild agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition and (c) subject to certain qualifications, it will provide to fairchilds then current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the effective time of the acquisition that is no less favorable than fairchilds then-existing policy, or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage.
while our future obligations under certain agreements may contain limitations on liability for indemnification, other agreements do not contain such limitations and under such agreements it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. historically, payments made by us under any of these indemnities have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and we do not believe that any amounts that we may be required to pay under these indemnities in the future will be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
see legal proceedings and note 12: commitments and contingencies in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for possible contingencies related to legal matters. see also businessgovernment regulation for information on certain environmental matters.
sources and uses of cash we require cash to fund our operating expenses and working capital requirements, including outlays for strategic acquisitions and investments, research and development, to make capital expenditures, to repurchase our common stock and other company securities, and to pay debt service, including principal and interest and capital lease payments. our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations and funds from external borrowings and equity issuances. in the near term, we expect to fund our primary cash requirements through cash generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand. we also have the ability to utilize our revolving credit facility.
as part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and divestiture opportunities and proposals on a regular basis.
on september 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of fairchild pursuant to the fairchild agreement. the purchase price totaled $2,532.2 million and was funded by the borrowings against our term loan b facility
63
and revolving credit facility and with cash on hand. see business2016 acquisition activity, risk factors and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information. during 2015 and 2014, we acquired axsem, aptina and truesense. see note 4: acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
we believe that the key factors that could affect our internal and external sources of cash include:
                                                                         factors that affect our results of operations and cash flows, including the impact on our business and operations as a result of changes in demand for our products, competitive pricing pressures, effective management of our manufacturing capacity, our ability to achieve further reductions in operating expenses, the impact of our restructuring programs on our production and cost efficiency and our ability to make the research and development expenditures required to remain competitive in our business; and

                                                                        factors that affect our access to bank financing and the debt and equity capital markets that could impair our ability to obtain needed financing on acceptable terms or to respond to business opportunities and developments as they arise, including interest rate fluctuations, macroeconomic conditions, sudden reductions in the general availability of lending from banks or the related increase in cost to obtain bank financing, and our ability to maintain compliance with covenants under our debt agreements in effect from time to time.

our ability to service our long-term debt, including our 1.00% notes and term loan b facility, to remain in compliance with the various covenants contained in our debt agreements and to fund working capital, capital expenditures and business development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to, among other things, our future operating performance, as well as to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control.
if we fail to generate sufficient cash from operations, we may need to raise additional equity or borrow additional funds to achieve our longer term objectives. there can be no assurance that such equity or borrowings will be available or, if available, will be at rates or prices acceptable to us. we believe that cash flow from operating activities coupled with existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and existing credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operating and capital needs, as well as enable us to maintain compliance with our various debt agreements, through at least the next 12 months. to the extent that results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans, our liquidity may be adversely impacted.
during the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures for inventory, operating expenditures and capital expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected sales and demand. our capital expenditures are primarily directed toward production equipment and capacity expansion. our capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives. during 2016, we paid $210.7 million for capital expenditures, while in 2015 we paid $270.8 million. our current minimum commitment for 2017 is approximately $81.4 million. the capital expenditure levels can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives. our capital expenditures have historically been approximately 6% to 7% of annual revenues and we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures to support our business activities. future capital expenditures may be impacted by events and transactions that are not currently forecasted.
64
on april 15, 2016, we entered into two new financing arrangements to secure funds for the purchase consideration of fairchild among certain other items, including a $2.2 billion term loan b facility, with the proceeds deposited into escrow accounts and used to finance the transaction, which occurred on september 19, 2016. on september 30, 2016, we amended the financing arrangements and increased the term loan b facility by $200 million. the associated interest expense related to our term loan b facility has had, and will continue to have, a material impact to our results of operations throughout the term of the amended credit agreement.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we issued $690.0 million of our 1.00% notes and used a portion of the proceeds to pay down amounts previously drawn on our senior revolving credit facility. we also increased the borrowing capacity of our senior revolving credit facility from $800.0 million to $1.0 billion and reset the five year maturity. see note 8: long-term debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
on december 1, 2014, we announced a capital allocation policy (the capital allocation policy) under which we intend to return to stockholders approximately 80% of free cash flow less repayments of long-term debt, subject to a variety of factors, including our strategic plans, market and economic conditions and the boards discretion. for the purposes of the capital allocation policy, we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. we also announced the 2014 share repurchase program pursuant to the capital allocation policy. under the 2014 share repurchase program, we intend to repurchase approximately $1.0 billion of our common shares over a four year period, subject to the same factors and considerations described above. the 2014 share repurchase program was effective december 1, 2014, and the $300 million 2012 stock repurchase program was terminated on that date. see market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information with respect to our share repurchase program.
cash management our ability to manage cash is limited, as our primary cash inflows and outflows are dictated by the terms of our sales and supply agreements, contractual obligations, debt instruments and legal and regulatory requirements. while we have some flexibility with respect to the timing of capital equipment purchases, we must invest in capital equipment on a timely basis to allow us to maintain our manufacturing efficiency and support our platforms of new products.
primary cash flow sources our long-term cash generation is dependent on the ability of our operations to generate cash. our cash flows from operating activities were $581.2 million, $470.6 million, and $481.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
our cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased by approximately $110.6 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to the change in working capital during the period. our ability to maintain positive operating cash flows is dependent on, among other factors, our success in achieving our revenue goals and manufacturing and operating cost targets.
our management of our assets and liabilities, including both working capital and long-term assets and liabilities, also influences our operating cash flows, and each of these components is discussed below.
65
working capital working capital, calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities, fluctuates depending on end-market demand and our effective management of certain items such as receivables, inventory and payables. in times of escalating demand, our working capital requirements may be affected as we purchase additional manufacturing materials and increase production. our working capital may also be affected by restructuring programs, which may require us to use cash for severance payments, asset transfers and contract termination costs. in addition, our working capital may be affected by acquisitions and transactions involving our convertible notes and other debt instruments. our working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, was $338.1 million as of december 31, 2016 and has fluctuated between $33.9 million and $424.0 million at the end of each of our last eight fiscal quarters. our working capital, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, was $1,366.5 million as of december 31, 2016 and has fluctuated between $611.8 million and $1,366.5 million over the last eight quarter-ends. working capital as of december 31, 2015 was impacted by asu 2015-17, which we prospectively adopted and applied to our financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015 and subsequent periods. periods prior to december 31, 2015 have not been adjusted for the adoption of asu 2015-17. see note 3: recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
although investments made to fund working capital will reduce our cash balances, these investments are necessary to support business and operating initiatives. for the year ended december 31, 2016, our working capital was most significantly impacted by the acquisition of fairchild and the related financing. see note 8: long-term debt and note 9: earnings per share and equity in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
long-term assets and liabilities our long-term assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.
our manufacturing rationalization plans have included efforts to utilize our existing manufacturing assets and supply arrangements more efficiently. we believe that near-term access to additional manufacturing capacity, should it be required, could be readily obtained on reasonable terms through manufacturing agreements with third parties. we will continue to look for opportunities to make strategic purchases in the future for additional capacity.
our long-term liabilities, excluding long-term debt and deferred taxes, consist of liabilities under our foreign defined benefit pension plans and contingent tax reserves. in regard to our foreign defined benefit pension plans, generally, our annual funding of these obligations is equal to the minimum amount legally required in each jurisdiction in which the plans operate. this annual amount is dependent upon numerous actuarial assumptions. for additional information, see note 11: employee benefit plans and note 15: income taxes in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
key financing and capital events overview for the past several years, we have undertaken various measures to secure liquidity to pursue acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock, reduce interest costs, amend existing key financing arrangements and, in
66
some cases, extend a portion of our debt maturities to continue to provide us additional operating flexibility. certain of these measures continued in 2016. set forth below is a summary of certain key financing events affecting our capital structure during the last three years. for further discussion of our debt instruments see note 8: long-term debt and for further discussion on share repurchase program, see note 9: earnings per share and equity in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k.
recent events
2016 financing events on november 17, 2016, we announced that we would be exercising our option to redeem the entire $356.9 million outstanding principal amount of the 2.625% notes, series b, on december 20, 2016 pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2.625% notes, series b. the holders of the 2.625% notes, series b, had the right to convert their 2.625% notes, series b, into shares of common stock of the company at a conversion rate of 95.2381 shares per $1,000 principal amount until the close of business on december 19, 2016. we satisfied our conversion obligation with respect to the 2.625% notes, series b, tendered for conversion with cash. the final conversion was settled on january 26, 2017, resulting in an aggregate payment of approximately $445.0 million for the redemption and conversion of the 2.625% notes, series b.
on april 15, 2016, we entered into (1) a $600 million senior revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility) and a $2.2 billion term loan b facility (the term loan b facility), the terms of which are set forth in a credit agreement (the new credit agreement), dated as of april 15, 2016, by and among the company, as borrower, the several lenders party thereto, deutsche bank ag, new york branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the agent), and certain other parties, and (2) a guarantee and collateral agreement (the guarantee and collateral agreement) with certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the guarantors), pursuant to which the new credit agreement was guaranteed by the guarantors and secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the company and the guarantors, including a pledge of the equity interests in certain of the companys domestic and first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions. the obligations under the new credit agreement are also secured by mortgages on certain real property assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries. subject to the terms and conditions of the new credit agreement, on april 15, 2016, we borrowed an aggregate of $2.2 billion under the term loan b facility (the gross proceeds).
on april 15, 2016, the gross proceeds, along with certain other amounts funded by the company, were deposited into escrow accounts pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement and, upon release from escrow, in accordance with the terms of the escrow agreement, were available primarily to pay, directly or indirectly, the purchase price of the fairchild transaction pursuant to the terms of the fairchild agreement and certain other items, subject to the terms and conditions of the new credit agreement.
on september 19, 2016, the company completed the acquisition and acquired 100% of fairchild, whereby fairchild became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. the company funded the acquisition with the term loan b facility proceeds and company funded amounts previously deposited into escrow accounts, proceeds from a $200.0 million draw against the companys revolving credit facility, and existing cash on hand. proceeds from the term loan b facility were also used to pay for debt issuance costs, transaction fees and expenses.
on september 30, 2016, the company, entered into the first amendment (the first amendment) to the new credit agreement (the amended credit agreement). the first amendment reduced the applicable margins on
67
eurocurrency loans to 2.75% and 3.25% for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan b facility, respectively and reduced applicable margins abr loans to 1.75% and 2.25% for borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan b facility, respectively. additionally, the first amendment included the following: (i) the term loan b facility was increased to $2.4 billion; (ii) certain restructuring transactions and intercompany intellectual property transfers are permitted in order to achieve efficient integration of the company, its subsidiaries and acquired entities; and (iii) certain changes were made to the provisions regarding hedge agreements to allow the company and each of the guarantors to enter into certain hedge arrangements. the company used the additional $200.0 million proceeds under the term loan b facility to pay off the companys $200.0 million outstanding balance under the companys revolving credit facility.
2015 financing events issuance of 1.00% notes during the second quarter of 2015, we completed a private unregistered offering for an aggregate principal amount of $690.0 million of our 1.00% notes. the 1.00% notes mature on december 1, 2020, unless earlier purchased or converted. we concurrently entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with certain institutional counterparties. a portion of the proceeds from the offering were used to finance the hedge and warrant transactions associated with the issuance of the 1.00% notes, to pay down the senior revolving credit facility and to repurchase $70.0 million of our common stock. the issuance was a private placement made pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act.
amended senior revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2015, we amended our $800.0 million senior revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion and reset the five year maturity. we also amended the terms of the related amended and restated credit agreement. the facility includes $15.0 million of availability for the issuance of letters of credit, $15.0 million of availability for swingline loans for short-term borrowings and a foreign currency sublimit of $75.0 million. the facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, stock repurchase, and/or acquisitions.
share repurchase program during the year ended december 31, 2015, we purchased approximately 30.4 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $347.8 million, exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, at a weighted-average execution price of $11.46 per share. see market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information.
2014 financing events share repurchase program during the year ended december 31, 2014, we purchased approximately 13.9 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $121.0 million, exclusive of fees, commissions and other expenses, at a weighted-average execution price of $8.71 per share. see market for registrants common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for additional information.

amounts drawn on amended and restated senior revolving credit facility during the third quarter of 2014, we drew an incremental amount of approximately $230.0 million to partially fund the purchase of aptina. the outstanding balance of the facility as of december 31, 2014 was $350.0 million.
debt guarantees and related covenants as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the indentures relating to our 1.00% notes and our 2.625% notes, series b and with covenants relating to our term loan b facility, revolving credit facility and various other debt agreements. our 1.00% notes are senior to the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of on semiconductor and its guarantor subsidiaries. see note 8: long-term debt in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information.
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. we believe certain of our accounting policies are critical to understanding our financial position and results of operations. we utilize the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our financial statements.
use of estimates.    the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. significant estimates have been used by management in conjunction with the following: (i) measurement of valuation allowances relating to inventories and deferred tax assets; (ii) estimates of future payouts for customer incentives and allowances, warranties, and restructuring activities; (iii) assumptions surrounding future pension obligations; (iv) fair values of share-based compensation and of financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments); (v) evaluations of uncertain tax positions; (vi) estimates and assumptions used in connection with business combinations; and (vi) future cash flows used to assess and test for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, if applicable. actual results could differ from these estimates.
revenue.    we generate revenue from sales of our semiconductor products to oems, electronic manufacturing service providers and distributors. we also generate revenue, to a much lesser extent, from manufacturing and design services provided to customers. revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title and risk of loss pass to the customer (generally upon shipment), the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. revenues are recorded net of provisions for related sales returns and allowances.
for products sold to distributors who are entitled to returns and allowances (generally referred to as ship and credit rights within the semiconductor industry), we recognize the related revenue and cost of revenues depending on if the sale originated through an on semiconductor or legacy fairchild systems and processes. if the sale originated through an on semiconductor system and process, revenue is recognized when on semiconductor is informed by the distributor that it has resold the products to the end-user. as a result of our inability to reliably estimate up front the effects of the returns and allowances with these distributors for sales
69
originating through an on semiconductor system and process, we defer the related revenue and gross margin on sales to these distributors until it is informed by the distributor that the products have been resold to the end-user, at which time the ultimate sales price is known. legacy fairchilds systems and processes enable us to estimate up front the effects of returns and allowances provided to the distributors and thereby record the net revenue at the time of sale related to a legacy fairchild system and process. although payment terms vary, most distributor agreements require payment within 30 days.
for products sold to non-distributors, sales returns and allowances are estimated based on historical experience. our oem customers do not have the right to return products, other than pursuant to the provisions of our standard warranty. sales to distributors, however, are typically made pursuant to agreements that provide return rights with respect to discontinued or slow-moving products. provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenues are recognized, and are netted against revenues. we review warranty and related claims activities and records provisions, as necessary.
freight and handling costs are included in cost of revenues and are recognized as period expense when incurred. taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue-producing transactions, including value-added and excise taxes, are presented on a net basis (excluded from revenues) in the statement of operations.
inventories.    we carry our inventories at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or market and record provisions for potential excess and obsolete inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to historical and projected end-user demand. these provisions can influence our results from operations. for example, when demand falls for a given part, all or a portion of the related inventory that is considered to be in excess of anticipated demand is reserved, impacting our cost of revenues and gross profit. if demand recovers and the parts previously reserved are sold, we will generally recognize a higher than normal margin. however, the majority of product inventory that has been previously reserved is ultimately discarded. although we do sell some products that have previously been written down, such sales have historically been relatively consistent on a quarterly basis and the related impact on our margins has not been material.
impairment of long-lived assets.    we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be fully recoverable. impairment is first assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows derived for an asset group are less than its carrying amount. impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its fair value and are recognized in operating results. we continually apply our best judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset group. the dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting assumptions used to estimate future cash flows impact the outcome of our impairment tests. in recent years, most of our asset groups that have been impaired consist of assets that were ultimately abandoned, sold or otherwise disposed of due to cost reduction activities and the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities. in some instances, these assets have subsequently been sold for amounts higher than their impaired value with related gains recorded in the restructuring, asset impairment and other, net line item in our consolidated statement of operations and disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements.
goodwill.    we evaluate our goodwill for potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. our impairment evaluation of goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not
70
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if this qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis is required and goodwill is not impaired. otherwise, we follow a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test to determine if goodwill is impaired. the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. determining the fair value of our reporting units is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected net cash flows, discount and long-term growth rates. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows. estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments. the assumptions about future conditions include factors such as future revenues, gross profits, operating expenses, and industry trends. changes in these estimates based on evolving economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods. we consider other valuation methods, such as the cost approach or market approach, if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value. we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. actual future results may differ from those estimates. we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and growth rates to use in our analysis.
we have determined that the divisions within our company, which are components of our operating segments, constitute reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill. our divisions are one level below the operating segments, constituting individual businesses, with our segment management conducting regular reviews of the operating results. the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets associated with that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. if the carrying value of the net assets associate with the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. if, during this second step, we determine that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
our next annual test for impairment is expected to be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of 2017; however, identification of a triggering event may result in the need for earlier reassessments of the recoverability of our goodwill and may result in material impairment charges in future periods.
defined benefit pension plans and related benefits. we maintain defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our non-u.s. employees. for financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension costs and estimated withdrawal liabilities are determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates for plan obligations, assumed rates of return on pension plan assets and assumed rates of compensation increase for employees participating in the plans. these assumptions are based upon managements judgment and consultation with actuaries, considering all known trends and uncertainties. actual results that differ from these assumptions impact the expense recognition and cash funding requirements of our pension plans. as of december 31, 2016, a one percentage point change in the discount rate utilized to determine our continuing foreign pension liabilities and expense for our continuing foreign defined benefit plans would have impacted our results by approximately $4.7 million.
contingencies.    we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. based on the available information, we evaluate the relevant range and likelihood of potential outcomes and we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable.
71
income taxes.    income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized.
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance, estimated future taxable income, as well as feasible tax planning strategies for each taxing jurisdiction, are considered. if we determine it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets will not be realized, the valuation allowance will be increased with a charge to income tax expense. conversely, if we determine it is more likely than not to be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense.
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that is it more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement. our practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of tax audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in income tax expense in the period in which the change is made, which could have a material impact to our effective tax rate. see note 15: income taxes in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for additional information. see also managements discussion and analysis - results of operations - income tax provision (benefit) for additional information.

item 7a.     quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. to mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments. we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
as of december 31, 2016, our long-term debt (including current maturities) totaled $3,622.3 million. we have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $1,098.7 million. we do have interest
72
rate exposure with respect to the $2,708.1 million balance on our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of december 31, 2016. a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $13.5 million. however, some of this impact may be offset by additional interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents should rates on deposits and investments also increase. we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows resulting from future interest payments on our variable interest rate debt.
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions, we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with their underlying foreign currency exposures, from an accounting and economic perspective. however, given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of exposures intended to be hedged, we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.
we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the united states dollar as a normal part of the reporting process. our japanese operations utilize japanese yen as the functional currency, which results in a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
we enter into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other income and expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. the notional amount of foreign currency contracts at december 31, 2016 and 2015 was $95.9 million and $89.8 million, respectively. our policies prohibit speculation on financial instruments, trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.
substantially all of our revenue is transacted in u.s. dollars. however, a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are transacted in local currencies, including japanese yen, euros, korean won, malaysian ringgit, philippines peso, singapore dollars, swiss francs, chinese renminbi, and czech koruna. due to the materiality of our transactions in these local currencies, our results are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates measured against the u.s. dollar. for example, we determined that based on a hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates, our results would have impacted our income before taxes by approximately $68.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, assuming no offsetting hedge positions.
see note 14: financial instruments in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k for further information with respect to our hedging activity.

item 1a.    risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business.
risks related to our business and industry we are subject to the business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.
our business is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the hospitality industry, including:
•   significant competition from multiple hospitality providers in all parts of the world;
•   changes in operating costs, including energy, food, employee compensation and benefits and insurance;
•   increases in costs due to inflation or other factors that may not be fully offset by price and fee increases in our business;
•   changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;
•   the costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations;
•   the costs or desirability of complying with local practices and customs;
•   significant increases in cost for health care coverage for employees and potential government regulation with respect to health care coverage;
•   shortages of labor or labor disruptions;
•   the ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers;
•   the availability and cost of capital necessary for us and third-party hotel owners to fund investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations;
•   delays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects;
•   the quality of services provided by franchisees;
•   the financial condition of third-party property owners, developers and joint venture partners;
•   relationships with third-party property owners, developers and joint venture partners, including the risk that owners may terminate our management, franchise or joint venture agreements;
•   cyclical over-building in the hotel industry;
•   changes in desirability of geographic regions of the hotels in our business, geographic concentration of our operations and customers and shortages of desirable locations for development;
•   changes in the supply and demand for hotel services, including rooms, food and beverage and other products and services; and
•   decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to in-person meetings, including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks.
any of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for hospitality products and services, or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or develop new properties. as a result, any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.
13
macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services.
macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for hospitality products and services, including demand for rooms at our hotels. these factors include, but are not limited to:
•   changes in general economic conditions, including low consumer confidence, unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the u.s. or global economy;
•   governmental action and uncertainty resulting from u.s. and global political trends, including potential barriers to travel, trade and immigration;
•   war, political conditions or civil unrest, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;
•   decreased corporate or government travel-related budgets and spending, as well as cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business such as industry conventions;
•   statements, actions, or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel-related activities and the resulting negative public perception of such travel and activities;
•   the financial and general business condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries and its effect on travel, including decreased airline capacity and routes;
•   conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel, including travel-related accidents and outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as ebola, zika, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and h1n1 (swine flu);
•   cyber-attacks;
•   climate change or availability of natural resources;
•   natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, volcanic eruptions, oil spills and nuclear incidents;
•   changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers; and
•   organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for our hotels generally as a result of certain labor tactics.
any one or more of these factors could limit or reduce overall demand for our products and services or could negatively affect our revenue sources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.
consumer demand for our services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. decreased global or regional demand for hospitality products and services can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement. declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by limiting the amount of fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties and decreasing the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased properties. in addition, many of the expenses associated with our business, including personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities, are relatively fixed. during a period of overall economic weakness, if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our hotels decreases, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.
14
the hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility, which may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition.
the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. the periods during which our lodging properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the customer base served. we generally expect our revenues to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in each of the three subsequent quarters with the fourth quarter generally being the highest. in addition, the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis. the seasonality and cyclicality of our industry may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and financial condition.
because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues or profits could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively.
the segments of the hospitality industry in which we operate are subject to intense competition. our principal competitors are other operators of luxury, full service and focused service hotels, including other major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands. we also compete against smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators, home and apartment sharing services and timeshare operators. if we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues or profits may decline.
competition for hotel guests we face competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business. we compete for these customers based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, room rates, property size and availability of rooms and conference space, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. our competitors may have greater commercial, financial and marketing resources and more efficient technology platforms, which could allow them to improve their properties and expand and improve their marketing efforts in ways that could affect our ability to compete for guests effectively, or they could offer a type of lodging product that customers find attractive but that we do not offer.
competition for management and franchise agreements we compete to enter into management and franchise agreements. our ability to compete effectively is based primarily on the value and quality of our management services, brand name recognition and reputation, our ability and willingness to invest capital, availability of suitable properties in certain geographic areas, and the overall economic terms of our agreements and the economic advantages to the property owner of retaining our management services and using our brands. if the properties that we manage or franchise perform less successfully than those of our competitors, if we are unable to offer terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors, or if the availability of suitable properties is limited, our ability to compete effectively for new management or franchise agreements could be reduced.
any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.
our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of our brands and their associated reputation. in addition, the success of our hotel owners' businesses and their ability to make payments to us for our services may depend on the strength and reputation of our brands. if our brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality, we may be unable to attract guests to our hotels, and may further be unable to attract or retain our hotel owners.
changes in ownership or management practices, the occurrence of accidents or injuries, natural disasters, crime, individual guest notoriety or similar events at our hotels and resorts can harm our reputation, create adverse publicity and cause a loss of consumer confidence in our business. because of the global nature of our brands and the broad expanse of our business and hotel locations, events occurring in one location could negatively affect the reputation and operations of otherwise successful individual locations. in addition, the expansion of social media has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity. we also could face legal claims related to negative events, along with resulting adverse publicity. a perceived decline in the quality of our brands or damage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
15
our business is subject to risks related to doing business with third-party property owners that could adversely affect our reputation, operational results or prospects for growth.
unless we maintain good relationships with third-party hotel owners and renew or enter into new management and franchise agreements, we may be unable to expand our presence and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
our business depends on our ability to establish and maintain long-term, positive relationships with third-party property owners and our ability to enter into new and renew management and franchise agreements. although our management and franchise contracts are typically long-term arrangements, hotel owners may be able to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances, including the failure to meet specified financial or performance criteria. our ability to meet these financial and performance criteria is subject to, among other things, risks common to the overall hotel industry, including factors outside of our control. in addition, negative management and franchise pricing trends could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with hotel owners. if we fail to maintain and renew existing management and franchise agreements or enter into new agreements on favorable terms, we may be unable to expand our presence and our business, and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.
our business is subject to real estate investment risks for third-party owners that could adversely affect our operational results and our prospects for growth.
growth of our business is affected, and may potentially be limited, by factors influencing real estate development generally, including site availability, financing, planning, zoning and other local approvals. in addition, market factors such as projected room occupancy, changes in growth in demand compared to projected supply, geographic area restrictions in management and franchise agreements, costs of construction and anticipated room rate structure, if not managed effectively by our third-party owners could adversely affect the growth of our management and franchise business.
if our third-party property owners are unable to repay or refinance loans secured by the mortgaged properties, or to obtain financing adequate to fund current operations or growth plans, our revenues, profits and capital resources could be reduced and our business could be harmed.
many of our third-party property owners pledged their properties as collateral for mortgage loans entered into at the time of development, purchase or refinancing. if our third-party property owners are unable to repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, their lenders could declare a default, accelerate the related debt and repossess the property. a repossession could result in the termination of our management or franchise agreement or eliminate revenues and cash flows from the property. in addition, the owners of managed and franchised hotels depend on financing to buy, develop and improve hotels and in some cases, fund operations during down cycles. our hotel owners' inability to obtain adequate funding could materially adversely affect the maintenance and improvement plans of existing hotels, result in the delay or stoppage of the development of our existing pipeline and limit additional development to further expand our hotel portfolio.
if our third-party property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve their properties, guest preference for hilton brands and reputation and performance results could suffer.
substantially all of our management and franchise agreements, as well as our license agreement with hgv, require third-party property owners to comply with quality and reputation standards of our brands, which include requirements related to the physical condition, safety standards and appearance of the properties as well as the service levels provided by hotel employees. these standards may evolve with customer preference, or we may introduce new requirements over time. if our property owners fail to make investments necessary to maintain or improve the properties in accordance with our standards, guest preference for our brands could diminish. in addition, if third-party property owners fail to observe standards or meet their contractual requirements, we may elect to exercise our termination rights, which would eliminate revenues from these properties and cause us to incur expenses related to terminating these contracts. we may be unable to find suitable or offsetting replacements for any terminated relationships.
contractual and other disagreements with third-party property owners could make us liable to them or result in litigation costs or other expenses.
our management and franchise agreements require us and our hotel owners to comply with operational and performance conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements. any dispute with a property owner could be very expensive for us, even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor. we cannot predict the outcome of any arbitration or litigation,
16
the effect of any negative judgment against us or the amount of any settlement that we may enter into with any third party. furthermore, specific to our industry, some courts have applied principles of agency law and related fiduciary standards to managers of third-party hotel properties, which means that property owners may assert the right to terminate agreements even where the agreements do not expressly provide for termination. our fees from any terminated property would be eliminated, and accordingly may negatively affect our results of operations.
some of our existing development pipeline may not be developed into new hotels, which could materially adversely affect our growth prospects.
as of december 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,968 hotels in our development pipeline, which we define as hotels under construction or approved for development under one of our brands. the commitments of owners and developers with whom we have agreements are subject to numerous conditions, and the eventual development and construction of our pipeline not currently under construction is subject to numerous risks, including, in certain cases, the owner's or developer's ability to obtain adequate financing and obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals. as a result, not every hotel in our development pipeline may develop into a new hotel that enters our system.
new hotel brands or non-hotel branded concepts that we launch in the future may not be as successful as we anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we launched a new upscale brand, tapestry collection by hilton, in january 2017 and a new midscale brand, tru by hilton, in january 2016. we introduced a new brand, canopy by hilton, in october 2014, opened our first curio - a collection by hilton hotel in august 2014 and opened our first home2 suites by hilton hotel in 2011. we may continue to build our portfolio by launching new hotel and non-hotel brands in the future. in addition, the hilton garden inn, doubletree by hilton and hampton by hilton brands have been expanding into new jurisdictions outside the united states in recent years. we may continue to expand existing brands into new international markets. new hotel products or concepts or brand expansions may not be accepted by hotel owners, franchisees or customers and we cannot guarantee the level of acceptance any new brand will have in the development and consumer marketplaces.  if new branded hotel products, non-hotel branded concepts or brand expansions are not as successful as we anticipate, we may not recover the costs we incurred in their development or expansion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
the risks resulting from investments in owned and leased real estate could increase our costs, reduce our profits and limit our ability to respond to market conditions.
although we recently completed the spin-off of park, we still own or lease real property, which subjects us to various risks that may not be applicable to managed or franchised properties, including:
•   governmental regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations, including tax, environmental, zoning and eminent domain laws;
•
•   loss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which real estate is located;
•   increased potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties;
•   the ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties and to deliver properties back to landlords in a particular state of repair and condition at the end of a lease term;
•   periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements;
•   risks associated with any mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels and uncertainties in the availability of replacement financing;
•   fluctuations in real estate values or potential impairments in the value of our assets;
•   contingent liabilities that exist after we have exited a property;
•   costs linked to the employment and management of staff to run and operate an owned or leased property; and
•   the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets.
17
the negative effect on profitability and cash flow from declines in revenues is more pronounced in owned or leased properties because we, as the owner or lessee, bear the risk of their high fixed-cost structure. further, during times of economic distress, declining demand and declining earnings often result in declining asset values, and we may not be able to sell properties on favorable terms or at all. accordingly, we may not be able to adjust our owned and leased property portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.
our efforts to develop, redevelop or renovate our owned and leased properties could be delayed or become more expensive.
certain of our owned and leased properties were constructed many years ago. the condition of aging properties could negatively affect our ability to attract guests or result in higher operating and capital costs, either of which could reduce revenues or profits from these properties. there can be no assurance that our planned replacements and repairs will occur, or even if completed, will result in improved performance. in addition, these efforts are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   construction delays or cost overruns (including labor and materials);
•   obtaining zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations;
•   changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand for improvements that we make or negative project returns;
•   governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;
•   volatility in the debt and capital markets that may limit our ability to raise capital for projects or improvements;
•   lack of availability of rooms or meeting spaces for revenue-generating activities during construction, modernization or renovation projects;
•   force majeure events, including earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods or tsunamis, or acts of terrorism; and
•   design defects that could increase costs.
if our properties are not updated to meet guest preferences, if properties under development or renovation are delayed in opening as scheduled, or if renovation investments adversely affect or fail to improve performance, our operations and financial results could be negatively affected.
our properties may not be permitted to be rebuilt if destroyed.
certain of our properties may qualify as legally-permissible nonconforming uses and improvements, including certain of our iconic and most profitable properties. if a substantial portion of any such property were to be destroyed by fire or other casualty, we might not be permitted to rebuild that property as it now exists, regardless of the availability of insurance proceeds. any loss of this nature, whether insured or not, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.
we have investments in joint venture projects, which limits our ability to manage third-party risks associated with these projects.
in most cases, we are minority participants and do not control the decisions of the joint ventures in which we are involved. therefore, joint venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility that a co-venturer in an investment might become bankrupt, be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations, have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations. in addition, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our joint venture partners, or our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent. consequently, actions by a co-venturer or other third party could expose us to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our business and operations. in addition, we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a joint venture or co-venturer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other co-venturers. such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and several basis with a co-venturer, in which case we may be liable in the event that our co-venturer defaults on its guarantee obligation. the non-
18
performance of a co-venturer's obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we initially may have invested or committed.
preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures. any deficiencies in our joint ventures' internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud. such deficiencies also could result in restatements of, or other adjustments to, our previously reported or announced operating results, which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our shares. additionally, if our joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports.
although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow, in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture partners. additionally, in some cases our joint venture partners control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it. because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in part on their ability to distribute capital to us, our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments.
failures in, material damage to, or interruptions in our information technology systems, software or websites and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
we depend heavily upon our information technology systems in the conduct of our business. we own and license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems for property management, procurement, reservations and the operation of the hilton honors customer loyalty program. such systems are subject to, among other things, damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses and natural and man-made disasters. although we have a cold disaster recovery site in a separate location to back up our core reservation, distribution and financial systems, substantially all of our data center operations are currently located in a single facility. although we are migrating portions of our operations to cloud-based providers, any loss or damage to our primary facility could result in operational disruption and data loss as we transfer production operations to our disaster recovery site. damage or interruption to our information systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. in addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance.
we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions worldwide. in particular, our reservation system relies on data communications networks operated by unaffiliated third parties. the success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner. if we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services, or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner, we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all, and our business could be adversely affected.
we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. the inability of these developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs would disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner.
we are vulnerable to various risks and uncertainties associated with our websites and mobile applications, including changes in required technology interfaces, website and mobile application downtime and other technical failures, costs and issues as we upgrade our website software and mobile applications. additional risks include computer viruses, changes in applicable federal and state regulation, security breaches, legal claims related to our website operations and e-commerce fulfillment and other consumer privacy concerns. our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce website and mobile application sales and have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
19
cyber-attacks could have a disruptive effect on our business.
from time to time we and third parties who serve us experience cyber-attacks, attempted and actual breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events, which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations. the techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are difficult to detect for long periods of time, and we are accordingly unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents. in november 2015, we announced that we had identified and taken action to eradicate unauthorized malware that targeted payment card information in some point-of-sale systems in our hotels and had determined that specific payment card information was targeted by this malware. we expect we will be subject to additional cyber-attacks in the future and may experience data breaches.
even if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. the sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information systems has continued to increase in recent years. breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or company data could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications, point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us. such security breaches also could expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, litigation and other costs or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business.
we are exposed to risks and costs associated with protecting the integrity and security of our guests' personal data and other sensitive information.
we are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of sensitive information, including those related to compliance with u.s. and foreign data collection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations, as well as those associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information. we collect internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information for a variety of important business purposes, including managing our workforce, providing requested products and services and maintaining guest preferences to enhance customer service and for marketing and promotion purposes. we could be exposed to fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation, reputational harm or other expenses, or other adverse effects on our business, due to failure to protect our guests' personal data and other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various u.s. and foreign data collection and privacy laws or with credit card industry standards or other applicable data security standards.
in addition, states and the federal government have enacted additional laws and regulations to protect consumers against identity theft. these laws and similar laws in other jurisdictions have increased the costs of doing business, and failure on our part to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these laws could subject us to potential claims for damages and other remedies. if we were required to pay any significant amounts in satisfaction of claims under these laws, or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully with any such law, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.
we may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses and properties, or through alliances, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets. these acquisition and disposition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management's attention.
we may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other hotel or hospitality brands, businesses, properties or other assets. furthermore, we may pursue these opportunities in alliance with existing or prospective owners of managed or franchised properties. in many cases, we will be competing for these opportunities with third parties that may have substantially greater financial resources than us. acquisitions or investments in brands, businesses, properties or assets as well as these alliances are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:
•   issuing shares of stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders;
•   spending cash and incurring debt;
•   assuming contingent liabilities; or
•   creating additional expenses.
we may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all or we may not actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. similarly, we may not be able
20
to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms or at all, or the ability to obtain financing may be restricted by the terms of our indebtedness. in addition, the success of any acquisition or investment also will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations.
we also may divest certain properties or assets, and any such divestments may yield lower than expected returns or otherwise fail to achieve the benefits we expect. in some circumstances, sales of properties or other assets may result in losses. upon sales of properties or assets, we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations, incur material tax liabilities or, as a result of required debt repayment, face a shortage of liquidity. finally, any acquisitions, investments or dispositions could demand significant attention from management that would otherwise be available for business operations, which could harm our business.
failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position.
the hospitality industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for property management, brand assurance and compliance, procurement, reservation systems, operation of our customer loyalty programs, distribution of hotel resources to current and future customers and guest amenities. these technologies may require refinements and upgrades. the development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us. as various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required, we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a cost-effective and timely manner. we may not achieve the benefits we may have been anticipating from any new technology or system.
failure to comply with marketing and advertising laws, including with regard to direct marketing, could result in fines or place restrictions on our business.
we rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email and social media marketing and postal mailings, and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the u.s. and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices. any further restrictions in laws and court or agency interpretation of such laws, such as the telephone consumer protection act of 1991, the telemarketing sales rule, can-spam act of 2003, and various u.s. state laws, new laws, or international data protection laws, such as the eu general data protection regulation, that govern these activities could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy. if this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect our ability to maintain relationships with our customers and acquire new customers. we also obtain access to names of potential customers from travel service providers or other companies and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies' marketing materials. if access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new customers and introduce them to products could be impaired.
the growth of internet reservation channels could adversely affect our business and profitability.
a significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual guests are booked through internet travel intermediaries, to whom we commit to pay various commissions and transaction fees for sales of our rooms through their systems. search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our business. if these bookings increase, certain hospitality intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant concessions from us or our franchisees. these hospitality intermediaries also may reduce these bookings by de-ranking our hotels in search results on their platforms, and other online providers may divert business away from our hotels. although our agreements with many hospitality intermediaries limit transaction fees for hotels, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renegotiate these agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that existed before the expiration, replacement or renegotiation. moreover, hospitality intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites. as a result, consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries' offered brands, websites and reservations systems rather than to the hilton brands and systems. if this happens, our business and profitability may be significantly affected as shifting customer loyalties divert bookings away from our websites. internet travel intermediaries also have been subject to regulatory scrutiny, particularly in europe. the outcome of this regulatory activity may affect our ability to compete for direct bookings through our own internet channels.
in addition, although internet travel intermediaries have traditionally competed to attract individual consumers or "transient" business rather than group and convention business, in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business. if that growth continues, it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and also increase our cost of sales for group and convention business. consolidation of internet travel
21
intermediaries, and the entry of major internet companies into the internet travel bookings business, also could divert bookings away from our websites and increase our hotels' cost of sales.
our reservation system is an important component of our business operations and a disruption to its functioning could have an adverse effect on our performance and results.
we manage a global reservation system that communicates reservations to our branded hotels when made by individuals directly, either online, by telephone to our call centers or through devices via our mobile application, or through intermediaries like travel agents, internet travel web sites and other distribution channels. the cost, speed, efficacy and efficiency of the reservation system are important aspects of our business and are important considerations of hotel owners in choosing to affiliate with our brands. any failure to maintain or upgrade, and any other disruption to our reservation system may adversely affect our business.
the cessation, reduction or taxation of program benefits of our hilton honors loyalty program could adversely affect the hilton brands and guest loyalty.
we manage the hilton honors guest loyalty and rewards program for the hilton brands. program members accumulate points based on eligible stays and hotel charges and redeem the points for a range of benefits including free rooms and other items of value. the program is an important aspect of our business and of the affiliation value for hotel owners under management and franchise agreements. system hotels (including, without limitation, third-party hotels under management and franchise arrangements) contribute a percentage of the guest's charges to the program for each stay of a program member. in addition to the accumulation of points for future hotels stays at our brands, hilton honors arranges with third-party service providers, such as airlines and rail companies, to exchange monetary value represented by points for program awards. currently, the program benefits are not taxed as income to members. if the program awards and benefits are materially altered, curtailed or taxed such that a material number of hilton honors members choose to no longer participate in the program, this could adversely affect our business.
because we derive a portion of our revenues from operations outside the united states, the risks of doing business internationally could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.
we currently manage, franchise, own or lease hotels and resorts in 104 countries and territories around the world. our operations outside the united states represented approximately 20 percent and 22 percent of our revenues for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. we expect that revenues from our international operations will continue to account for an increasing portion of our total revenues. as a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside the united states, including:
•   rapid changes in governmental, economic and political policy, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or u.s. anti-boycott legislation;
•   increases in anti-american sentiment and the identification of the licensed brands as an american brand;
•   recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets;
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate;
•   the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreak of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult;
•   the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws;
•
•   the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate non-u.s. earnings in a tax-efficient manner;
•   the ability to comply with or effect of complying with complex and changing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, tariffs, embargoes, increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws;
22
•   instability or changes in a country's or region's economic, regulatory or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts or any other change resulting from the united kingdom's june 2016 vote to leave the european union (commonly known as "brexit");
•   uncertainties as to local laws regarding, and enforcement of, contract and intellectual property rights;
•   forced nationalization of our properties by local, state or national governments; and
•   the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries.
these factors may adversely affect the revenues from and the market value of our properties located in international markets. while these factors and the effect of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business operations.
failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs, reduce profits, limit growth or subject us to broader liability.
our business operations in countries outside the u.s. are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the fcpa, as well as trade sanctions administered by the ofac. the fcpa is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on u.s. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions, rules and regulations, it is possible that hotels we manage or own in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions. where we have identified potential violations in the past, we have taken appropriate remedial action including filing voluntary disclosures to ofac. in addition, some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of non-u.s. jurisdictions, including the u.k.'s bribery act 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations.
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of hotels and other properties, including the termination of management, franchising and ownership rights. in addition, in certain circumstances, the actions of parties affiliated with us (including our owners, joint venture partners, employees and agents) may expose us to liability under the fcpa, u.s. sanctions or other laws. these restrictions could increase costs of operations, reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth.
in august 2012, congress enacted the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 ("itrshra"), which expands the scope of u.s. sanctions against iran and syria. in particular, section 219 of the itrshra amended the exchange act to require sec-reporting companies to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates. these companies are required to separately file with the sec a notice that such activities have been disclosed in the relevant periodic report, and the sec is required to post this notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the u.s. president and certain u.s. congressional committees. the u.s. president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation with respect to certain disclosed activities, to determine whether sanctions should be imposed.
under itrshra, we are required to report if we or any of our "affiliates" knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our annual reports on form 10-k or quarterly reports on form 10-q. we have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, activities that would require disclosure pursuant to section 219 of itrshra. in addition, because the sec defines the term "affiliate" broadly, we may be deemed to be a controlled affiliate of blackstone or blackstone's affiliates or, following blackstone's proposed sale of our common stock to hna tourism group co., ltd. ("hna"), hna and hna's affiliates. other affiliates of blackstone or hna have in the past or may in the future be required to make disclosures pursuant to itrshra, including the activities discussed in the disclosures included on exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on form 10-k, which disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference herein. disclosure of such activities and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and brands and have a negative effect on our results of operations.
23
the loss of senior executives or key field personnel, such as general managers, could significantly harm our business.
our ability to maintain our competitive position depends somewhat on the efforts and abilities of our senior executives. finding suitable replacements for senior executives could be difficult. losing the services of one or more of these senior executives could adversely affect strategic relationships, including relationships with third-party property owners, significant customers, joint venture partners and vendors, and limit our ability to execute our business strategies.
we also rely on the general managers at each of our managed, owned and leased hotels to manage daily operations and oversee the efforts of employees. these general managers are trained professionals in the hospitality industry and have extensive experience in many markets worldwide. the failure to retain, train or successfully manage general managers for our managed, owned and leased hotels could negatively affect our operations.
collective bargaining activity could disrupt our operations, increase our labor costs or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.
a significant number of our employees (approximately 30 percent) and employees of our hotel owners are covered by collective bargaining agreements and similar agreements. if relationships with our employees or employees of our hotel owners or the unions that represent them become adverse, the properties we manage, franchise, own or lease could experience labor disruptions such as strikes, lockouts, boycotts and public demonstrations. a number of our collective bargaining agreements, representing approximately nine percent of our organized employees, have expired and are in the process of being renegotiated, and we may be required to negotiate additional collective bargaining agreements in the future if more employees become unionized. labor disputes, which may be more likely when collective bargaining agreements are being negotiated, could harm our relationship with our employees or employees of our hotel owners, result in increased regulatory inquiries and enforcement by governmental authorities and deter guests. further, adverse publicity related to a labor dispute could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. labor regulation and the negotiation of new or existing collective bargaining agreements could lead to higher wage and benefit costs, changes in work rules that raise operating expenses, legal costs and limitations on our ability or the ability of our third-party property owners to take cost saving measures during economic downturns. we do not have the ability to control the negotiations of collective bargaining agreements covering unionized labor employed by many third-party property owners. increased unionization of our workforce, new labor legislation or changes in regulations could disrupt our operations, reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies.
labor shortages could restrict our ability to operate our properties or grow our business or result in increased labor costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, train, manage and engage employees. we employ or manage more than 169,000 individuals at our managed, owned and leased hotels and corporate offices around the world. if we are unable to attract, retain, train, manage and engage skilled individuals, our ability to manage and staff the managed, owned and leased hotels could be impaired, which could reduce customer satisfaction. in addition, the inability of our franchisees to attract, retain, train, manage and engage skilled employees for the franchised hotels could adversely affect the reputation of our brands. staffing shortages in various parts of the world also could hinder our ability to grow and expand our businesses. because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at our hotels and our franchised hotels, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase labor costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, increase in minimum wage rates could increase costs and reduce profits for us and our franchisees.
any failure to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could reduce the value of the hilton brands and harm our business.
the recognition and reputation of our brands are important to our success. we have over 5,700 trademark registrations in jurisdictions around the world for use in connection with our services, plus at any given time, a number of pending applications for trademarks and other intellectual property. however, those trademark or other intellectual property registrations may not be granted or the steps we take to use, control or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property in the u.s. and other jurisdictions may not always be adequate to prevent third parties from copying or using the trademarks or other intellectual property without authorization. we may also fail to obtain and maintain trademark protection for all of our brands in all jurisdictions. for example, in certain jurisdictions, third parties have registered or otherwise have the right to use certain trademarks that are the same as or similar to our trademarks, which could prevent us from registering trademarks and opening hotels in that jurisdiction. third parties may also challenge our rights to certain trademarks or oppose our trademark applications. defending against any such proceedings may be costly, and if unsuccessful, could result in the loss of important
24
intellectual property rights. obtaining and maintaining trademark protection for multiple brands in multiple jurisdictions is also expensive, and we may therefore elect not to apply for or to maintain certain trademarks.
our intellectual property is also vulnerable to unauthorized copying or use in some jurisdictions outside the u.s., where local law, or lax enforcement of law, may not provide adequate protection. if our trademarks or other intellectual property are improperly used, the value and reputation of the hilton brands could be harmed. there are times where we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. litigation of this type could be costly, force us to divert our resources, lead to counterclaims or other claims against us or otherwise harm our business or reputation. in addition, we license certain of our trademarks to third parties. for example, we have granted hgv the right to use certain of our marks and intellectual property in its timeshare business and we grant our franchisees a right to use certain of our trademarks in connection with their operation of the applicable property. if hgv, a franchisee or other licensee fails to maintain the quality of the goods and services used in connection with the licensed trademarks, our rights to, and the value of, our trademarks could potentially be harmed. failure to maintain, control and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property could likely adversely affect our ability to attract guests or third-party owners, and could adversely affect our results.
in addition, we license the right to use certain intellectual property from unaffiliated third parties, including the right to grant sublicenses to franchisees. if we are unable to use this intellectual property, our ability to generate revenue from such properties may be diminished.
third-party claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others could subject us to damages and other costs and expenses.
third parties may make claims against us for infringing their patent, trademark, copyright or other intellectual property rights or for misappropriating their trade secrets. we have been and are currently party to a number of such claims and may receive additional claims in the future. any such claims, even those without merit, could:
•   be expensive and time consuming to defend, and result in significant damages;
•   force us to stop using the intellectual property that is being challenged or to stop providing products or services that use the challenged intellectual property;
•   force us to redesign or rebrand our products or services;
•   require us to enter into royalty, licensing, co-existence or other agreements to obtain the right to use a third party's intellectual property;
•   limit our ability to develop new intellectual property; and
•   limit the use or the scope of our intellectual property or other rights.
in addition, we may be required to indemnify third-party owners of the hotels that we manage for any losses they incur as a result of any infringement claims against them. all necessary royalty, licensing or other agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms. any adverse results associated with third-party intellectual property claims could negatively affect our business.
exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange hedging arrangements could result in significant foreign currency gains and losses and affect our business results.
conducting business in currencies other than the u.s. dollar subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative effect on our financial results. we earn revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies as part of our operations outside of the u.s. as a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly increase the amount of u.s. dollars required for foreign currency expenses or significantly decrease the u.s. dollars received from foreign currency revenues. we also have exposure to currency translation risk because, generally, the results of our business outside of the u.s. are reported in local currency and then translated to u.s. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, changes between the foreign exchange rates and the u.s. dollar will affect the recorded amounts of our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and could have a negative effect on our financial results. our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the u.s. increases.
25
to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exposure, we may enter into foreign exchange hedging agreements with financial institutions. however, these hedging agreements may not eliminate foreign currency risk entirely and involve costs and risks of their own in the form of transaction costs, credit requirements and counterparty risk.
if the insurance that we or our owners carry does not sufficiently cover damage or other potential losses or liabilities to third parties involving properties that we manage, franchise or own, our profits could be reduced.
we operate in certain areas where the risk of natural disaster or other catastrophic losses vary, and the occasional incidence of such an event could cause substantial damage to us, our owners or the surrounding area. we carry, and we require our owners to carry, insurance from solvent insurance carriers that we believe is adequate for foreseeable first- and third-party losses and with terms and conditions that are reasonable and customary. nevertheless, market forces beyond our control could limit the scope of the insurance coverage that we and our owners can obtain or may otherwise restrict our or our owners' ability to buy insurance coverage at reasonable rates. in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage that we and/or our owners carry may not be sufficient to pay the full value of our financial obligations, our liabilities or the replacement cost of any lost investment or property. because certain types of losses are uncertain, they may be uninsurable or prohibitively expensive. in addition, there are other risks that may fall outside the general coverage terms and limits of our policies.
in some cases, these factors could result in certain losses being completely uninsured. as a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenues, profits, management fees or franchise fees from the property.
terrorism insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates or at all.
following the september 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in new york city and the washington, d.c. area, congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of 2002, which established the terrorism risk insurance program (the "program") to provide insurance capacity for terrorist acts. the program expired at the end of 2014 but was reauthorized, with some adjustments to its provisions, in january 2015 for six years through december 31, 2020. we carry, and we require our owners and our franchisees to carry, insurance from solvent insurance carriers to respond to both first-party and third-party liability losses related to terrorism. we purchase our first-party property damage and business interruption insurance from a stand-alone market in place of and to supplement insurance from government run pools. if the program is not extended or renewed upon its expiration in 2020, or if there are changes to the program that would negatively affect insurance carriers, premiums for terrorism insurance coverage will likely increase and/or the terms of such insurance may be materially amended to increase stated exclusions or to otherwise effectively decrease the scope of coverage available, perhaps to the point where it is effectively unavailable.
terrorist attacks and military conflicts may adversely affect the hospitality industry.
the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september 11, 2001 underscore the possibility that large public facilities or economically important assets could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future. in particular, properties that are well-known or are located in concentrated business sectors in major cities where our hotels are located may be subject to the risk of terrorist attacks.
the occurrence or the possibility of terrorist attacks or military conflicts could:
•   cause damage to one or more of our properties that may not be fully covered by insurance to the value of the damages;
•   cause all or portions of affected properties to be shut down for prolonged periods, resulting in a loss of income;
•   generally reduce travel to affected areas for tourism and business or adversely affect the willingness of customers to stay in or avail themselves of the services of the affected properties;
•   expose us to a risk of monetary claims arising out of death, injury or damage to property caused by any such attacks; and
•   result in higher costs for security and insurance premiums or diminish the availability of insurance coverage for losses related to terrorist attacks, particularly for properties in target areas, all of which could adversely affect our results.
26
the occurrence of a terrorist attack with respect to one of our properties could directly and materially adversely affect our results of operations. furthermore, the loss of any of our well-known buildings could indirectly affect the value of our brands, which would in turn adversely affect our business prospects.
changes in u.s. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law, or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
we are subject to taxation at the federal, state or provincial and local levels in the u.s. and various other countries and jurisdictions. our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. from time to time, the u.s. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in u.s. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. in particular, our consolidated u.s. federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2006 through december 31, 2010 are under audit by the internal revenue service ("irs"), and the irs has proposed adjustments to increase our taxable income based on several assertions involving intercompany loans, our hilton honors guest loyalty and reward program and our foreign-currency denominated loans issued by one of our subsidiaries. in total, the proposed adjustments sought by the irs would result in u.s. federal tax owed of approximately $874 million, excluding interest and penalties and potential state income taxes. we disagree with the irs's position on each of the assertions and intend to vigorously contest them. additionally, the irs has notified us of its intention to examine the fiscal years ended december 31, 2011 through december 31, 2013. see note 18: "income taxes" in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information. an unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.
changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. a change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective, and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. see note 2: "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted.
changes to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations, may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations.
our total assets include goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, other intangible assets with finite useful lives and substantial amounts of long-lived assets, principally property and equipment, including hotel properties. we evaluate our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. we evaluate intangible assets with finite useful lives and long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results. after performing our evaluation for impairment, including an analysis to determine the recoverability of long-lived assets, we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. if the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment change, we may be required to record additional impairment losses on certain of these assets. if these impairment losses are significant, our results of operations would be adversely affected.
governmental regulation may adversely affect the operation of our properties.
in many jurisdictions, the hotel industry is subject to extensive foreign or u.s. federal, state and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the service of alcoholic beverages, the preparation and sale of food and those relating to building and zoning requirements. we are also subject to licensing and regulation by foreign or u.s. state and local departments relating to health, sanitation, fire and safety standards, and to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions status and citizenship requirements. in addition, the national
27
labor relations board has revised its standard for joint employee relationships, which could increase our risk of being considered a joint employer with our franchisees. we or our third-party owners may be required to expend funds to meet foreign or u.s. federal, state and local regulations in connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain of our properties. the failure to meet the requirements of applicable regulations and licensing requirements, or publicity resulting from actual or alleged failures, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
foreign or u.s. environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities.
we are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various foreign and u.s. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. these laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. our failure to comply with such laws, including any required permits or licenses, could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. we could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated real property (including managed and franchised properties) or at third-party locations in connection with our waste disposal operations, regardless of whether or not we knew of, or caused, the presence or release of such substances. from time to time, we may be required to remediate such substances or remove, abate or manage asbestos, mold, radon gas, lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties. the presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in third-party claims for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, business interruption or other losses. such claims and the need to investigate, remediate or otherwise address hazardous, toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations, the value of any affected real property, or our ability to sell, lease or assign our rights in any such property, or could otherwise harm our business or reputation. environmental, health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs may increase as a result. new or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of our properties or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us.
the cost of compliance with the americans with disabilities act and similar legislation outside of the u.s. may be substantial.
we are subject to the americans with disabilities act ("ada") and similar legislation in certain jurisdictions outside of the u.s. under the ada all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. these regulations apply to accommodations first occupied after january 26, 1993; public accommodations built before january 26, 1993 are required to remove architectural barriers to disabled access where such removal is "readily achievable." the regulations also mandate certain operational requirements that hotel operators must observe. the failure of a property to comply with the ada could result in injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private litigants or mandated capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. any imposition of injunctive relief, fines, damage awards or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of an owner or franchisee to make payments under the applicable management or franchise agreement or negatively affect the reputation of our brands. in november 2010, we entered into a settlement with the u.s. department of justice related to compliance with the ada. our obligations under this settlement expired in march 2015 except that certain managed and franchised hotels that were required to conduct surveys of their facilities remain under an obligation to remove architectural barriers at their facilities through march 15, 2022 and we have an obligation to have an independent consultant to monitor those barrier removal efforts during this period. if we fail to comply with the requirements of the ada, we could be subject to fines, penalties, injunctive action, reputational harm and other business effects that could materially and negatively affect our performance and results of operations.
28
casinos featured on certain of our properties are subject to gaming laws, and noncompliance could result in the revocation of the gaming licenses.
several of our properties feature casinos, most of which are operated by third parties. factors affecting the economic performance of a casino property include:
•   location, including proximity to or easy access from major population centers;
•   appearance;
•   local, regional or national economic and political conditions;
•   the existence or construction of competing casinos;
•   dependence on tourism; and
•   governmental regulation.
jurisdictions in which our properties containing casinos are located, including puerto rico and egypt, have laws and regulations governing the conduct of casino gaming. these jurisdictions generally require that the operator of a casino must be found suitable and be registered. once issued, a registration remains in force until revoked. the law defines the grounds for registration, as well as revocation or suspension of such registration. the loss of a gaming license for any reason would have a material adverse effect on the value of a casino property and could reduce fee income associated with such operations and consequently negatively affect our business results.
we are subject to risks from litigation filed by or against us.
legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of franchisees, third-party owners of managed properties, employees or customers may adversely affect our financial results. in recent years, a number of hospitality companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal laws and regulations regarding workplace and employment matters, consumer protection claims and other commercial matters. a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. similar lawsuits have been and may be instituted against us from time to time, and we may incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits of this type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. at any given time, we may be engaged in lawsuits or disputes involving third-party owners of our hotels. similarly, we may from time to time institute legal proceedings on behalf of ourselves or others, the ultimate outcome of which could cause us to incur substantial damages and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
risks related to our recent spin-offs we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spin-offs.
although we believe that separating our ownership business and our timeshare business by means of the spin-offs will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to us and our stockholders, the spin-offs may not provide results on the scope or scale we anticipate, and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits. for example, if the statutory and regulatory requirements relating to reits are not met by park, the benefits of spinning off the ownership business may be reduced or may be unavailable to us, our stockholders and stockholders of park. in addition, the costs we incur in connection with, or as a result of, the spin-offs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize. if we do not realize the intended benefits of the spin-offs or if our costs exceed our estimates, we or the businesses that were spun off could suffer a material adverse effect on our or their business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
the spin-offs could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.
we received a private letter ruling from the irs on certain issues relevant to qualification of the spin-offs as tax-free distributions under section 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). although the private letter ruling generally is binding on the irs, the continued validity of the private letter ruling will be based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the irs by us. further, the private letter ruling is limited to specified aspects of the spin-offs under section 355 of the code and does not represent a determination by the irs that all of the
29
requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied. moreover, if any statement or representation upon which the private letter ruling was based was incorrect or untrue in any material respect, or if the facts upon which the private letter ruling was based were materially different from the facts that prevailed at the time of the spin-offs, the private letter ruling could be invalidated. the opinion of tax counsel we received in connection with the spin-offs regarding the qualification of the spin-offs as tax-free distributions under section 355 of the code similarly relied on, among other things, the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by each of the spun-off companies and us which, if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by counsel in its opinion. the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts, and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts will not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail. additionally, recently enacted legislation denies tax-free treatment to a spin-off in which either the distributing corporation or the spun-off corporation is a reit and prevents a distributing corporation or a spun-off corporation from electing reit status for a 10-year period following a tax-free spin-off. under an effective date provision, the legislation does not apply to distributions described in a ruling request initially submitted to the irs before december 7, 2015. because our initial request for the private letter ruling was submitted before that date and because we believe the distribution has been described in that initial request, we believe the legislation does not apply to the spin-off of park. however, no ruling was obtained on that issue and thus no assurance can be given in that regard. in particular, the irs or a court could disagree with our view regarding the effective date provision based on any differences that exist between the description in the ruling request and the actual facts relating to the spin-offs. if the legislation applied to the spin-off of park, either the spin-off would not qualify for tax-free treatment or park would not be eligible to elect reit status for a 10-year period following the spin-off.
if the spin-offs and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, the company would be subject to a substantial tax liability that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, if the spin-offs were taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of park and hgv would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.
park or hgv may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that we have executed as part of the spin-offs.
in connection with the spin-offs, we, park and hgv entered into a distribution agreement and various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and, as to park, management agreements, and, as to hgv, a license agreement. certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other following the spin-offs. we are relying on park and hgv to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements. in addition, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us, park and hgv and require that we assume responsibility for certain obligations allocated to park and to hgv, particularly if park or hgv were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform such obligations. the impact of any of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could cause reputational harm and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
in connection with the spin-offs, each of park and hgv indemnified us for certain liabilities. these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by park and hgv, and park and hgv may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.
in connection with the spin-offs, each of park and hgv indemnified us with respect to such parties' assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the distribution agreement and breaches of the distribution agreement or other agreements related to the spin-offs. there can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of park and hgv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that park and hgv have agreed to assume. even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from park or hgv any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
if we are required to indemnify park or hgv in connection with the spin-offs, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, which could negatively affect our financial results.
pursuant to the distribution agreement entered into in connection with the spin-offs and certain other agreements among park and hgv and us, we agreed to indemnify each of park and hgv from certain liabilities. indemnities that we may be required to provide park and/or hgv may be significant and could negatively affect our business.

risks related to our indebtedness our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.
we have a significant amount of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2016, our total indebtedness, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts, was approximately $10.9 billion, including $696 million of timeshare debt, and our contractual debt maturities of our long-term debt and timeshare debt for the years ending december 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, were $179 million, $110 million and $543 million. our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences, including:
•   requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures or dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities;
•   increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;
•   exposing us to increased interest expense, as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness (whether fixed or floating rate interest) to be higher than they would be otherwise;
•   exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest;
•   making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness;
•   restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;
•   limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, satisfaction of debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.
we are a holding company, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are owned by, and most of our business is conducted through, our subsidiaries. revenues from these subsidiaries are our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses. if our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions to us, that may impair our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations. moreover, there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws, including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits. as a result, although a subsidiary of ours may have cash, we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations.
certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.
the indentures that govern our senior notes and the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. these restrictions limit our ability and/or the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:
•   incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;
•   pay dividends (including to us) and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;
•   make certain investments;
•   incur certain liens;
31
•   enter into transactions with affiliates;
•   merge or consolidate;
•   enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to the issuers;
•   designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and
•   transfer or sell assets.
in addition, if, on the last day of any period of four consecutive quarters on or after june 30, 2014, the aggregate principal amount of revolving credit loans, swing line loans and/or letters of credit (excluding up to $50 million of letters of credit and certain other letters of credit that have been cash collateralized or back-stopped) that are issued and/or outstanding is greater than 30 percent of the revolving credit facility, the credit agreement will require us to maintain a consolidated first lien net leverage ratio not to exceed 7.0 to 1.0.
as a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. the terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. we may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.
our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above, as well as other terms of our other indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. to a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. we may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. in addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives. finally, our ability to raise additional equity capital may be restricted by the stockholders agreement we entered into with hgv and certain entities affiliated with blackstone that is intended to preserve the tax-free status of the spin-offs of park and hgv.
despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.
we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future. although the credit agreements and indentures that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. these restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. to the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding three risk factors would increase.
32
risks related to ownership of our common stock the interests of certain of our stockholders may conflict with ours or yours in the future.
blackstone and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately 40.3 percent of our common stock as of december 31, 2016. hna has agreed to acquire 25 percent of our outstanding common stock from blackstone. moreover, under our bylaws and the stockholders' agreement with blackstone, for so long as it retains specified levels of ownership of us, we have agreed to nominate to our board individuals designated by blackstone. if blackstone's proposed sale of our common stock to hna closes, hna will have specified board designation rights, as described in our current report on form 8-k filed on october 24, 2016. thus, for so long as blackstone and hna continue to own specified percentages of our stock, each will be able to influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. accordingly, during that period of time, each of blackstone and hna will have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers. for example, for so long as blackstone or hna continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, blackstone or hna may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors occurs. the concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.
each of blackstone and hna and its respective affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in the hospitality industry. in the ordinary course of their business activities, each of blackstone and hna and their respective affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with ours or those of our stockholders. for example, blackstone owns interests in extended stay america, inc., la quinta holdings inc., park hotels & resorts inc. and hilton grand vacations inc., and certain other investments in the hospitality industry and may pursue ventures that compete directly or indirectly with us. hna acquired carlson hotels in december 2016 and has an interest in nh hotel group. in addition, affiliates of blackstone and hna directly and indirectly own hotels that we manage or franchise, and they may in the future enter into other transactions with us, including hotel development projects, that could result in their having interests that could conflict with ours. our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of blackstone, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. under the company's stockholders agreement with hna, the company agreed to renounce any interest or expectancy, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity or corporate opportunity presented to hna or its affiliates. blackstone or hna also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us. in addition, blackstone or hna may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their respective investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to you.
while we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we may change our dividend policy at any time.
although we currently pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our common stock, we have no obligation to do so, and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice to our stockholders. the declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors in accordance with applicable law after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated cash needs, limitations imposed by our indebtedness, legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.
future issuances of common stock by us, and the availability for resale of shares held by certain investors, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock. in addition, blackstone has pledged substantially all of the shares of our common stock held by it pursuant to a margin loan agreement and any foreclosure upon those shares could result in sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, which could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock.
pursuant to registration rights agreements, blackstone and certain management stockholders have, and hna will have, the right to cause us, in certain instances, at our expense, to file registration statements under the securities act covering resales of our common stock held by them. these shares represented approximately 41.2 percent of our outstanding common stock as of
33
december 31, 2016. these shares also may be sold pursuant to rule 144 under the securities act, depending on their holding period and subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates. as restrictions on resale end or if these stockholders exercise their registration rights, the market price of our stock could decline if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.
anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. among other things:
•   although we do not have a stockholder rights plan, and would either submit any such plan to stockholders for ratification or cause such plan to expire within a year, these provisions would allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;
•   these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent from and after the date on which blackstone ceases to beneficially own at least 40 percent of the total voting power of all then outstanding shares of our capital stock unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office, which would be the case upon closing of the hna transaction;
•   these provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and
•   these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
further, as a delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. these anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.
item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview our business hilton is one of the largest and fastest growing hospitality companies in the world, with 4,922 hotels, resorts and timeshare properties comprising 804,097 rooms in 104 countries and territories as of december 31, 2016. our premier brand portfolio includes: our luxury and lifestyle hotel brands, waldorf astoria hotels & resorts, conrad hotels & resorts and canopy by hilton; our full service hotel brands, hilton hotels & resorts, curio - a collection by hilton, doubletree by hilton and embassy suites by hilton; our focused service hotel brands, hilton garden inn, hampton by hilton, tru by hilton, homewood suites by hilton and home2 suites by hilton; our timeshare brand, hilton grand vacations; and our new full service brand, tapestry collection by hilton, launched in january 2017. we had approximately 60 million members in our award-winning customer loyalty program, hilton honors, as of december 31, 2016.
recent events on january 3, 2017, we completed the previously announced spin-offs of a portfolio of hotels and resorts, as well as our timeshare business, into two independent, publicly traded companies: park and hgv, respectively. the spin-offs were completed via a distribution to each of hilton's stockholders of record, as of the close of business on december 15, 2016, of 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of park and hgv. each hilton stockholder received one share of park common stock for every five shares of hilton common stock and one share of hgv common stock for every ten shares of hilton common stock. both park and hgv have their common stock listed on the nyse under the symbols "pk" and "hgv," respectively. unless otherwise stated, disclosures herein reflect the results of hilton, without giving effect to the spin-offs, for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. see item 1a. risk factors and note 29: "subsequent events" in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional discussion. refer to pro forma financial information included in our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on january 4, 2017 for the historical results of operations and performance of hilton giving effect to the spin-offs, and refer to the registration statements on form 10 of park and hgv and their subsequent periodic and other reports filed with the sec for their respective historical financial results. additionally, refer to our press release on our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results for our pro forma financial information for the year ended december 31, 2016 included in our current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on february 15, 2017.
on january 3, 2017, we completed a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of hilton's outstanding common stock. the authorized number of shares of common stock was reduced from 30,000,000,000 to 10,000,000,000, and the authorized number of shares of preferred stock remains 3,000,000,000. all share and share-related information presented in this annual report on form 10-k, including our consolidated financial statements, have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the decreased number of shares resulting from the reverse stock split.
in january 2017, we launched our newest brand, tapestry collection by hilton, which is a curated portfolio of original hotels in the upscale hotel segment that have recognizable features distinct to each hotel. tapestry guests are looking for new experiences and choose to stay where they can expect to never see the same thing twice. the first property is expected to open by the third quarter of 2017.
segments and regions during the periods covered by this report, management analyzed our operations and business by both operating segments and geographic regions, which consisted of three reportable segments that are based on similar products or services: ownership; management and franchise; and timeshare. the ownership segment primarily derives earnings from providing hotel room rentals, food and beverage sales and other services at our owned and leased hotels. the management and franchise segment provides services, which include hotel management and licensing of our brands to franchisees, as well as property management at timeshare properties. this segment generates its revenue from management and franchise fees charged to hotel owners, including our owned and leased hotels, and to homeowners' associations at timeshare properties. as a manager of hotels and timeshare resorts, we typically are responsible for supervising or operating the property in exchange for management fees. as a franchisor of hotels, we charge franchise fees in exchange for the use of one of our brand names and related commercial services, such as our reservation system, marketing and information technology services. the timeshare segment consists of
42
multi-unit vacation ownership properties and generates revenue by marketing and selling timeshare intervals owned by us and third parties, resort operations and providing consumer financing for the timeshare interests.
geographically, management conducts business through three distinct geographic regions: the americas; europe, middle east and africa ("emea"); and asia pacific. the americas region includes north america, south america and central america, including all caribbean nations. although the u.s. is included in the americas, it represents a significant portion of our system-wide hotel rooms, which was 75 percent as of december 31, 2016; therefore, the u.s. is often analyzed separately and apart from the americas geographic region and, as such, it is presented separately within the analysis herein. the emea region includes europe, which represents the western-most peninsula of eurasia stretching from ireland in the west to russia in the east, and the middle east and africa ("mea"), which represents the middle east region and all african nations, including the indian ocean island nations. europe and mea are often analyzed separately by management. the asia pacific region includes the eastern and southeastern nations of asia, as well as india, australia, new zealand and the pacific island nations. refer to "part i-item 2. properties" for the specific properties and respective locations of the properties that were distributed to park in connection with the spin-offs.
system growth and pipeline we continue to expand our global footprint and fee-based business. as we enter into new management and franchise contracts, we expand our business with minimal or no capital investment by us as the manager or franchisor, as the capital required to build and maintain hotels is typically provided by the third-party owner of the respective hotel that we contract with to provide management or franchise services. additionally, prior to approving the addition of new hotels to our management and franchise development pipeline, we evaluate the economic viability of the hotel based on the geographic location, the credit quality of the third-party owner and other factors. as a result, by increasing the number of management and franchise agreements with third-party owners, we expect to achieve a higher overall return on invested capital.
as of december 31, 2016, we had a total of 1,968 hotels in our development pipeline, representing approximately 310,000 rooms under construction or approved for development throughout 96 countries and territories, including 32 countries and territories where we do not currently have any open hotels. over 99 percent of the rooms in the pipeline are within our management and franchise segment. of the rooms in the pipeline, over 159,000 rooms, or more than half of the pipeline, were located outside the u.s. as of december 31, 2016, over 157,000 rooms, representing approximately half of our development pipeline, were under construction. we do not consider any individual development project to be material to us.
principal components and factors affecting our results of operations revenues principal components during the periods presented in this report, we primarily derived our revenues from the following sources:
•   owned and leased hotels. represents revenues derived from hotel operations, including room rentals, food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services. these revenues are primarily derived from two categories of customers: transient and group. transient guests are individual travelers who are traveling for business or leisure. group guests are traveling for group events that reserve rooms for meetings, conferences or social functions sponsored by associations, corporate, social, military, educational, religious or other organizations. group business usually includes a block of room accommodations, as well as other ancillary services, such as meeting facilities and catering and banquet services. a majority of our food and beverage sales and other ancillary services are provided to customers who are also occupying rooms at our hotel properties. as a result, occupancy affects all components of our owned and leased hotel revenues.
•   management and franchise fees and other. represents revenues derived from management fees earned from hotels and timeshare properties managed by us, franchise fees received in connection with the franchising of our brands and other revenue generated by the incidental support of hotel operations for owned, leased, managed and franchised properties and other rental income.
•   terms of our management agreements vary, but our fees generally consist of a base fee, which is typically a percentage of each hotel's gross revenue, and in some cases an incentive fee, which is based on gross operating profits, cash flow or a combination thereof. management fees from timeshare properties are generally a fixed amount as stated in the management agreement. outside of the u.s., our fees are often more dependent on hotel
43
profitability measures, either through a single management fee structure where the entire fee is based on a profitability measure, or because our two-tier fee structure is more heavily weighted toward the incentive fee than the base fee. additionally, we receive one-time upfront fees upon execution of certain management contracts, as well as a monthly fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the costs of advertising and marketing programs; internet, technology and reservation systems expenses; and quality assurance program costs. in general, the hotel owner pays all operating and other expenses and reimburses costs we incur in operating the hotel.
•   under our franchise agreements, franchisees pay us franchise fees which consist of initial application and initiation fees for new hotels entering the system and monthly royalty fees, generally calculated as a percentage of room revenues. royalty fees for our full service brands may also include a percentage of gross food and beverage revenues and other revenues, where applicable. in addition to the franchise application and royalty fees, franchisees also generally pay a monthly program fee based on a percentage of the total gross room revenue that covers the cost of advertising and marketing programs; internet, technology and reservation system expenses; and quality assurance program costs. we also earn fees when certain franchise agreements are terminated early or there is a change in ownership.
•   timeshare. represents revenues derived from the sale and financing of timeshare intervals and revenues from enrollments and other fees, rentals of timeshare units, food and beverage sales and other ancillary services at our timeshare properties, which we refer to as resort operations. additionally, in recent years, we began a transformation of our timeshare business to a capital light model in which third-party timeshare owners and developers provided capital for development while we acted as the sales and marketing agent and property manager. through these transactions, we received a sales and marketing commission and branding fees based on the total sales price of the timeshare interval, recurring fees to operate the homeowners' associations and revenues from resort operations.
•   other revenues from managed and franchised properties. these revenues represent the payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility, as well as certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties' operations, marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually either reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties when the costs are incurred. we have no legal responsibility for employees at franchised properties. the corresponding expenses are presented as other expenses from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income or net income.
factors affecting our revenues the following factors affected the revenues we derived from our operations during the periods presented:
•   consumer demand and global economic conditions. consumer demand for our products and services is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. declines in consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks affecting or reducing travel patterns, lower consumer confidence and adverse political conditions can lower the revenues and profitability of our owned and leased operations and the amount of management and franchise fee revenues we are able to generate from our managed and franchised properties. further, competition for hotel guests and the supply of hotel services affect our ability to sustain or increase rates charged to customers at our hotels. also, declines in hotel profitability during an economic downturn directly affect the incentive portion of our management fees, which is based on hotel profit measures. our timeshare segment also is linked to cycles in the general economy, consumer discretionary spending and availability of financing. as a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles have historically subjected and could in the future subject our revenues to significant volatility.
•   agreements with third-party owners and franchisees and relationships with developers. we depend on our long-term management and franchise agreements with third-party owners and franchisees for a significant portion of our management and franchise fee revenues. the success and sustainability of our management and franchise business depends on our ability to perform under our management and franchise agreements and maintain good relationships with third-party owners and franchisees. our relationships with these third parties also generate new relationships with developers and opportunities for property development that can support our growth. growth and maintenance of our hotel system and earning fees relating to hotels in the pipeline are dependent on the ability of developers and owners to access capital for the development, maintenance and renovation of properties. we believe that we have good relationships with our third-party owners, franchisees and developers and are committed to the continued growth and
44
development of these relationships. these relationships exist with a diverse group of owners, franchisees and developers and are not significantly concentrated with any particular third party.
additionally, we entered into sales and marketing agreements to sell timeshare intervals on behalf of third-party developers. we relied on these relationships to expand our timeshare interval supply without deploying capital for asset construction.
expenses principal components we primarily incurred the following expenses during the periods presented:
•   owned and leased hotels. reflects the operating expenses of our consolidated owned and leased hotels, including room expense, food and beverage costs, other support costs and property expenses. room expense includes compensation costs for housekeeping, laundry and front desk staff and supply costs for guest room amenities and laundry. food and beverage costs include costs for wait and kitchen staff and food and beverage products. other support expenses consist of costs associated with property-level management, utilities, sales and marketing, operating hotel spas, telephones, parking and other guest recreation, entertainment and services. property expenses include property taxes, repairs and maintenance, rent and insurance.
•   timeshare. includes the cost of inventory sold during the period, sales and marketing expenses, resort operations expenses and other overhead expenses associated with our timeshare business.
•   depreciation and amortization. these are non-cash expenses that primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets such as buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment at our consolidated owned and leased hotels and certain corporate assets, as well as amortization of our management and franchise intangibles and capitalized software.
•   general, administrative and other expenses. consists primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff and personnel supporting our business segments (including divisional offices that support our management and franchise segment), professional fees (including consulting, audit and legal fees), travel and entertainment expenses, bad debt expenses for uncollected management, franchise and other fees, contractual performance obligations and office administrative and related expenses. expenses incurred by our supply management business, laundry facilities and other ancillary businesses are also included in general, administrative and other expenses.
•   impairment losses. we hold significant amounts of goodwill, amortizing and non-amortizing intangible assets and long-lived assets. we evaluate these assets for impairment as further discussed in "-critical accounting policies and estimates." these evaluations have resulted in impairment losses for certain of these assets based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the assets and our estimates of fair value. based on economic conditions or other factors at a property-specific or company-wide level, we may be required to take additional impairment losses to reflect further declines in our asset values.
•   other expenses from managed and franchised properties. these expenses represent the payroll and related costs for properties that we manage where the property employees are legally our responsibility, as well as certain other operating costs of the managed and franchised properties' operations, marketing expenses and other expenses associated with our brands and shared services that are contractually either reimbursed to us by the property owners or paid from fees collected in advance from these properties when the costs are incurred. we have no legal responsibility for employees at franchised properties. the corresponding revenues are presented as other revenues from managed and franchised properties in our consolidated statements of operations resulting in no effect on operating income or net income.
factors affecting our costs and expenses the following are principal factors that affect the costs and expenses we incur in the course of our operations:
•   fixed expenses. many of the expenses associated with owning, leasing, managing and franchising hotels and timeshare resorts are relatively fixed. these expenses include personnel costs, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities. if we are unable to decrease these costs significantly or rapidly when demand for our hotels and other properties decreases, the resulting decline in our revenues can have an adverse effect on our net cash flow, margins
45
and profits. this effect can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. economic downturns generally affect the results of our ownership segment more significantly than the results of our management and franchising segment due to the high fixed costs associated with operating an owned or leased hotel. the effectiveness of any cost-cutting efforts is limited by the amount of fixed costs inherent in our business. as a result, we may not be able to offset revenue reductions through cost cutting. employees at some of our owned and leased hotels are parties to collective bargaining agreements that may also limit our ability to make timely staffing or labor changes in response to declining revenues. in addition, any efforts to reduce costs, or to defer or cancel capital improvements, could adversely affect the economic value of our hotels and brands. we have taken steps to reduce our fixed costs to levels we believe are appropriate to maximize profitability and respond to market conditions without jeopardizing the overall customer experience or the value of our hotels or brands. also, a significant portion of our costs to support our timeshare business relates to direct sales and marketing of these units. in periods of decreased demand for timeshare intervals, we may be unable to reduce our sales and marketing expenses quickly enough to prevent a deterioration of our profit margins on our timeshare business.
•   changes in depreciation and amortization expense. changes in depreciation expense may be driven by renovations of existing hotels, acquisition or development of new hotels, the disposition of existing hotels through sale or closure or changes in estimates of the useful lives of our assets. as we place new assets into service, we will be required to recognize additional depreciation expense on those assets. additionally, we capitalize costs associated with certain software development projects, and as those projects are completed and placed into service, amortization expense will increase.
other items effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations significant portions of our operations are conducted in functional currencies other than our reporting currency, which is the u.s. dollar ("usd"), and we have assets and liabilities denominated in a variety of foreign currencies. as a result, we are required to translate those results, assets and liabilities from the functional currency into usd at market based exchange rates for each reporting period. when comparing our results of operations between periods, there may be material portions of the changes in our revenues or expenses that are derived from fluctuations in exchange rates experienced between those periods.
seasonality the lodging industry is seasonal in nature. however, the periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location, type of property and competitive mix within the specific location. based on historical results, we generally expect our revenue to be lower during the first calendar quarter of each year than during each of the three subsequent quarters.
key business and financial metrics used by management comparable hotels we define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) were active and operating in our system for at least one full calendar year as of the end of the current period, and open january 1st of the previous year; (ii) have not undergone a change in brand or ownership during the current or comparable periods reported; and (iii) have not sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, undergone large-scale capital projects or for which comparable results are not available. of the 4,875 hotels in our system as of december 31, 2016, 3,740 have been classified as comparable hotels. our 1,135 non-comparable hotels included 135 properties, or approximately three percent of the total hotels in our system, that were removed from the comparable group during the year because they sustained substantial property damage, business interruption, underwent large-scale capital projects or comparable results were not available. of the 4,565 hotels in our system as of december 31, 2015, 3,624 were classified as comparable hotels for the year ended december 31, 2015.
occupancy occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels. occupancy measures the utilization of our hotels' available capacity. management uses occupancy to gauge demand at a specific hotel or group of hotels in a given period. occupancy levels also help us determine achievable adr levels as demand for hotel rooms increases or decreases.

adr adr represents hotel room revenue divided by total number of room nights sold in a given period. adr measures average room price attained by a hotel and adr trends provide useful information concerning the pricing environment and the nature of the customer base of a hotel or group of hotels. adr is a commonly used performance measure in the industry, and we use adr to assess pricing levels that we are able to generate by type of customer, as changes in rates have a different effect on overall revenues and incremental profitability than changes in occupancy, as described above.
revpar we calculate revpar by dividing hotel room revenue by total number of room nights available to guests for a given period. we consider revpar to be a meaningful indicator of our performance as it provides a metric correlated to two primary and key drivers of operations at a hotel or group of hotels: occupancy and adr. revpar is also a useful indicator in measuring performance over comparable periods for comparable hotels.
references to revpar, adr and occupancy are presented on a comparable basis and references to revpar and adr are presented on a currency neutral basis (all periods use the same exchange rates), unless otherwise noted.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda for a discussion of our definition of adjusted ebitda, see note 23: "business segments" in our consolidated financial statements.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized terms under u.s. gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with u.s. gaap. in addition, our definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) these measures are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. additionally, these measures exclude certain items that can vary widely across different industries and among competitors within our industry. for instance, interest expense and income tax expense are dependent on company specifics, including, among other things, our capital structure and operating jurisdictions, respectively, and, therefore could vary significantly across companies. depreciation and amortization are dependent upon company policies, including the method of acquiring and depreciating assets and the useful lives that are used. for adjusted ebitda, we also exclude items such as: (i) share-based compensation expense, as this could vary widely among companies due to the different plans in place and the usage of them; (ii) furniture, fixtures and equipment ("ff&e") replacement reserve to be consistent with the treatment of ff&e for its owned and leased hotels where it is capitalized and depreciated over the life of the ff&e; and (iii) other items that are not core to our operations and are not reflective of our performance.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under u.s. gaap. some of these limitations are:
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness;
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
•   ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations;
47
•   although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and
•   other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.
because of these limitations, ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

in 2016, we experienced system-wide revpar growth from continued adr growth at both of our hotel segments. regionally, the u.s., americas and europe all experienced revpar growth as a result of adr growth, with americas outpacing all other regions, driven by strength in canada and mexico. the asia pacific increase in revpar was driven by increased occupancy, particularly in china. mea performance continued to be negatively affected by geopolitical and terrorism concerns, resulting in a decrease in occupancy.

(1)   unfavorable movements were a result of the strengthening of the usd compared to other currencies, primarily the british pound ("gbp"), partially offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen ("jpy") compared to the usd.

(3)   represents comparable hotels for the year ended december 31, 2016.
the increase in comparable u.s. owned and leased hotel revenue during the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily a result of an increase in food and beverage revenue, as well as an increase in revpar of 0.4 percent, attributable to an increase in adr of 2.1 percent, largely offset by a decrease in occupancy of 1.4 percentage points. additionally, u.s. owned and leased hotel revenue increased in 2016 as a result of increases in revenues from properties acquired in february and june of 2015, net of the decrease in revenues from the waldorf astoria new york, which was sold in february 2015. excluding acquisitions and dispositions, revenues from non-comparable u.s. owned and leased hotels decreased for the year ended december 31, 2016, primarily as a result of renovations at one property during 2016.
the decrease in revenues at our international hotels during the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily a result of the effect of fx changes and decreases in revenues from properties disposed of between january 1, 2015 and december 31, 2016.

(1)   unfavorable movements were a result of the strengthening of the usd compared to other currencies, primarily the gbp and the euro.
(2)   from january 1, 2014 to december 31, 2015, 10 properties were added to our u.s. owned and leased portfolio on a net basis and five hotels were removed from our international owned and leased portfolio on a net basis.
(3)   represents comparable hotels for the year ended december 31, 2015.
the increase in revenues at our comparable u.s. owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily a result of an increase in revpar of 4.2 percent, which was mostly attributable to increases in both transient and group business. the increase in revenues at our non-comparable u.s. owned and leased hotels in 2015 was the result of the increase in revenues from properties acquired during 2015, net of the decrease in revenues from properties disposed of in 2015.
the decrease in revenues at our international owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily a result of the effect of fx changes and decreases in revenues from properties disposed of between january 1, 2014 and december 31, 2015. on a currency neutral basis, comparable international owned and leased hotel revenues increased as a result of an increase in revpar of 4.2 percent, which was primarily a result of an increase in transient guest business. additionally, excluding dispositions and fx changes, there was an increase in revenues at our non-comparable international owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the completion of large renovation projects at certain hotels, which had previously limited the availability of those properties to guests.

the increases in management and franchise fees for all periods were driven by increases in revenues from our non-comparable managed and franchised hotels due to the addition of new managed and franchised properties to our portfolio. including new development and ownership type transfers, from january 1, 2015 to december 31, 2016, we added 600 managed and franchised properties on a net basis, and from january 1, 2014 to december 31, 2015, we added 501 managed and franchised properties on a net basis, providing an additional 89,410 rooms and 81,474 rooms, respectively, to our managed and franchised segment. as new hotels stabilize in our system, we expect the fees received from such hotels to increase as they are part of our system for full periods.
additionally, our management and franchise fees increased during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of increases in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised hotels due to increases in adr. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, revpar increased 1.7
52
percent and 6.3 percent, respectively, at our comparable managed hotels, and 2.1 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, at our comparable franchised hotels. franchise fees also increased on a currency neutral basis as a result of increases in licensing fees of $16 million and $57 million during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

timeshare sales revenue increased during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of increases in commissions recognized from the sale of third-party developed timeshare intervals of $23 million and $136 million, respectively. during the year ended december 31, 2016, revenue from the sale of owned timeshare intervals increased $15 million due to increased sales volume. however, during the year ended december 31, 2015, sales volume of owned timeshare intervals decreased due to the shift in sales mix toward third-party developed interval sales, which resulted in a decrease of owned interval sales revenue of $21 million. overall timeshare sales volume increased 10 percent and 18 percent, respectively, during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, as a result of increased tour flow and net volume per guest. additionally, revenues from our resort operations increased during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 as a result of increases in fees earned related to our hilton grand vacations club, including fees generated by new members.

the increase in operating expenses at our u.s. owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily the result of increases at our comparable hotels due to higher variable operating costs due to increased occupancy. operating expenses at our non-comparable u.s. owned and leased hotels increased during the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in operating expenses from properties acquired in 2015, net of the decrease in operating expenses from properties disposed of in 2015.
the decrease in operating expenses at our international owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily a result of the effect of fx changes and decreases in operating expenses from properties disposed of between january 1, 2014 and december 31, 2015. on a currency neutral basis, operating expenses increased at our international comparable owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31, 2015, primarily as a result of increases in variable operating costs resulting from increased occupancy. additionally, excluding dispositions and fx changes, the increase in operating expenses at our non-comparable international owned and leased hotels during the year ended december 31, 2015 was consistent with the increase in revenues for these hotels. the changes were primarily the result of the completion of large renovation projects at certain hotels in 2015. the renovations limited occupancy and, therefore, reduced revenues and operating expenses.

timeshare sales expense increased during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily as a result of higher sales and marketing expenses related to increases in sales volume of third-party developed timeshare intervals for both periods and in sales volume of owned intervals for the year ended december 31, 2016. additionally, cost of product related to the reacquisition of owned timeshare inventory for customer upgrades into third-party developed properties decreased during the year ended december 31, 2016, partially offsetting the increase in sales and marketing expenses, and increased during the year ended december 31, 2015, contributing to the increase in timeshare sales expense.

the increases in depreciation expense during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, resulted primarily from the addition of property and equipment related to the properties acquired in 2015, partially offset by decreases as a result of disposed hotels. the decrease in amortization expense during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, and the increase in amortization expense during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, were primarily a result of $13 million in accelerated amortization that was recognized in 2015 on a management contract intangible asset for a property that was managed by us prior to our acquisition of it. the increase in amortization expense during the year ended december 31, 2015 was also related to capitalized software costs placed into service during 2014 and 2015.

general and administrative expense was unchanged during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, however, there were significant offsetting increases and decreases during the year. these included a decrease of $73 million in severance costs related to the sale of the waldorf astoria new york, as well as a decrease in share-based compensation expense due to $66 million of additional expense recognized during the year ended december 31, 2015, when certain remaining awards granted in connection with our initial public offering vested. the decreases were offset by an increase of $133 million of costs associated with the spin-offs.
the increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily a result of the recognition of approximately $95 million in severance costs related to the sale of the waldorf astoria new york and the additional $66 million of share-based compensation expense recognized during the year, as previously discussed. the increase was also a result of the reversal of accruals in 2014 related to the termination of a cash-based, long-term incentive plan that was replaced with our 2013 omnibus incentive plan, resulting in an $18 million reduction in general and administrative expense during the year ended december 31, 2014.

during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on the sale of one of our hotels held by a consolidated vie. see note 9: "consolidated variable interest entities" in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized gains upon completion of the sales of the hilton sydney and the waldorf astoria new york.

the increase in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily due to the issuance of new debt, partially offset by the reduction of principal on certain debt from prepayments and the amendment of our senior secured term loan facility entered into in 2013 (the "2013 term loans"), which extended the maturity and reduced the interest rate. see note 12: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements for details of our issuances and repayments related to financing transactions that occurred during the year ended december 31, 2016, as well as the interest rates for each debt instrument.
the decrease in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily as a result of a decrease in our indebtedness due to debt prepayments of $775 million on our 2013 term loans during the year, which resulted in lower debt principal balances on which interest expense was calculated.

the decrease in equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily due to a $17 million impairment loss for the impairment of one of our investments in affiliates recognized in 2016.
the increase in equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily due to improved performance at our unconsolidated hotels, partially offset by $3 million in equity in earnings included in the year ended december 31, 2014 from unconsolidated affiliates that were involved in an equity investments exchange or sold during that year.

the net loss on foreign currency transactions for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily related to changes in foreign currency rates on our short-term cross-currency intercompany loans, predominantly for loans denominated in australian dollar ("aud"), euro and gbp during the year ended december 31, 2016, and loans denominated in aud, brazilian real and gbp during the year ended december 31, 2015. the net gain on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily a result of changes in foreign currency rates on our short-term cross-currency intercompany loans, predominantly those denominated in gbp and aud.

the other loss, net for the year ended december 31, 2016 primarily related to the write-off of: (i) $20 million of unamortized debt issuance costs as a result of the full repayment of the commercial mortgage-backed securities loan entered into in 2013 (the "2013 cmbs loan"); and (ii) $4 million of debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the amendment of the 2013 term loans that were not capitalized.
the other loss, net for the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily related to $26 million of transaction costs from the acquisition of properties in connection with the tax deferred exchange, partially offset by a $24 million gain from the capital lease liability reduction from one of our consolidated vies.
the other gain, net for the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily related to a pre-tax gain of $23 million resulting from an equity investments exchange, as well as pre-tax gains of $13 million resulting from the sale of two hotels and a vacant parcel of land.

income tax expense for the year ended december 31, 2016 increased compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 primarily as a result of two corporate structuring transactions that were effected during the three months ended december 31, 2016 and included: (i) the organization of hilton's assets and subsidiaries in preparation for the spin-offs; and (ii) a restructuring of hilton's international assets and subsidiaries (the "international restructuring"). the international restructuring involved a transfer of certain assets, including intellectual property used in the international business, from u.s. subsidiaries to foreign subsidiaries and became effective in december 2016. the transfer of the intellectual property resulted in the recognition of tax expense representing the estimated u.s. tax expected to be paid in future years on income generated from the intellectual property transferred to foreign jurisdictions. further, our deferred effective tax rate is determined based upon the composition of applicable federal and state tax rates. due to the changes in the footprint of the company and the expected applicable tax rates at which our domestic deferred tax assets and liabilities will reverse in future periods as a result of the described structuring activities, our estimated deferred effective tax rate has increased. in total, these structuring transactions resulted in additional income tax expense of $513 million during the three months ended december 31, 2016. see note 18: "income taxes" in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion.
the decrease in income tax expense during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a $640 million deferred tax benefit resulting from transactions involving the conversion of certain u.s. subsidiaries from corporations to limited liability companies and the election to disregard certain foreign subsidiaries for u.s. federal income tax purposes. this benefit was offset by an increase in tax expense resulting from a $349 million increase in our income before income taxes. further, income tax expense was affected by the reduction in goodwill in connection with the sales of the waldorf astoria new york and the hilton sydney, as well as compensation costs incurred for certain awards granted in connection with our initial public offering for which no tax benefits were recognized.

december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily as a result of the decrease in owned and leased operating expenses of $84 million, partially offset by the decrease in ownership segment revenues. refer to "-revenues-owned and leased hotels" and "-operating expenses-owned and leased hotels" for further discussion of the changes in revenues and operating expenses at our owned and leased hotels.
management and franchise management and franchise segment revenues increased $95 million and $223 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily as a result of the net addition of hotels to our managed and franchised system, as well as increases in revpar at our comparable managed and franchised properties of 2.0 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. the increase in segment revenues was also due to an increase in licensing and other fees. refer to "-revenues-management and franchise fees and other" for further discussion on the increases in revenues from our managed and franchised properties. management and franchise adjusted ebitda increased in line with the increases in management and franchise segment revenues.
timeshare timeshare segment revenues increased $82 million and $137 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily as a result of increased timeshare sales revenue due to increases in commissions recognized from the sale of third-party developed intervals, as well as increased revenues from our resort operations. during the year ended december 31, 2016, timeshare sales revenue also increased from the sale of owned timeshare intervals. refer to "- revenues- timeshare" for further discussion of the changes in revenues from our timeshare segment.
timeshare adjusted ebitda increased $29 million and $15 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of the increases in timeshare revenues, partially offset by the increases in timeshare operating expenses of $51 million and $130 million, respectively. refer to "- revenues-timeshare" and "-operating expenses-timeshare" for a discussion of the changes in revenues and operating expenses from our timeshare segment.
supplemental financial data for unrestricted u.s. real estate subsidiaries as of december 31, 2016, we owned majority or controlling financial interests in 56 hotels, representing 28,931 rooms. see "part i-item 2. properties" for more information on each of our owned hotels. of these owned hotels, 36 hotels representing an aggregate of 23,570 rooms as of december 31, 2016, were owned by subsidiaries that we collectively refer to as our "unrestricted u.s. real estate subsidiaries." the unrestricted u.s. real estate subsidiaries are not subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the indentures that govern our senior notes due 2021 and the 4.25% senior notes due 2024 (together, the "senior notes"), which are unsecured.
we have included this supplemental financial data to comply with certain financial information requirements regarding our unrestricted u.s. real estate subsidiaries set forth in the indenture that governs our senior notes. upon completion of the spin-offs, our unrestricted u.s. real estate subsidiaries will not meet the threshold to constitute a "significant subsidiary" as defined by regulation s-x and we will no longer be required to disclose this supplemental financial data.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the unrestricted u.s. real estate subsidiaries represented 19.6 percent of our total revenues, 20.0 percent of income before income taxes, 43.1 percent of net income attributable to hilton stockholders and 23.6 percent of our adjusted ebitda, and as of december 31, 2016, represented 34.4 percent of our total assets and 24.2 percent of our total liabilities.

liquidity and capital resources overview as of december 31, 2016, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $1,684 million, including $266 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. the majority of our restricted cash and cash equivalents balance related to cash collateral on our self-insurance programs, escrowed cash from our timeshare operations and cash restricted in accordance with our long-term debt and timeshare debt agreements.
our known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and related benefits, legal costs, operating costs associated with the management of hotels, interest and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness, costs associated with the spin-offs, contract acquisition costs and capital expenditures for renovations and maintenance at our owned and leased hotels. our long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities, capital improvements at our owned and leased hotels, purchase commitments, dividends as declared, costs associated with potential acquisitions and corporate capital expenditures.
61
we finance our business activities primarily with existing cash and cash generated from our operations. we believe that this cash will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for operating expenses and other expenditures, including corporate expenses, payroll and related benefits, legal costs and purchase commitments for the foreseeable future. the objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain the availability of liquidity and minimize operational costs. further, we have an investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments and returning available capital to stockholders.
we and our affiliates, and/or our major stockholders and their respective affiliates, may from time to time purchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. purchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. the amounts involved may be material.
in preparation of the spin-offs that occurred on january 3, 2017, we completed several financing transactions during the year ended december 31, 2016. for further information on these transactions, see note 12: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements.

____________
(1)   fluctuation in terms of percentage change is not meaningful.
(2)   total current assets less total current liabilities.
our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.33, 1.06 and 1.12 as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
operating activities cash flow from operating activities is primarily generated from management and franchise fee revenue, operating income from our owned and leased hotels and sales of timeshare units.
the $57 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily as a result of an increase in net cash paid for taxes of $202 million, partially offset by improved operating results in our management and franchise and timeshare businesses.
the $100 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily as a result of improved operating results in each of our three business segments, as well as a decrease in cash paid for interest of $29 million, offset by an increase in net cash paid for income taxes of $46 million.
investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $478 million, and consisted primarily of capital expenditures, including contract acquisition costs and capitalized software costs.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, we generated $414 million in cash from investing activities primarily as a result of net proceeds from the tax deferred exchange of the waldorf astoria new york and the sale of the hilton sydney of $456 million and $331 million, respectively. this amount was partially offset by $409 million in capital expenditures, including contract acquisition costs and capitalized software costs.
62
during the year ended december 31, 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $310 million, and consisted primarily of capital expenditures, including contract acquisition costs and capitalized software costs.
our capital expenditures for property and equipment primarily include expenditures related to the renovation of existing owned and leased properties and our corporate facilities. our software capitalization costs relate to various systems initiatives for the benefit of our hotel owners and our overall corporate operations.
financing activities the $1,685 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from borrowings of $4,667 million, partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt of $2,735 million and an increase in cash dividends of $139 million. the borrowings comprised $4,415 million of long-term debt, of which $2,915 million was for park and $500 million was for hgv, and $300 million of additional borrowings under our timeshare financing receivables credit facility (the "timeshare facility"). we used proceeds from the borrowings and available cash to repay the outstanding balance of the 2013 cmbs loan of $3,418 million, $554 million of mortgage loans and $250 million on the 2013 term loans. for details of our issuances and repayments related to financing transactions that occurred during the year ended december 31, 2016, refer to note 12: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements. the increase in cash dividends was due to the declaration of quarterly cash dividends beginning in the third quarter of 2015 and continuing quarterly for the full year of 2016.
the $639 million increase in net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to a decrease in proceeds from borrowings of $302 million, an increase of repayments of debt of $200 million and the payment of cash dividends totaling $138 million in 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we repaid a $525 million mortgage loan and made $775 million in prepayments on our 2013 term loans, while during the year ended december 31, 2014 we made prepayments of $1.0 billion on our 2013 term loans. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2014, we issued $350 million of notes backed by timeshare financing receivables, of which $300 million of the proceeds was used to reduce the outstanding balance on our timeshare facility.
debt and borrowing capacity as of december 31, 2016, our total indebtedness, excluding $224 million of our share of debt of our investments in affiliates, was approximately $10.8 billion, including $694 million of timeshare debt. for further information on our total indebtedness, debt repayments and guarantees refer to note 12: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements.
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to reduce capital expenditures, issue additional equity securities or draw on our revolving credit facilities. our ability to make scheduled principal payments and to pay interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance, which is subject to general conditions in or affecting the hotel and timeshare industries that are beyond our control.
credit facilities as of december 31, 2016, we had three senior revolving credit facilities that provided for an aggregate of $2.2 billion in borrowings, including a $1.0 billion facility to remain with hilton after the spin-offs, and a $1.0 billion facility and a $200 million facility for park and hgv, respectively, to be transferred in connection with the spin-offs. these senior revolving credit facilities allowed for up to $230 million to be drawn in the form of letters of credit, with $50 million under park's facility, $30 million under hgv's facility and $150 million under hilton's facility. as of december 31, 2016, we had $45 million of letters of credit outstanding under hilton's facility, leaving us with a borrowing capacity of $955 million and there were no letters of credit or borrowings outstanding under park and hgv's facilities. for further information on our credit facilities and our guarantors' obligations thereunder, refer to note 12: "debt" in our consolidated financial statements.
in august 2016, we amended the terms of our timeshare facility to increase the borrowing capacity from $300 million to $450 million, allowing us to borrow up to the maximum amount until august 2018 and requiring all amounts borrowed to be repaid by august 2019. in december 2016, we borrowed an additional $300 million bringing our outstanding borrowings under the timeshare facility to $450 million as of december 31, 2016.
63
letters of credit we had a total of $45 million in letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the majority of which were outstanding under one of our revolving credit facilities and related to our guarantees on debt and other obligations of third parties and self-insurance programs. the maturities of the letters of credit were within one year as of december 31, 2016.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2016:

____________
(1)   we have assumed all extensions, which are solely at our option, were exercised.
(2)   includes principal, as well as estimated interest payments. for our variable-rate debt, we have assumed a constant 30-day libor rate of 0.72 percent as of december 31, 2016.
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31, 2016 was $253 million. these amounts are excluded from the table above because they are uncertain and subject to the findings of the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax. it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next year. refer to note 18: "income taxes" in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
in addition to the purchase commitments in the table above, in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments for which we are reimbursed by the owners of our managed and franchised hotels. these obligations have minimal or no effect on our net income and cash flow.
off-balance sheet arrangements our off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2016 included letters of credit of $45 million, guarantees of $5 million for debt and obligations of third parties, performance guarantees with possible cash outlays totaling approximately $69 million, of which we have accrued $28 million as of december 31, 2016 for estimated probable exposure, and construction contract commitments of approximately $43 million for capital expenditures at our owned, leased and consolidated vie hotels. our contracts contain clauses that allow us to cancel all or some portion of the work. if cancellation of a contract occurred, our commitment would be any costs incurred up to the cancellation date, in addition to any costs associated with the discharge of the contract. see note 24: "commitments and contingencies" in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. we believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 2: "basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies" in our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment, and the estimates required to be made were based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain. as a result, these accounting policies could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to reflect the current circumstances. while we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
64
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives we evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives for potential impairment by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the assets if we determine there are indicators of impairment. if it is determined that the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets, the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as impairment losses.
as part of the process described above, we exercise judgment to:
•   determine if there are indicators of impairment present. factors we consider when making this determination include assessing the overall effect of trends in the hospitality industry and the general economy, historical experience, capital costs and other asset-specific information;
•   determine the projected undiscounted future cash flows when indicators of impairment are present. judgment is required when developing projections of future revenues and expenses based on estimated growth rates over the expected useful life of the asset group. these estimated growth rates are based on historical operating results, as well as various internal projections and external sources; and
•   determine the asset fair value when required. in determining the fair value, we often use internally-developed discounted cash flow models. assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models include estimating cash flows, which may require us to adjust for specific market conditions, as well as capitalization rates, which are based on location, property or asset type, market-specific dynamics and overall economic performance. the discount rate takes into account our weighted average cost of capital according to our capital structure and other market specific considerations.
we had $8,930 million of property and equipment, net and $1,526 million of intangible assets with finite lives as of december 31, 2016. changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives could result in future impairment losses, which could be material.
investments in affiliates we evaluate our investments in affiliates for potential impairment when there are indicators that the fair value of our investment may be less than our carrying value. our investments in affiliates consist primarily of our interests in entities that own or lease hotels. as such, the factors we consider when determining if there are indicators of potential impairment are similar to property and equipment discussed above. we record an impairment loss when we determine there has been an "other-than-temporary" decline in the investment's fair value. if an identified event or change in circumstances requires an evaluation to determine if the value of an investment may have an other-than-temporary decline, we assess the fair value of the investment based on the accepted valuation methods, which include internally-developed discounted cash flow models. the principal factors used in our discounted cash flow models that require judgment are the same as the items discussed in property and equipment above. if an investment's fair value is below its carrying value and the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary, we will recognize an impairment loss in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates for equity method investments or impairment losses for cost method investments in our consolidated statements of operations.
we had $114 million of investments in affiliates as of december 31, 2016. changes in estimates and assumptions used in our impairment testing of investments in affiliates could result in future impairment losses, which could be material.
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value. our reporting units are the same as our operating segments as described in note 23: "business segments" in our consolidated financial statements. we perform this evaluation annually or at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist. in any given year we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if we cannot determine qualitatively that the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, or we decide to bypass the qualitative assessment, we proceed to the two-step quantitative process. in the first step, we
65
compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. when determining estimated fair value, we utilize discounted future cash flow models, as well as market conditions relative to the operations of our reporting units. under the discounted cash flow approach, we utilize various assumptions that require judgment, including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated long-term growth rates, and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital. our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, as well as various internal projections and external sources. the weighted average cost of capital is estimated based on each reporting units' cost of debt and equity and a selected capital structure. the selected capital structure for each reporting unit is based on consideration of capital structures of comparable publicly traded companies operating in the business of that reporting unit. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step must be performed. in the second step, we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill, which is determined by taking the fair value of the reporting unit and allocating it to all of its assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination.
we had $5,822 million of goodwill as of december 31, 2016. changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing could result in future impairment losses, which could be material. additionally, when a portion of a reporting unit is disposed, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained. when determining fair value of the businesses disposed of and the reporting unit to be retained, we use estimates and assumptions similar to that of those used in our impairment analysis.
brands we evaluate our brand intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the brand is below the carrying value. when determining fair value, we utilize discounted future cash flow models. under the discounted cash flow approach, we utilize various assumptions that require judgment, including projections of revenues and expenses based on estimated long-term growth rates and discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital. our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, as well as various internal estimates. if a brand's estimated current fair value is less than its respective carrying value, the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations within impairment losses.
we had $4,848 million of brand intangible assets as of december 31, 2016. changes in the estimates and assumptions used in our brands impairment testing, most notably revenue growth rates and discount rates, could result in future impairment losses, which could be material.
hilton honors hilton honors defers revenue received from participating hotels and program partners in an amount equal to the estimated cost per point of the future redemption obligation. we engage outside actuaries to assist in determining the fair value of the future award redemption obligation using statistical formulas that project future point redemptions based on factors that require judgment, including an estimate of "breakage" (points that will never be redeemed), an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed and the cost of the points to be redeemed. the cost of the points to be redeemed includes further estimates of available room nights, occupancy rates, room rates and any devaluation or appreciation of points based on changes in reward prices or changes in points earned per stay.
we had $1,432 million of guest loyalty liability as of december 31, 2016, including $543 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities. changes in the estimates used in developing our breakage rate or other expected future program operations could result in a material change to our guest loyalty liability.
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is related to the receivables generated by our financing of timeshare interval sales, which are secured by the underlying timeshare properties. we determine our timeshare financing receivables to be past due based on the contractual terms of the individual mortgage loans. we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis as the basis for determining our general reserve requirements on our timeshare financing receivables. the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management through analysis of several factors requiring judgment, such as current economic conditions and industry trends, as well as the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio, including assumed default rates.
we had $120 million of allowance for loan losses as of december 31, 2016. changes in the estimates used in developing our default rates could result in a material change to our allowance.
66
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized. in performing this review, we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income, the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. a change in these assumptions may increase or decrease our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, which could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
we use a prescribed more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if there is uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. assumptions and estimates are used to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. changes to these assumptions and estimates can lead to an additional income tax benefit (expense), which can materially change our consolidated financial statements.
legal contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required when we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. changes in these factors could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
consolidations we use judgment when evaluating whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity, including the assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights, as well as financial interests in an entity that are not controllable through voting interests. if the entity is considered to be a vie, we use judgment determining whether we are the primary beneficiary, and then consolidate those vies for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary. if the entity in which we hold an interest does not meet the definition of a vie, we evaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest through our voting interest in the entity. changes to judgments used in evaluating our partnerships and other investments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
share-based compensation the process of estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards and recognizing the associated expense over the requisite service period involves significant management estimates and assumptions. refer to note 20: "share-based compensation" in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion. any changes to these estimates will affect the amount of compensation expense we recognize with respect to future grants.

item 1a.   risk factors there are risks associated with an investment in our securities. the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risk factors could materially adversely affect our business, our prospects, our results of operations, our financial condition, our liquidity, the trading price of our securities, and/or the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods or if circumstances change.
recent changes in our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.
effective on november 2, 2015, mr. ralph lauren was appointed executive chairman and chief creative officer, and mr. stefan larsson was appointed president and chief executive officer and became a member of our board of directors. in addition to these recent changes, certain members of our executive and senior management team have departed, and we plan to continue to implement other management changes in connection with our long-term growth strategy. these changes in our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business. the departure of certain key executives and the failure to ensure a smooth transition and effective transfer of knowledge involving senior employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. any such disruption or uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock. further, such disruption may hinder our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002.
the loss of the services of mr. ralph lauren, members of our executive management team, or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.
mr. ralph lauren's leadership in the design and marketing areas of our business has been a critical element of our success since the inception of our company. mr. r. lauren is instrumental to, and closely identified with, our brand that bears his name. our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr. r. lauren's name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. the death or disability of mr. r. lauren or other extended or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we also depend on the service and management experience of other key executive officers, including mr. stefan larsson, our president and chief executive officer, and other members of senior management who have substantial experience and expertise in our industry and our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. the loss of the services of any of our key executive officers or other members of senior management, or one or more of our other key personnel, or the concurrent loss of several of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we are not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance covering our executive officers, including mr. r. lauren, or other members of senior management. we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, but competition for experienced executives in our industry is intense and the non-compete period with respect to certain of our executive officers could, in some circumstances in the event of their termination of employment with our company, end prior to the employment term set forth in their employment agreements.
we may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans, which could include the potential sale, discontinuance, or consolidation of certain of our brands.
we have implemented, and plan to continue to implement, restructuring plans to support key strategic initiatives, such as the global reorganization plan, as described in item 1 - "business - recent developments." these restructuring plans are designed to maintain long-term sustainable growth by enhancing our operating effectiveness and efficiency, right-sizing and increasing the quality of our distribution channels, and reducing our operating costs. restructuring plans present significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including:
•   higher than anticipated costs in implementing planned workforce reductions, particularly in highly regulated locations outside the u.s.;
20
•   higher than anticipated lease termination and store closure costs (see "our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases");
•   failure to meet operational targets or customer requirements due to the loss of employees or inadequate transfer of knowledge;
•   failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing, and subsequent to completing, our restructuring plans;
•   diversion of management attention from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale; and
•   attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce.
if we are not successful in implementing and managing our restructuring plans, we may not be able to achieve targeted operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.
as part of our historical growth strategy, we seek to extend our brands and merchandise categories, expand our geographic coverage, and increase direct management of our brands by opening more of our own stores and, from time to time, strategically acquiring or integrating into our existing operations select businesses previously held by our licensees, as well as to enhance our operations by creating a more demand-driven supply chain and right-sizing our cost structure.
we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our operations, hiring and retaining qualified key employees, or otherwise successfully managing such expansion. furthermore, we may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any licensee that we acquire into our own business, we may incur additional costs, and we may fail to achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration.
implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation and expansion of our retail distribution network on a global basis, including our e-commerce operations, which is subject to many factors beyond our control. we may not be able to procure, purchase, or lease desirable freestanding or department store locations, renew and maintain existing freestanding store leases and department store locations on acceptable terms, or secure suitable replacement locations. the lease negotiation, as well as the number and timing of new stores and shop-within-shop locations actually opened during any given period and their associated contribution to net income for the period, depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the availability of suitable financing to us and our landlords; (ii) the timing of the delivery of the leased premises to us from our landlords in order to commence build-out construction activities; (iii) our ability and our landlords' ability to obtain all necessary governmental licenses and permits to construct and operate our stores on a timely basis; (iv) our ability to manage the construction and development costs of new stores; (v) the rectification of any unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises; (vi) adverse weather conditions during the construction period; and (vii) the hiring and training of qualified operating personnel in the local market. in addition, the success of our e-commerce operations depends on our ability to maintain and upgrade our e-commerce platform to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience. while we continue to explore new markets and are always evaluating new potential locations, any of the above factors could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. further, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our e-commerce business, sales from our brick and mortar stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where e-commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and cannibalization.
in europe, we lack the large wholesale distribution channels we have in the u.s., and we may have difficulty developing and maintaining successful distribution strategies and alliances in certain major european countries. in asia, our primary mode of distribution is via a network of shops located within leading department stores. as we operate a direct-to-consumer business in this region and face established competitors, who in some cases maintain licensing relationships with such department stores, we may have difficulty in successfully retaining this network and expanding into alternate distribution channels. in addition, certain of the international countries in which we operate, particularly in asia, have unique operational characteristics that vary from the u.s., including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, acquiring store locations, and legal requirements, which may pose challenges to the execution and success of our related growth strategies. further, macroeconomic trends may not be favorable and could limit our ability to implement our growth strategies in select geographies where we have foreign operations, such as europe, asia, australia, new zealand, canada, and latin america.
21
achievement of our growth strategy requires investment in new capabilities, distribution channels, and technologies worldwide. these investments may result in short-term costs without accompanying current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. in addition, we may continue to incur costs in connection with repositioning our business in certain geographic areas, including in asia. although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized.
risks and uncertainties associated with the implementation of information systems may negatively impact our business.
we are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. for example, we are in the process of implementing a global operating and financial reporting information technology system, sap, as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our operational and financial systems and processes, which began during our fiscal year ended april 2, 2011. we substantially completed the migration of our north america operations to sap during fiscal 2015, and we are currently in the process of executing the migration of our european operations to sap, which is expected to be completed during fiscal 2017. in addition to implementing sap, we also completed the migration of our north america operations to a new procure-to-pay platform during fiscal 2016, and we expect to execute the migration of our european operations to this new platform during fiscal 2017. we are also in the process of building an in-house global e-commerce platform as part of our plan to further enhance our omni-channel capabilities. rollout of the new global e-commerce platform is expected to be completed in 2018.
implementation of new information systems, such as the global e-commerce platform and global operating and financial reporting system currently being implemented, involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design or implementation of such systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in the sourcing, sale, and shipment of our product, delays in the collection of cash from our customers, and/or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
a data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business.
we are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the internet, for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing. we are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e-commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. in our normal course of business, we often collect, retain, and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. there is significant concern by consumers, employees, and lawmakers alike over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet, consumer identity theft, and user privacy.
we have a longstanding information security risk program committed to regular risk management practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. this program includes various technical controls, including security monitoring, data leakage protection, network segmentation and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential or sensitive data. in response to recent security and risk trends, we continually evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, employees and partners, and have instituted additional measures to help protect us from system intrusion or data breaches. additionally, we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection, should a data breach occur.
despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other internet or email events. any perceived or actual electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to risks of litigation, fines and penalties, and liability, and result in deterioration in our customers' and employees' confidence in us, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, reduce our e-commerce net sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors, and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers. as these threats develop and grow, we may find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. in addition, as the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy is becoming increasingly demanding, we may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information.
22
our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.
we are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including in designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking, and distributing our products, processing payments, accounting for and reporting results, and managing our employees and employee benefit programs. we also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our retail segment and our wholesale customers, the movement of goods through distribution channels, and the collection of information for planning and forecasting. in addition, we have e-commerce and other internet websites in north america, europe, and asia, including australia and new zealand, and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in asia and other parts of the world. given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on a daily basis, it is imperative that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware and software systems. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses, malfunctions, or power outages. any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.
we generally purchase our products in u.s. dollars. however, we source most of our products overseas. as a result, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. changes in currency exchange rates may also impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while traveling, as well as affect the u.s. dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. in addition, the operating results of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as their financial results are translated from the respective local currency into u.s. dollars during the financial statement consolidation process. foreign currencies that we are exposed to from a transactional and translational perspective primarily include the euro, the japanese yen, the south korean won, the australian dollar, the canadian dollar, the swiss franc, the british pound sterling, the chinese renminbi, and the hong kong dollar. our international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. although we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot fully anticipate all of our currency exposures and therefore foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency markets, the accuracy of forecasted transactions, and the availability of hedging instruments. as such, our hedging activities may not completely mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. see item 7 - "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - market risk management."
the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands, to continue to develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers, and to provide a seamless shopping experience to our customers.
our success depends on the value of our brands and our ability to consistently anticipate and respond to customers' demands, preferences, and fashion trends in the design, pricing, and production of our products, including the preference for certain products to be manufactured in the u.s. any failure on our part to anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to these consumer demands, preferences, and trends could adversely affect acceptance of our products. the ralph lauren name is integral to our business and our business could be adversely affected if mr. ralph lauren's public image or reputation were to be tarnished. merchandise missteps or unfavorable publicity, especially through social media which accelerates and increases the potential scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact the image of our brands with our customers and could result in diminished loyalty to our brands, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable omni-channel experience for our customers. our business has evolved from an in-store experience to a shopping experience through multiple technologies, including computers, mobile phones, tablets, and other devices, as our customers have become increasingly technologically savvy. if we are unable to develop and continuously improve our customer-facing technologies, we may not be able to provide a convenient and consistent experience to our customers regardless of the sales channel. this could negatively affect our ability to compete with other retailers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
23
the success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing fashion and retail trends and consumer demands in a timely manner.
the industries in which we operate have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. our success depends in large part on our ability to originate and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change, influenced by fashion trends, current economic conditions, and weather conditions, among other factors. we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the future. in addition, we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers. any failure on our part to anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may harm our business and impair the image of our brands. conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may result in unfilled orders, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty, and result in lost revenues. any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
additionally, if our products do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, incur increased costs, and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. see item 1 - "business - sourcing, production and quality."
our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.
our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain our current level of operations in our existing international markets is subject to certain risks associated with operating in various international locations. these include, but are not limited to:
•   the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including trade, labor, and product safety trading restrictions;
•   compliance with u.s. and other country laws relating to foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the foreign corrupt practices act, which prohibits u.s. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and the u.k. bribery act, which prohibits u.k. and related companies from any form of bribery;
•   unexpected changes in laws, judicial processes, or regulatory requirements;
•   adapting to local customs and culture; and
•   new tariffs or other barriers in certain international markets.
we are also subject to general political and economic risks in connection with our international operations, including:
•   political instability and terrorist attacks;
•   changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and
•   general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.
we cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the u.s., the european union, asia, or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have, if any, on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social, economic, or monetary policies and other factors, including those which may result from the outcome of the 2016 u.s. presidential election, if any, may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future, or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices.
24
our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials, freight, or labor; or a manufacturer's inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. our products are manufactured to our specifications through arrangements with over 600 foreign manufacturers in various countries. in fiscal 2016, over 97% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the u.s., primarily in asia, europe, and latin america. risks inherent in importing our products include:
•   changes in social, political, and economic conditions, including those which may result from the outcome of the 2016 u.s. presidential election, or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located;
•   the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or exports, and costs of complying with laws relating to the identification and reporting of the sources of minerals used in our products;
•   the imposition of additional duties, taxes, and other charges on imports or exports;
•   significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials and commodities;
•   increases in the cost of labor, travel, and transportation;
•   disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and man-made disasters;
•   significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security considerations;
•   pandemic and epidemic diseases, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;
•   the imposition of anti-dumping or countervailing duty proceedings resulting in the potential assessment of special anti-dumping or countervailing duties; and
•   the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties either by the u.s. or its trading partners to remedy perceived illegal actions by national governments.
any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
in addition, the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our strict quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries, or a substantial reduction in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. prices of raw materials used to manufacture our products may also fluctuate, and increases in prices of such raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales. furthermore, the cost of labor at many of our third-party manufacturers has been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries such as china continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. the cost of transportation remains significant as well, and it is likely that such cost will fluctuate significantly if oil prices remain volatile. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, freight, or labor costs through pricing actions or other means.
our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices.
we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.
in addition, we require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. the violation of labor, environmental, or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's or licensing partner's labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. any of these events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
25
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. our business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers.
several of our department store customers, including some under common ownership, account for a significant portion of our wholesale net sales. a substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest department store customers. during fiscal 2016, sales to our largest wholesale customer, macy's, accounted for approximately 11% of total net revenues. further, sales to our three largest wholesale customers, including macy's, accounted for approximately 24% of total net revenues for fiscal 2016, and constituted approximately 36% of our total gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of april 2, 2016.
we typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers. instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our product lines every season. a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners or their new strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their "private label" initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. there can be no assurance that consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, or other ownership changes in the department store sector will not have a material adverse effect on our wholesale business. additionally, as a result of the recent unfavorable economic conditions, certain of our large wholesale customers, particularly those located in the u.s., have been highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise, including our products. such promotional activity could negatively impact our brand image and/or lead to requests from those customers for increased markdown allowances at the end of the season, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores across north america, europe, asia, australia, and latin america and extend credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer's financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. however, the financial difficulties of a wholesale customer could cause us to limit or eliminate our business with that customer. we may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. see item 1 - "business - wholesale credit control."
volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the heightened state of uncertainty surrounding the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world. the current global political and economic environments have resulted in continued economic unpredictability in the u.s., europe, and asia. although we believe that our cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and commercial paper borrowing program will provide us with sufficient liquidity, the impact of economic conditions on our major customers, suppliers, and lenders and their ability to access global capital markets cannot be predicted. the inability of major manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers. deterioration in global financial markets could affect our ability to access sources of liquidity to provide for our future cash needs, increase the cost of any future financing, or cause our lenders to be unable to meet their funding commitments under our credit facilities. a disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the downturn in the global economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the industries in which we operate are cyclical. many economic factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel, cosmetic, fragrance, accessory, jewelry, watch, and home product industries, including, among others:
•   general business conditions;
•   economic downturns;
•   employment levels;
26
•   downturns in the stock market;
•   interest rates;
•   foreign currency exchange rates;
•   the housing market;
•   consumer debt levels;
•   the availability of consumer credit;
•   commodity prices;
•   taxation; and
•   consumer confidence in future economic conditions.
consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income is lower. unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located. a downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in which we, or our licensing partners, sell our products may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. see item 7 - "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - current trends and outlook" for further discussion.
the domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence. the threat, outbreak, or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, or other hostilities could lead to a decrease in consumer spending and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.
we face increasing competition from companies selling apparel, accessories, home, and other of our product categories through the internet. although we sell our products through the internet, increased competition and promotional activity in the worldwide apparel, accessory, and home product industries from internet-based competitors could reduce our sales, prices, and margins and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
we also face intense competition from other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel, footwear, accessory, and casual apparel producers, some of which may be significantly larger and more diversified and may have greater financial and marketing resources than us. we compete with these companies primarily on the basis of:
•   anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;
•   creating and maintaining favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and a reputation for quality;
•   developing and maintaining innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers;
•   appropriately sourcing raw materials at cost-effective prices;
•   appropriately pricing products;
•   anticipating and maintaining proper inventory levels;
•   providing strong and effective marketing support;
•   recruiting and retaining key employees;
•   creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers;
•   ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain and distribution efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers;
•   obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail stores;
27
•   maintaining and growing market share; and
•   protecting our intellectual property.
any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced market share or sales, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.
our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional environment, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns. these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our costs. if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. in addition, changes in our customer, channel, and geographic sales mix could have a negative impact on our profitability.
our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the u.s.
we believe that our trademarks, intellectual property, and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. however, significant counterfeiting and imitation of our products continues, and in the course of our international expansion we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights to some trademarks that include polo and/or a representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks. we have in the past resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements, none of which, we believe, has had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or a material adverse effect on our business or brands arising from imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others. also, there can be no assurance that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all. in addition, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the u.s. and, as a result, our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to protect in such countries. see item 1 - "business - trademarks," and item 3 - "legal proceedings."
fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results.
we are subject to income taxes in many u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. in addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing tax laws, which could materially affect our income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations.
we have significant undistributed earnings held by our subsidiaries outside the u.s. as of april 2, 2016, we had $1.085 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $1.066 billion were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the u.s. we currently intend to reinvest these funds in order to fund strategic initiatives, working capital requirements, and debt repayments (both third-party and intercompany) of such foreign subsidiaries. however, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate any funds to the u.s. in the future, we would be subject to applicable u.s. and foreign taxes.
our company has an exclusive relationship with certain customers for some of our products. the loss or significant decline in business of these customers could negatively impact our business.
we have exclusive relationships with certain customers for the distribution of some of our products. our arrangement with these companies makes us dependent on those companies' financial and operational health for the sale of such products. the loss of these relationships could have an adverse effect on our business.
28
certain legal proceedings, regulatory matters, and accounting changes could adversely impact our results of operations.
we are involved in certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, escheatment and unclaimed property, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters, and other litigation. certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in material liability to our company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees, customers, licensees, or other third parties. in addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require our company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself. further, changes in governmental regulations both in the u.s. and in other countries where we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. see item 3 - "legal proceedings" for further discussion of our company's legal matters.
in addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations issued by the financial accounting standards board and other regulatory agencies. if and when effective, such changes to accounting standards could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. see note 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recent amendments to current accounting standards.
our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.
we have operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, in locations subject to natural disasters, such as severe weather, geological events, and pandemic and epidemic diseases, that could disrupt our operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in these locations and could experience similar disruptions. the occurrence of natural events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. in addition, our business is affected by unseasonable weather conditions, such as extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures in the winter or unseasonably cold temperatures in the summer. such natural events, including unseasonable weather conditions, could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
our business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers or distribution centers.
we compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, and thus may have an advantage in securing production capacity. if we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. we cannot guarantee that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us. see item 1 - "business - sourcing, production and quality." we enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications, and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. none of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.
in addition, we rely on a number of owned and independently-operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products to our customers and perform other related logistic services. as such, our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on the proper operation of these distribution centers. if any of our distribution centers were closed or were to become inoperable for any reason, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, disruption of deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, increased costs, and longer lead times associated with the distribution of products during the period that would be required to reopen or replace the facility. these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
29
our business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases.
we generally operate most of our retail stores under long-term, non-cancellable leasing arrangements. our leases typically require us to make minimum rental payments, and often contingent rental payments based upon sales. in addition, our leases generally require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance, and utilities. we generally cannot cancel our leases at our option. if an existing store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. in addition, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term. such costs and obligations related to the early termination of our leases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
the voting shares of our company's stock are concentrated in one majority stockholder.
as of april 2, 2016, mr. ralph lauren, or entities controlled by the lauren family, held approximately 82% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of our company. mr. r. lauren also serves as our executive chairman and chief creative officer, mr. r. lauren's son, mr. david lauren, is an executive officer of the company and a director on our board, and we employ other members of the lauren family. from time to time, we may have other business dealings with mr. r. lauren, members of the lauren family, or entities affiliated with mr. r. lauren or the lauren family. as a result of his stock ownership and position in our company, mr. r. lauren has the ability to exercise significant control over our business, including, without limitation, (i) the election of our class b common stock directors, voting separately as a class and (ii) any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets.
the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance, including our ability to return value to shareholders.
our business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. we believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. at the same time, however, we recognize that, from time to time, it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings. while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside analysts, or others, the market price of our securities could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.
we periodically return value to shareholders through our common stock share repurchases and payment of quarterly cash dividends. investors may have an expectation that we will repurchase all shares available under our class a common stock repurchase program and/or that we will further increase our quarterly cash dividend. the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our class a common stock share repurchase activity and/or cash dividend rate differs from investors' expectations.
we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses. failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our business.
the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing partner's business, including risks associated with a particular licensing partner's ability to:
•   obtain capital;
•   manage its labor relations;
•   maintain relationships with its suppliers and customers; and
•   manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively.
although a number of our license agreements prohibit our licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded from offering, under other non-competitor brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us. a substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic
30
licensing partners are also made to our largest customers. while we have significant control over our licensing partners' products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial control over their businesses. changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor execution, or financial difficulties with respect to any of our licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.
although we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners in most circumstances, if necessary, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. see item 1 - "business - our licensing segment."
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes, which are included in this annual report on form 10-k. we utilize a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to march 31. as such, fiscal 2016 ended on april 2, 2016 and was a 53-week period; fiscal 2015 ended on march 28, 2015 and was a 52-week period; and fiscal 2014 ended on march 29, 2014 and was also a 52-week period. fiscal 2017 will end on april 1, 2017 and will be a 52-week period.

•   recently issued accounting standards. this section discusses the potential impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition of certain accounting standards that have been recently issued or proposed.
overview our business our company is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, accessories, home furnishings, and other licensed product categories. our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. our brand names include ralph lauren, ralph lauren collection, ralph lauren purple label, polo ralph lauren, double rl, lauren ralph lauren, polo ralph lauren children, denim & supply ralph lauren, chaps, club monaco, and american living, among others.
we classify our businesses into three segments: wholesale, retail, and licensing. our wholesale business, which represented approximately 45% of our fiscal 2016 net revenues, consists of sales made principally to major department stores and specialty stores around the world. our retail business, which represented approximately 53% of our fiscal 2016 net revenues, consists of sales made directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and our e-commerce operations around the world. our licensing business, which represented approximately 2% of our fiscal 2016 net revenues, consists of royalty-based arrangements under which we license to unrelated third parties for specified periods the right to operate retail stores and/or to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings. approximately
35
37% of our fiscal 2016 net revenues were earned outside of the u.s. see note 21 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues, operating income, and total assets by reportable segment, as well as net revenues and long-lived assets by geographic location.
our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters. these trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail segment.
current trends and outlook the global economy continues to be in a heightened state of uncertainty, as productivity growth in both advanced and emerging countries remains low. certain worldwide events, including political unrest, disease epidemics, monetary policy changes, and currency and commodity price volatility, as well as china's recent economic slowdown, continue to impact consumer confidence and the global economy as a whole, as well as the world's stock markets. while certain geographic regions are withstanding these pressures better than others, the level of consumer travel and spending on discretionary items remains constrained in certain markets, with trends likely to continue in 2016. additionally, consumers are increasingly spending more of their discretionary income on "experiences," such as dining and entertainment, over consumer goods. consequently, consumer retail traffic remains relatively weak and inconsistent, which has led to increased competition and a desire to offset traffic declines with increased levels of conversion. certain of our operations have experienced, and have been impacted by, these dynamics, with variations across the geographic regions and businesses in which we operate.
if the current economic conditions and challenging industry trends continue or worsen, the constrained level of worldwide consumer spending and modified consumption behavior may continue to have a negative effect on our sales, inventory levels, and operating margin in fiscal 2017. furthermore, our results have been, and are expected to continue to be, negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. we have initiated various operating strategies to mitigate these challenges, and remain optimistic about our future growth prospects. accordingly, we continue to invest in our longer-term growth initiatives, including our restructuring activities, as described within "recent developments" below, while continually monitoring macroeconomic risks and remaining focused on disciplined expense management. although we continue to expect that the dilutive effects of investments that we are making in our business will create operating margin pressure in the near-term, we expect that these initiatives will create longer-term shareholder value. we will continue to monitor these risks and evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and foreign currency and cost management opportunities to mitigate the related impact on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting the value of our brand.
for a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see part i, item 1a - "risk factors" included in this annual report on form 10-k.
summary of financial performance operating results in fiscal 2016, we reported net revenues of $7.405 billion, net income of $396 million, and net income per diluted share of $4.62, as compared to net revenues of $7.620 billion, net income of $702 million, and net income per diluted share of $7.88 in fiscal 2015. the comparability of our operating results has been affected by charges incurred in connection with the global reorganization plan (as defined within "recent developments" below), other charges primarily related to a pending customs audit and the settlement of certain litigation claims, unfavorable foreign currency effects, and the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, all as discussed further below.
during fiscal 2016, net revenues declined 2.8% on a reported basis and increased 0.8% on a constant currency basis, as defined within "transactions and trends affecting comparability of results of operations and financial condition" below. the decline in reported net revenues during fiscal 2016 reflected lower net revenues from our wholesale and retail businesses, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency effects and a more competitive retail environment, partially offset by the favorable impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $72 million. our gross margin percentage declined by 100 basis points to 56.5% during fiscal 2016, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency effects and certain non-cash charges recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan, partially offset by increased profitability largely attributable to favorable channel mix. selling, general, and administrative ("sg&a") expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased by 250 basis points to 45.8% during fiscal 2016, primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues due in part to unfavorable foreign currency effects, and increased investments in our stores, facilities, and infrastructure consistent with our longer-term initiatives.
36
net income declined by $306 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to a $453 million decrease in operating income, partially offset by a $129 million decline in our provision for income taxes. the lower income tax provision for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by lower pretax income and a decline in our reported effective tax rate of 70 basis points. net income per diluted share declined by $3.26 to $4.62 per share in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to lower net income, partially offset by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during fiscal 2016. our operating results during fiscal 2016 included $142 million of pretax charges recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan, $48 million of other charges primarily related to a pending customs audit and the settlement of certain litigation claims, and $22 million of other non-cash impairment charges related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure, which together had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $150 million, or approximately $1.74 per diluted share. partially offsetting these charges was the favorable impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, which increased net income by $8 million, or approximately $0.10 per diluted share. net income per diluted share also included unfavorable foreign currency impacts of approximately $1.10 per diluted share in fiscal 2016.
financial condition and liquidity we ended fiscal 2016 in a net cash and investments position (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt) of $559 million, compared to $620 million as of the end of fiscal 2015. the decline in our net cash and investments position was primarily due to our use of cash to support class a common stock repurchases of $500 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $418 million of capital expenditures, and to make cash dividend payments of $170 million, partially offset by our operating cash flows of $1.007 billion during fiscal 2016.
we generated $1.007 billion of cash from operations during fiscal 2016, compared to $894 million during fiscal 2015. the increase in our operating cash flows was primarily due to a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, partially offset by a decline in net income before non-cash charges during fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year.
our equity declined to $3.744 billion as of april 2, 2016, compared to $3.891 billion as of march 28, 2015, primarily due to our class a common stock repurchases and dividends declared, partially offset by our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements during fiscal 2016.
recent developments global reorganization plan on may 12, 2015, our board of directors approved a reorganization and restructuring plan comprised of the following major actions: (i) the reorganization of the company from its historical channel and regional structure to an integrated global brand-based operating structure, which will streamline our business processes to better align our cost structure with our long-term growth strategy; (ii) a strategic store and shop-within-shop performance review conducted by region and brand; (iii) a targeted corporate functional area review; and (iv) the consolidation of certain of our luxury lines (collectively, the "global reorganization plan"). the global reorganization plan has resulted in a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain stores and shop-within-shops. actions associated with the global reorganization plan were substantially completed during fiscal 2016 and are expected to result in improved operational efficiencies by reducing annual operating expenses by approximately $125 million.
in connection with the global reorganization plan, we recorded total charges of $142 million during fiscal 2016 (see notes 10 and 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) and expect to incur additional charges of approximately $5 million during fiscal 2017.
in addition, we continue to develop and work towards finalizing our strategic growth plan for fiscal 2017 and beyond, which once completed will likely result in additional restructuring activities and related charges.

transactions and trends affecting comparability of results of operations and financial condition the comparability of our operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain events, including:
•   pretax asset impairment and restructuring and other charges recorded during the periods presented. a summary of the effect of these items on pretax income for each fiscal year is summarized below (references to "notes" are to the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements):

restructuring and other charges (see note 11)   (143      )        (10         )         (18         )
in addition to the charges presented above, we also incurred inventory-related charges of $20 million in connection with the global reorganization plan during fiscal 2016, which were recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income (see note 11).
•   the inclusion of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $72 million and net income of $8 million, or approximately $0.10 per diluted share.
•   our acquisitions of previously licensed businesses, including the transition of the ralph lauren-branded apparel and accessories business in australia and new zealand (the "australia and new zealand business") from a licensed to a wholly-owned operation (the "australia and new zealand licensed operations acquisition") in july 2013; and the transition of the north american chaps-branded men's sportswear business (the "chaps menswear business") from a licensed to a wholly-owned operation (the "chaps menswear license acquisition") in april 2013, which resulted in a $16 million gain recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
since we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in u.s. dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the u.s. dollar. these rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. as such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("u.s. gaap"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating the current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. we present constant currency financial information, which is a non-u.s. gaap financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. we use constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our businesses. the constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with u.s. gaap. reconciliations between this non-u.s. gaap financial measure and the most directly comparable u.s. gaap measure are included in the "results of operations" section where applicable.
our "results of operations" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting comparability. however, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. accordingly, investors and other financial statement users should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends.

wholesale net revenues - net revenues decreased by $198 million, or 5.7%, during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, inclusive of the favorable impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $10 million on a reported basis. the decrease also included net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $105 million, primarily related to the weakening of the euro and the canadian dollar against the u.s. dollar. on a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $93 million, or 2.7%.
the $198 million net decline in wholesale net revenues was driven by:
•   a $156 million, or 5.8%, net decrease related to our business in the americas, reflecting lower sales across all of our major apparel and accessories businesses, due in part to a decline in foreign tourist traffic in major metropolitan locations, which contributed to a more competitive retail environment. the net decrease related to our business in the americas also reflected net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $14 million due to the weakening of the canadian dollar against the u.s. dollar; and
•   a $33 million, or 4.6%, net decrease related to our european business, reflecting net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $86 million, partially offset by increased sales across all of our major apparel and accessories businesses. on a constant currency basis, net revenues related to our european business increased by $53 million, or 7.3%.
retail net revenues - net revenues decreased by $23 million, or 0.6%, during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, inclusive of the favorable impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $62 million on a reported basis. the decrease also included net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $168 million, primarily related to the weakening of the euro, the japanese yen, the canadian dollar, and the korean won against the u.s. dollar. on a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $145 million, or 3.7%.
the $23 million net decline in retail net revenues was driven by:
•   a $220 million, or 7%, net decline in consolidated comparable store sales, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $123 million. our total comparable store sales decreased by $97 million, or 3%, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by lower sales from certain retail stores, partially offset by an increase from our ralph lauren e-commerce operations. comparable store sales related to our e-commerce operations increased by approximately 2% on a reported basis and 3% on a constant currency basis over the related prior period, and had a favorable impact on our total comparable store sales of approximately 1% to 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. our consolidated comparable store sales excluding e-commerce declined by approximately 8% to 9% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% on a constant currency basis. all comparable store sales metrics were calculated on a 52-week basis.
comparable store sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for at least one full fiscal year. sales for stores that are closed during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least one full fiscal year. sales from our e-commerce sites are included within comparable store sales for those geographies that have been serviced by the related site for at least one full fiscal year. consolidated comparable store sales information includes our ralph lauren stores (including concession-based shop-within-shops), factory stores, club monaco stores and e-commerce sites, and certain ralph lauren e-commerce sites. we use an integrated omni-channel strategy to operate our retail business, in which our e-commerce operations are interdependent with our physical stores.

this decline was partially offset by:
•   a $197 million, or 28%, net increase in non-comparable store sales, inclusive of the favorable impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, which resulted in incremental net revenues of $62 million on a reported basis. the increase also included net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $45 million. on a constant currency basis, non-comparable store sales increased by $242 million, or 34%, primarily driven by new global store openings and the expansion of our e-commerce operations within the past twelve months, which more than offset the impact of store closings.
our global average store count increased by 91 stores and concession shops during fiscal 2016 compared with the prior fiscal year, due to new global store openings, primarily in asia, partially offset by store closures. the following table details our retail store presence as of the periods presented:

in addition to our stores, our retail segment sells products online through our e-commerce channel, which includes:
•   our north american e-commerce sites located at www.ralphlauren.com and www.clubmonaco.com, as well as our club monaco site in canada located at www.clubmonaco.ca;
•   our ralph lauren e-commerce sites in europe, including www.ralphlauren.co.uk, www.ralphlauren.fr, and www.ralphlauren.de; and

licensing revenues - net revenues increased by $6 million, or 3.7%, during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $2 million, primarily related to the weakening of the euro and the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar. on a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $8 million, or 5.0%.
gross profit.    gross profit decreased by $191 million, or 4.4%, to $4.187 billion in fiscal 2016 from $4.378 billion in fiscal 2015. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues declined by 100 basis points to 56.5% in fiscal 2016 from 57.5% in fiscal 2015. this decline was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency effects and certain non-cash charges recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan, partially offset by increased profitability largely attributable to favorable channel mix.
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. these factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.
selling, general, and administrative expenses.    sg&a expenses primarily include compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, distribution, bad debt, information technology, facilities, legal, and other costs associated with finance and administration. sg&a expenses increased by $88 million, or 2.7%, to $3.389 billion in fiscal 2016 from $3.301 billion in fiscal 2015. this increase included a net favorable foreign currency effect of $110 million, primarily related to the weakening of the euro, the japanese yen, and the korean won against the u.s. dollar. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 45.8% in fiscal 2016 from 43.3% in fiscal 2015. the 250 basis point increase was primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues due in part to unfavorable foreign currency effects, as previously discussed, and an increase in operating expenses in support of the continued investment in, and expansion of, our retail businesses (which typically carry higher operating expense margins) through new store and concession shop openings (as previously discussed); increased investments in our facilities and infrastructure; increased advertising and marketing costs; and investments in new business initiatives. these increases were partially offset by our operational discipline and savings associated with our restructuring activities.

total change in sg&amp;a expenses                             $88
during fiscal 2017, we continue to expect a certain amount of operating expense deleverage due to foreign exchange rate volatility and continued investment in our long-term strategic growth initiatives, including expansion of the polo-branded store concept around the world, retail store expansion, department store renovations, and continued investment in our infrastructure, partially offset by anticipated cost savings related to our restructuring activities (see "recent developments").
amortization of intangible assets.    amortization of intangible assets decreased by $1 million, or 6.2%, to $24 million in fiscal 2016 from $25 million in fiscal 2015. this decrease reflected the absence of expense in the current fiscal year for certain customer relationship intangible assets that were fully amortized as of the end of fiscal 2015.
impairment of assets.  during fiscal 2016, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $49 million to write off certain fixed assets related to our domestic and international stores and shop-within-shops, of which $27 million was recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan and $22 million was recorded in connection with underperforming stores subject to potential future closure. during fiscal 2015, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $7 million, primarily to write off certain fixed assets related to domestic and international retail stores (see note 10 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
restructuring and other charges.  during fiscal 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $95 million in connection with the global reorganization plan, consisting of severance and benefit costs, lease termination and store closure costs, other cash charges, and non-cash accelerated stock-based compensation expense. in addition, during fiscal 2016, we recorded other charges of $48 million primarily related to a pending customs audit and the settlement of certain litigation claims. during fiscal 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $10 million, primarily related to severance and benefit costs associated with certain of our retail, wholesale, and corporate operations. (see note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
operating income.    operating income decreased by $453 million, or 43.8%, to $582 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.035 billion in fiscal 2015. this decrease included $142 million of charges recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan, $48 million of other charges primarily related to a pending customs audit and the settlement of certain litigation claims, and $22 million of other non-cash impairment charges related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure, all as previously discussed. this decrease also included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $112 million, primarily related to the weakening of the euro, the japanese yen, and the canadian dollar against the u.s. dollar. operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased 570 basis points, to 7.9% in fiscal 2016 from 13.6% in fiscal 2015. the overall decline in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the decrease in our gross profit margin and the increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues, both of which are inclusive of unfavorable foreign currency effects, as well as the increase in restructuring and other charges and impairment of assets, all as previously discussed.

wholesale operating margin declined by 210 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 130 basis points related to decreased profitability in our core wholesale businesses, largely driven by the impact of a more competitive domestic retail environment and an increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by improved performance of certain of our international operations. the remaining decline in wholesale operating margin was primarily attributable to net unfavorable foreign currency effects of 60 basis points, as well as a 20 basis point decline attributable to non-cash charges recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan.
retail operating margin declined by 420 basis points, primarily due to a 160 basis point decline attributable to non-cash charges largely recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan and unfavorable foreign currency effects of 110 basis points. the remaining 150 basis point decline in retail operating margin was primarily attributable to decreased profitability in our core retail businesses, largely driven by an increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
licensing operating margin declined by 170 basis points, primarily due to an increase in sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
unallocated corporate expenses increased by $34 million, primarily due to higher compensation-related costs of $33 million, due in part to the introduction of new vesting provisions for certain stock-based compensation awards granted to retirement-eligible employees beginning in fiscal 2016 (see note 19 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements), and higher consulting fees of $27 million. these increases were partially offset by a decline in other operating expenses of $26 million due in part to operational discipline.
unallocated restructuring and other charges increased by $133 million to $143 million in fiscal 2016 from $10 million in fiscal 2015, as previously described (see note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
non-operating expense, net.    non-operating expense, net is comprised of net foreign currency gains (losses), interest expense, interest and other income, net, and equity in losses from our equity-method investees. non-operating expense, net decreased by $18 million to $30 million in fiscal 2016 from $48 million in fiscal 2015. the decline in non-operating expense, net was primarily attributable to lower foreign currency losses of $22 million, largely related to the net favorable revaluation and settlement of foreign currency-denominated intercompany receivables and payables, inclusive of the impact of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, as compared to the prior fiscal year (foreign currency gains (losses) do not result from the translation of the operating results of our foreign subsidiaries to u.s. dollars). this decrease was partially offset by higher interest expense of $4 million, primarily attributable to the 2.625% unsecured senior notes issued in august 2015.
provision for income taxes.    the provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. the provision for income taxes decreased by $129 million, or 45.5%, to $156 million in fiscal 2016 from $285 million in fiscal 2015. the decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the decline in pretax income, coupled with a decrease in our reported effective tax rate of 70 basis points to 28.2% in fiscal 2016 from 28.9% in fiscal 2015. the lower effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to income tax benefits resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations, a change to the assessment period associated with certain tax liabilities, and provision to tax return adjustments, partially offset by the reversal of certain deferred tax assets that were determined to not be realizable and the absence of tax benefits derived from the legal entity

restructuring of certain of our foreign operations during fiscal 2015. the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, and certain nondeductible expenses. our effective tax rate will change from period to period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies.
net income.    net income declined by $306 million, or 43.6%, to $396 million in fiscal 2016 from $702 million in fiscal 2015. the decline in net income was primarily due to the $453 million decline in operating income, partially offset by the $129 million reduction in our provision for income taxes, as previously discussed. our operating results during fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by $142 million of pretax charges recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan, $48 million of other charges primarily related to a pending customs audit and the settlement of certain litigation claims, and $22 million of other non-cash impairment charges related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure, which together had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $150 million. partially offsetting these charges was the favorable impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, which increased net income by $8 million. net income also included unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $94 million during fiscal 2016.
net income per diluted share.    net income per diluted share declined by $3.26, or 41.4%, to $4.62 per share in fiscal 2016 from $7.88 per share in fiscal 2015. the decline was due to lower net income, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during fiscal 2016, driven by our share repurchases over the last twelve months. net income per diluted share for fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by approximately $1.74 per share as a result of charges recorded in connection with the global reorganization plan, other charges primarily related to a pending customs audit and the settlement of certain litigation claims, and other non-cash impairment charges related to underperforming stores subject to potential future closure, and favorably impacted by approximately $0.10 per share as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, all as previously discussed. net income per diluted share also included unfavorable foreign currency impacts of approximately $1.10 per share during fiscal 2016.

wholesale net revenues - net revenues increased by $9 million, or 0.3%, during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $63 million, primarily related to the weakening of the euro, the canadian dollar, and the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar. on a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $72 million, or 2.1%.
the $9 million net increase in wholesale net revenues was driven by:
•   a $28 million net increase related to our business in the americas, reflecting increased revenues from our womenswear and accessories businesses, partially offset by decreased revenues from our menswear business, due in part to higher prior period sales associated with the initial transition of the chaps menswear business to a wholly-owned operation. the net increase related to our business in the americas also reflected net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $9 million due to the weakening of the canadian dollar against the u.s. dollar.
this net increase was partially offset by:
•   a $9 million net decrease related to our asia businesses, primarily reflecting net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $4 million largely related to the weakening of the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar, as well as the continued impact of our business model shift to the retail concession-based channel, partially offset by increased sales to our licensees; and
•   a $10 million net decrease related to our european business, primarily reflecting net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $50 million, partially offset by increased sales across all of our major apparel and accessories businesses.
retail net revenues - net revenues increased by $158 million, or 4.2%, during fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $65 million, primarily related to the weakening of the japanese yen and the euro against the u.s. dollar. on a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $223 million, or 5.9%.
the $158 million net increase in retail net revenues was driven by:
•   a $178 million, or a 23%, net increase in non-comparable store sales, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $17 million. on a constant currency basis, non-comparable store sales increased by $195 million, or 25%, primarily driven by new global store openings in asia and europe within the past twelve months, the expansion of our e-commerce operations, and new stores and concession shops assumed in connection with the australia and new zealand licensed operations acquisition, which more than offset the impact of store closings.
this net increase was partially offset by:
•   a $20 million, or 1%, net decline in consolidated comparable store sales, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $48 million. our total comparable store sales increased approximately $28 million, or 1%, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase from our ralph lauren e-commerce operations, partially offset by lower sales from certain retail stores and concession shops. comparable store sales related to our e-commerce operations increased by approximately 16% on a reported basis and 17% on a constant currency basis over the related prior fiscal year period, and had a favorable impact on our total comparable store sales of approximately 3% to 4% on a reported basis and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis. our consolidated comparable store sales excluding e-commerce declined between 3% and 4% on a reported basis and declined between 2% and 3% on a constant currency basis.

our global average store count increased by 36 stores and concession shops during fiscal 2015 compared with the prior fiscal year, due to new global store openings, primarily in asia, partially offset by store closures. the following table details our retail store and e-commerce presence as of the periods presented:

licensing revenues - net revenues increased by $3 million, or 1.8%, during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $3 million, primarily related to the weakening of the euro and the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar. on a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $6 million, or 3.3%.
the $3 million increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to increased apparel and accessories-related revenues and home licensing revenues, partially offset by the impact of the transition of the previously licensed australia and new zealand business to a wholly-owned operation.
gross profit.    gross profit increased by $68 million, or 1.6%, to $4.378 billion in fiscal 2015 from $4.310 billion in fiscal 2014. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased by 40 basis points to 57.5% in fiscal 2015 from 57.9% in fiscal 2014. this decline was primarily attributable to a more promotional retail environment and less favorable product mix, partially offset by a more favorable channel mix.
selling, general, and administrative expenses.    sg&a expenses increased by $159 million, or 5.0%, to $3.301 billion in fiscal 2015 from $3.142 billion in fiscal 2014. this increase included a net favorable foreign currency effect of $54 million, primarily related to the weakening of the euro and the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 43.3% in fiscal 2015 from 42.2% in fiscal 2014. the 110 basis point increase was primarily due to the increase in operating expenses in support of the growth of our retail businesses (which typically carry higher operating expense margins); increased investments in our facilities and infrastructure; increased advertising and marketing costs; incremental operating expenses attributable to our acquisition of the australia and new zealand business; and investments in new business initiatives. these increases were partially offset by our operating leverage on higher net revenues and operational discipline.

(a)   primarily due to increased salaries and related expenses to support our retail business growth.
(b)   comprised of acquisition-related costs for the chaps menswear license acquisition in april 2013 and for the australia and new zealand licensed operations acquisition in july 2013 (see note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
amortization of intangible assets.    amortization of intangible assets decreased by $10 million, or 27.9%, to $25 million in fiscal 2015 from $35 million in fiscal 2014. this decrease was primarily related to the licensed trademark intangible asset acquired in april 2013 in connection with the chaps menswear license acquisition, which was fully amortized in fiscal 2014 (see note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
gain on acquisition of chaps. during fiscal 2014, we recorded a $16 million gain on the chaps menswear license acquisition, representing the difference between the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired and the contractually-defined purchase price under our license agreement with warnaco, which granted us the right to early-terminate the license upon pvh's acquisition of warnaco in february 2013 (see note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
impairment of assets.  during fiscal 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $7 million, primarily to write off certain fixed assets related to our domestic and international retail stores. during fiscal 2014, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1 million to write off certain long-lived assets related to our european operations (see note 10 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
restructuring and other charges.  restructuring and other charges declined by $8 million to $10 million in fiscal 2015 from $18 million in fiscal 2014. during fiscal 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $10 million, primarily related to severance and benefit costs associated with certain of our retail, wholesale, and corporate operations. during fiscal 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $8 million, primarily related to severance and benefit costs associated with our corporate operations. in addition, during fiscal 2014, we recorded $10 million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense associated with certain new executive employment agreement provisions (see note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
operating income.    operating income decreased by $95 million, or 8.4%, to $1.035 billion in fiscal 2015 from $1.130 billion in fiscal 2014. operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased 160 basis points, to 13.6% in fiscal 2015 from 15.2% in fiscal 2014. the overall decline in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the increase in sg&a as a percentage of net revenues and the absence of the prior year gain on the chaps menswear license acquisition, as well as a lower gross profit margin, as previously discussed.

wholesale operating margin declined by 60 basis points, primarily attributable to net unfavorable foreign currency effects. operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues was flat in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior fiscal year.
retail operating margin declined by 180 basis points, primarily attributable to a 60 basis point increase in compensation-related expenses and a 50 basis point increase in depreciation expense, both primarily associated with our global store development efforts and new store openings, a 20 basis point increase in advertising and marketing expenses, and a 10 basis point increase in other operating expenses. the decline in the retail operating margin also reflected a 40 basis point decrease due to other factors, including lower profitability from our existing retail operations, reflecting the impact of a more promotional retail environment, as previously discussed.
licensing operating margin increased by 20 basis points, primarily due to our operating leverage on higher revenues.
unallocated corporate expenses increased by $24 million, primarily due to higher compensation-related costs of $18 million, higher depreciation expense of $17 million largely due to the increased investment in our infrastructure, higher rent and occupancy expenses of $5 million, and higher corporate advertising and marketing costs of $3 million. these increases were partially offset by lower amortization expense of $9 million, the non-recurrence of prior year acquisition-related costs of $7 million, and a decline in other operating expenses of $3 million.
gain on acquisition of chaps was $16 million for fiscal 2014, as previously described and in note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.
unallocated restructuring and other charges declined by $8 million to $10 million in fiscal 2015 from $18 million in fiscal 2014, as previously described (see note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
non-operating expense, net.    non-operating expense, net increased by $14 million to $48 million in fiscal 2015 from $34 million in fiscal 2014. the higher non-operating expense, net was primarily attributed to (i) higher foreign currency losses, primarily related to the revaluation and settlement of foreign currency-denominated third-party and intercompany receivables and payables attributable to the weakening of the japanese yen, the euro, and the canadian dollar against the u.s. dollar, partially offset by gains recognized on forward foreign currency exchange contracts, and (ii) additional equity in losses from our equity-method investment in the ralph lauren watch and jewelry company, sárl (the "rl watch company"). these increases were partially offset by (i) higher interest and other income, net, primarily due to the increased balance of our investment portfolio, and (ii) lower interest expense associated with our current borrowings, including the 2.125% unsecured senior notes issued in september 2013 and commercial paper notes, as compared to the 4.5% interest rate on the euro-denominated notes, which were repaid in october 2013 (see note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements).
provision for income taxes.    the provision for income taxes decreased by $35 million, or 11.0%, to $285 million in fiscal 2015 from $320 million in fiscal 2014. the decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the decline in pretax income, coupled with a decrease in our reported effective tax rate of 30 basis points to 28.9% in fiscal 2015 from 29.2% in fiscal 2014. the lower effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a greater proportion of earnings generated in lower-taxed
49
jurisdictions, as well as an income tax benefit resulting from the legal entity restructuring of certain of our foreign operations in fiscal 2015, partially offset by additional tax reserves associated with the conclusion of tax examinations during fiscal 2015 and the absence of prior-year tax reserve reductions associated with the conclusion of a tax examination.
net income.    net income declined by $74 million, or 9.5%, to $702 million in fiscal 2015 from $776 million in fiscal 2014. the decline in net income was primarily due to the $95 million decline in operating income and higher foreign currency losses of $18 million, partially offset by the $35 million reduction in our provision for income taxes, all as previously discussed.
net income per diluted share.    net income per diluted share declined by $0.55, or 6.5%, to $7.88 per share in fiscal 2015 from $8.43 per share in fiscal 2014. the decline was due to lower net income, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during fiscal 2015, driven by our share repurchases during fiscal 2015.

(c)   "net cash and investments" is defined as cash and cash equivalents, plus short-term and non-current investments, less total debt.
the decline in our net cash and investments position at april 2, 2016 as compared to march 28, 2015 was primarily due to our use of cash to support our class a common stock repurchases of $500 million, including withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards, to invest in our business through $418 million in capital expenditures, and to make cash dividend payments of $170 million during fiscal 2016, partially offset by our operating cash flows of $1.007 billion.
the decline in equity was attributable to our share repurchase activity and dividends declared, partially offset by our comprehensive income and the net impact of stock-based compensation arrangements during fiscal 2016.

net cash provided by operating activities.    net cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.007 billion during fiscal 2016, from $894 million during fiscal 2015. the $113 million net increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, partially offset by a decline in net income before non-cash charges. the net favorable change related to our working capital was primarily driven by:
•   a favorable change in our accounts receivable balance, largely driven by lower net revenues at the end of fiscal 2016 and the timing of cash collections; and
•   favorable changes in our (i) prepaid expenses and other current assets and (ii) accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances, both largely driven by the timing of payments.
net cash used in investing activities.    net cash used in investing activities was $583 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to $689 million during fiscal 2015. the $106 million net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a $142 million decline in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. during fiscal 2016, we made net investment purchases of $143 million, as compared to net investment purchases of $285 million during fiscal 2015.
the above decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $27 million increase in capital expenditures. during fiscal 2016, we spent $418 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $391 million during fiscal 2015. our capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 primarily related to our global retail store expansion, department store renovations, enhancements to our global information technology systems, and further development of our infrastructure, including the build-out of a new distribution center in high point, north carolina.
in fiscal 2017, we expect to spend approximately $400 million in capital expenditures, primarily to support our global retail store expansion and further development of our infrastructure, including continued investment in a new global e-commerce platform. our capital expenditures will also be focused on department store renovations and the continued implementation of sap and other systems.
net cash used in financing activities.    net cash used in financing activities was $473 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to $421 million during fiscal 2015. the $52 million increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:
•   a $54 million decrease in proceeds from debt issuances, less cash used to repay debt. during fiscal 2016, we received net proceeds of $299 million from our issuance of 2.625% unsecured senior notes in august 2015 and $26 million in borrowings under our credit facilities, which were partially offset by net repayments of $145 million related to our commercial paper note issuances and repayments. during fiscal 2015, we received net proceeds of $234 million related to our commercial paper note issuances and repayments; and
•   a $12 million increase in cash used to pay dividends, primarily due to an increase in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.45 per share to $0.50 per share effective beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. during fiscal 2016, we used $170 million to pay dividends, as compared to $158 million during fiscal 2015.
51
these increases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by:
•   a $32 million decrease in cash used to repurchase shares of our class a common stock. during fiscal 2016, we used $480 million to repurchase shares of class a common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $20 million in shares of class a common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. on a comparative basis, during fiscal 2015, we used $500 million to repurchase shares of class a common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $32 million in shares of class a common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes.

net cash provided by operating activities.    net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $894 million during fiscal 2015, from $907 million during fiscal 2014. the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the decline in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities. the net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities was driven by foreign currency impacts, primarily related to the weakening of the euro and the japanese yen against the u.s. dollar during fiscal 2015, partially offset by a decline in our working capital driven by:
•   unfavorable changes in income tax receivables and payables, as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets, both due to the timing of payments; and
•   a year-over-year increase in our inventory levels to support our new brands and new and expanded stores.
net cash used in investing activities.    net cash used in investing activities was $689 million during fiscal 2015, as compared to $488 million during fiscal 2014. the $201 million net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a $229 million increase in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. during fiscal 2015, we made net purchases of investments of $285 million, as compared to net purchases of investments of $56 million during fiscal 2014.
the above increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $28 million decline in cash used to fund acquisitions and ventures. during fiscal 2015, we used $12 million of cash to support the funding of our joint venture, the rl watch company, and other investments. during fiscal 2014, we used $40 million of cash, including $18 million to fund the chaps menswear license acquisition, $15 million to fund the australia and new zealand licensed operations acquisition, as well as amounts to support the continued funding of the rl watch company.
net cash used in financing activities.    net cash used in financing activities was $421 million during fiscal 2015, as compared to $599 million during fiscal 2014. the $178 million decline in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:
•   a $203 million increase in proceeds from debt issuances, less cash used to repay debt. during fiscal 2015, we received net proceeds of $234 million from commercial paper note issuances and repayments. during fiscal 2014, we received $300 million in proceeds from our issuance of 2.125% unsecured senior notes in september 2013, a portion of which was used to repay the $269 million principal amount outstanding of the 4.5% euro-denominated notes upon their maturity on october 4, 2013; and
52
•   a $26 million decline in cash used to repurchase shares of our class a common stock. during fiscal 2015, we used $500 million to repurchase shares of class a common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $32 million in shares of class a common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. on a comparative basis, during fiscal 2014, we used $498 million to repurchase shares of class a common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $60 million in shares of class a common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes.
the above decreases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by:
•   a $26 million decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements;
•   a $15 million increase in payments related to our capital lease obligations; and
•   a $9 million increase in cash used to pay dividends.
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, availability under our credit facilities, our issuances of commercial paper notes, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, and other available financing options.
during fiscal 2016, we generated $1.007 billion of net cash flows from our operations. as of april 2, 2016, we had $1.085 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $1.066 billion were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the u.s. we are not dependent on foreign cash to fund our domestic operations and do not expect to repatriate these balances to meet our domestic cash needs. however, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate any funds to the u.s. in the future, we would be subject to applicable u.s. and foreign taxes.
the following table presents our total availability, borrowings outstanding, and remaining availability under our credit facilities and commercial paper program as of april 2, 2016:

(c)   classified as short-term debt within the consolidated balance sheet.
(d)   as of april 2, 2016, we were contingently liable for $9 million of outstanding letters of credit under the global credit facility.
we believe that our global credit facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. in particular, as of april 2, 2016, there were nine financial institutions participating in the global credit facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 20%. borrowings under the pan-asia credit facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating regional branches of jpmorgan chase (the "banks"), subject to availability of the banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. we have no reason to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the global credit facility and the pan-asia credit facilities in the event of our election to draw funds in the foreseeable future.

our sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and e-commerce development and expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, payment of dividends, debt repayments, common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and other corporate activities, including our restructuring actions. we believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and our ability to access capital markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing development of our businesses, and our plans for further business expansion.
see note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our credit facilities.
common stock repurchase program as of april 2, 2016, the remaining availability under our class a common stock repurchase program was approximately $100 million. on may 11, 2016, our board of directors approved an expansion of the program that allows us to repurchase up to an additional $200 million of class a common stock. repurchases of shares of class a common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions.
see note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our class a common stock repurchase program.
dividends since 2003, we have maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock. on november 5, 2013, our board of directors approved an increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.40 per share to $0.45 per share. on february 3, 2015, our board of directors approved a further increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.45 per share to $0.50 per share.
we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on our outstanding common stock. however, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant.
see note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our quarterly cash dividend program.
debt and covenant compliance in september 2013, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due september 26, 2018, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.125%, payable semi-annually (the "2.125% senior notes"). in august 2015, we completed a second registered public debt offering and issued an additional $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due august 18, 2020, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.625%, payable semi-annually (the "2.625% senior notes").
the indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 2.125% senior notes and 2.625% senior notes (as supplemented, the "indenture") contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. however, the indenture does not contain any financial covenants.
the global credit facility contains a number of covenants, as described in note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. as of april 2, 2016, no event of default (as such term is defined pursuant to the global credit facility) has occurred under our global credit facility. the pan-asia credit facilities do not contain any financial covenants.
see note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our debt and covenant compliance.

contractual and other obligations firm commitments the following table summarizes certain of our aggregate contractual obligations as of april 2, 2016, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. we expect to fund these firm commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, through availability under our credit facilities or other accessible sources of financing.

the following is a description of our material, firmly committed obligations as of april 2, 2016:
•   senior notes represents the principal amount of our outstanding 2.125% senior notes and 2.625% senior notes. amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);
•   interest payments on senior notes represent the semi-annual contractual interest payments due on our 2.125% senior notes and 2.625% senior notes;
•   lease obligations represent the minimum lease rental payments due under noncancelable leases for our real estate and operating equipment. in addition to such amounts, we are normally required to pay taxes, insurance, and certain occupancy costs relating to our leased real estate properties, which are not included in the table above. approximately 70% of these lease obligations relate to our retail operations. information has been presented separately for capital and operating leases;
•   inventory purchase commitments represent our legally-binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices; and
•   other commitments primarily represent our legally-binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising agreements; distribution-related agreements; information technology-related service agreements; and pension-related obligations.
excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $81 million as of april 2, 2016, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. the above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts recorded in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of april 2, 2016, including borrowings outstanding of $90 million and $26 million under our commercial paper program and pan-asia credit facilities, respectively, which will be paid within one year; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue), or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a "purchase obligation" as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items).
we also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain events or circumstances occur. see note 16 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table.
55
off-balance sheet arrangements in addition to the commitments included in the above table, our other off-balance sheet firm commitments relating to our outstanding letters of credit amounted to approximately $10 million as of april 2, 2016. we do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.
market risk management as discussed in note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows from our international operations, and possible declines in the value of reported net assets of certain of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt relating to changes in interest rates. consequently, at times, in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to manage such risks. we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.
as a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to our contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate this counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. our established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk from derivative transactions include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. we also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to mitigate credit risk associated with our derivative instruments. as a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of april 2, 2016. however, we do have in aggregate approximately $11 million of derivative instruments in net asset positions with two creditworthy financial institutions.
foreign currency risk management we manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts. refer to note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of april 2, 2016.
forward foreign currency exchange contracts we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as hedges to reduce our risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, intercompany royalty payments made by certain of our international operations, and other foreign currency-denominated operational and intercompany balances and cash flows. as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of the euro, the japanese yen, the south korean won, the australian dollar, the canadian dollar, the british pound sterling, and the hong kong dollar, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures anticipated over a two-year period. in doing so, we use forward foreign currency exchange contracts that generally have maturities of two months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period.
our foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by our company's established policies and procedures. these policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. our policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including, but not limited to, authorization levels, transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. we monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques, including a periodic review of market values and sensitivity analyses.
we record our forward foreign currency exchange contracts at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. to the extent forward foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged item, the related gains or losses are initially deferred in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") and are subsequently recognized in our consolidated statements of income as follows:
•   forecasted inventory transactions - recognized as part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold to a third party.
56
•   intercompany royalties - recognized within foreign currency gains (losses) generally in the period in which the related payments being hedged occur.
we recognized net gains on forward foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of approximately $32 million, $35 million, and $30 million during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014, respectively.
cross-currency swap contracts during fiscal 2016, we entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-floating rate cross-currency swaps, with notional amounts of €280 million and €274 million, which we designated as hedges of our net investment in certain of our european subsidiaries (the "cross-currency swaps"). the cross-currency swaps, which mature on september 26, 2018 and august 18, 2020, respectively, swap the u.s. dollar-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a fixed spread for euro-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the 3-month euro interbank offered rate plus a fixed spread. as a result, the cross-currency swaps, in conjunction with the interest rate swaps (as defined below), economically convert our $300 million fixed-rate 2.125% and $300 million fixed-rate 2.625% obligations to €280 million and €274 million floating-rate euro-denominated liabilities, respectively.
sensitivity we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. to perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. this analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the u.s. dollar. as of april 2, 2016, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the u.s. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in a net increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $155 million. as our outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts are primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, and as our cross-currency swap contracts are designated as hedges of our net investment in certain of our european subsidiaries, this hypothetical net change in fair value would be largely offset by the net change in the fair values of the underlying hedged items.
interest rate risk management during fiscal 2016, we entered into two pay-floating rate, receive-fixed rate interest rate swap contracts which we designated as hedges against changes in the respective fair values of our fixed-rate 2.125% senior notes and our fixed-rate 2.625% senior notes attributed to changes in the benchmark interest rate (the "interest rate swaps"). the interest rate swaps, which mature on september 26, 2018 and august 18, 2020, respectively, both have notional amounts of $300 million and swap the fixed interest rates on our 2.125% senior notes and 2.625% senior notes for variable interest rates based on 3-month libor plus a fixed spread.
sensitivity as of april 2, 2016, notwithstanding the aforementioned interest rate swaps, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. as such, our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to a change in the fair value of our fixed-rate senior notes, commercial paper notes, and borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities. as of april 2, 2016, the fair values of our senior notes, commercial paper notes, and borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities were $614 million, $90 million, and $26 million, respectively. a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would decrease or increase, respectively, the aggregate fair value of our senior notes, commercial paper notes, and borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities by approximately $5 million. such potential increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt would only be relevant if we were to retire all or a portion of the debt prior to its maturity, and are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
investment risk management as of april 2, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $456 million, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts and invested in money market funds and time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less. our other significant investments included $629 million of short-term investments, consisting of time deposits and corporate bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days; $46 million of restricted cash placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees in connection with certain international tax matters; and $187 million of investments with maturities greater than one year, consisting of time deposits.
57
we actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed further below. our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. see note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of april 2, 2016.
we evaluate investments held in unrealized loss positions, if any, for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. this evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. we consider the following factors: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time to maturity, (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and market forecasts, (v) our intent and ability to retain our investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value, and (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell our investment before recovery of market value. no material realized or unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments or other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded in any of the fiscal years presented.
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. it is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. we believe that the following list represents our critical accounting policies. for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, see note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.
sales reserves and uncollectible accounts a significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income involves estimating sales reserves, which represent the portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. in particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, and operational chargebacks. retail revenue, including e-commerce sales, is also reduced by an estimate of returns.
in determining estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, and operational chargebacks, we analyze historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, and retailer performance. we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis. our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. a hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, and operational chargebacks as of april 2, 2016 would have decreased our fiscal 2016 net revenues by approximately $2 million.
similarly, we evaluate our accounts receivable balances to determine if they will ultimately be collected. significant judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category. based on this information, we provide a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. although we believe that we have adequately provided for those risks as part of our bad debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on our major customers' business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows, and/or financial condition.
see "accounts receivable" in note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented.
inventories we hold inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores. we also hold retail inventory that is sold in our own stores and e-commerce sites directly to consumers. substantially all of our inventories are comprised of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost primarily determined on a weighted-average cost basis.
58
the estimated net realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through our factory stores, among other liquidation channels. estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and market conditions. reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. our historical estimates of these costs and the related provisions have not differed materially from actual results.
a hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our inventory reserves as of april 2, 2016 would have decreased our fiscal 2016 gross profit by approximately $1 million.
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable.
we generally perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. however, in order to reassess the fair values of our reporting units, we periodically perform a quantitative impairment analysis in lieu of using the qualitative approach.
performance of the qualitative assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair values of our reporting units. this requires consideration and assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. we also give consideration to the difference between each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date that a fair value measurement was performed. if the results of the qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed.
the quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. the first step is to identify the existence of potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. however, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. if the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test and determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. similarly, estimates and assumptions are used when determining the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. to assist management in the process of determining any potential goodwill impairment, we may review and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms. estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons, and recent transactions. these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and determination of appropriate market comparables.
we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2016 using the qualitative approach discussed above, while giving consideration to our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test (the results of which indicated that the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values). based on the results of the qualitative impairment assessment performed, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment. additionally, no goodwill impairment charges have been recorded during any of the three fiscal years presented.
59
in evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition where probable. to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions.
it is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) our businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions, (iii) business conditions or strategies change from our current assumptions, or (iv) the identification of our reporting units change, among other factors. such changes could result in a future impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
impairment of other long-lived assets property and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. in evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.
in determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.
during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, and fiscal 2014, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $49 million, $7 million, and $1 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets, primarily in our retail segment, to their estimated fair values. see note 10 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
income taxes in determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. if we consider that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. we measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. these assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. to the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. if the initial assessment of a position fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we will recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, which typically involves the use of significant estimates. such allowances are adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances.
see note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.
60
contingencies we are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain litigation, alleged information system security breaches, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. we record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. in addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. management considers many factors in making these assessments. as the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. as a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions.
stock-based compensation we expense all stock-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.
stock options stock options are granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our class a common stock on the date of grant. we use the black-scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, which requires the use of both subjective and objective assumptions. certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. the key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate, among others. generally, once stock option values are determined, accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual results.
no stock options were granted in fiscal 2016. see note 19 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
restricted stock and restricted stock units ("rsus")
we grant restricted shares of our class a common stock to our non-employee directors, and service-based rsus to certain of our senior executives, as well as certain of our other employees. in addition, we grant performance-based rsus to such senior executives and other key executives, as well as certain of our other employees. the fair values of restricted stock shares and rsus are based on the fair value of our unrestricted class a common stock, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for those restricted securities that are not entitled to dividend equivalents prior to vesting. compensation expense for performance-based rsus is recognized over the employees' requisite service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable, which involves judgment as to achievement of certain performance metrics.
our performance-based rsu awards with a market condition in the form of a total shareholder return ("tsr") modifier are valued based on the expected attainment of performance at the end of a three-year performance period and tsr achieved relative to the s&p 500 index over the performance period. the fair value of these awards is estimated using a monte carlo simulation valuation model prepared by an independent third party. this pricing model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying each market condition stipulated in the terms of the award to estimate its grant date fair value. compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is updated for the company's expected net income performance level against the related goal at the end of each reporting period.
sensitivity the assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair values of stock-based compensation awards represent our best estimates. in addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. if actual results differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, if we change the assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value for future stock-based award grants, or if there are changes in market conditions, stock-based compensation expense and, therefore, our results of operations could be materially impacted. a hypothetical 10% change in our stock-based compensation expense would have affected our fiscal 2016 net income by approximately $6 million.

recently issued accounting standards see note 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued accounting standards which may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.

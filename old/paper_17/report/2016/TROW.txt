item 1a.   risk factors.
an investment in our common stock involves various risks, including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec. investors should carefully consider these risks, along with the other information contained in this report, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware, or which we currently consider immaterial. any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and value of our common stock.
risks relating to our business and the financial services industry.
our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control.
we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t. rowe price mutual funds distributed in the u.s. and other investment portfolios. our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management. we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios. among equity investments, there is a significant variation in fees earned from index-based funds and portfolios at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end. fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios, though not as widely as equity investments, with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and non-u.s. dollar denominated bonds at the high end. as a result, our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management, all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors, including:
•   investor mobility. our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time, on very short notice and without any significant penalty.
•   general market declines. a downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease, and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments, thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management.
•   investment performance. if the investment performance of our managed portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable third-party benchmarks, we could lose existing and potential customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management. institutional investors in particular consider changing investment advisers based upon poor relative investment performance. individual investors in contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance. prolonged periods of strong relative investment performance may result in capacity constraints within certain portfolios, which in turn may negatively impact our ability to achieve strong investment results in subsequent periods.
•   investing trends. changes in investing trends and, in particular, investor preference for passive or alternative investment portfolios, retirement savings trends, including the prevalence of defined contribution retirement plans and target date retirement products, may reduce interest in our funds and portfolios and may alter our mix of assets under management.
•   interest rate changes. investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates.
•   international exposure. our managed portfolios may have significant investments in international markets that are subject to risk of loss from political or diplomatic developments, government policies, civil unrest, currency fluctuations, and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership. international markets, particularly emerging markets, which are often smaller, may not have the liquidity of established markets, may lack established regulations, and may experience significantly more volatility than established markets.
•   tax regulation changes. changes in the status of tax deferred retirement plan investments and tax-free municipal bonds, the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates, and other individual and corporate tax rates and regulations could page  11
adversely affect investor behavior and may cause investors to view certain investment offerings less favorably and withdraw their investment assets, thereby decreasing the level of assets under our management.
a decrease in the value of assets under our management, or an adverse change in their composition, could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues. for any period in which revenues decline, net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues.
the performance of our money market funds and portfolios have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment.
our money market funds' and portfolios' performance or yield is dependent on the income earned from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund. when interest rates are at or near historic lows, the operating costs of the funds will become a greater portion of the portfolio's net income, thereby reducing the yield of the funds to very low levels. the interest rate environment experienced since the second half of 2009 until recently led us to voluntarily waive our advisory and other fees earned on our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain yields at or above 0% for fund investors. such actions have reduced our advisory fee income and net income. fee waivers have been reduced significantly in 2016, as interest rates have increased over the year. given the current interest rate environment, we expect that our fee waivers in 2017, if any, will not be significant. the actual amount of fees waived is dependent on a number of variables including, among others, changes in the net assets held by our money market funds, changes in market yields, changes in the expense levels of the funds, and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers. for further discussion of the fees we waived in the current period, management's expectation as to future fee waivers, and the net cash flows of our money market funds and trusts, please see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7, of this form 10-k.
a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice.
we provide investment advisory, distribution, and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements. investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements. the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60-days notice. if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us, we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.
we operate in an intensely competitive industry, which could cause a loss of customers and their assets, thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income.
we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions. many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets. some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer. we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered, investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services. some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees, which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds.
the market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive products. as a result, investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us. while we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for good active management.
if current or potential customers decide to move their assets to one of our competitors, we could face a significant decline in market share, assets under management, revenues, and net income. in the event that we were to decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures, revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted.
page  12
our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services.
our success depends on our highly skilled personnel, including our portfolio and fund managers, investment analysts, sales and client relationship personnel, and corporate officers, many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry. strong financial services professionals are in demand, and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees. our key employees do not have employment contracts, and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time. we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel. due to the global nature of our investment advisory business, our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest, organized crime or terrorism and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions. we have near- and long-term succession planning processes, including programs to develop our future leaders, which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent. however, in order to retain or replace our key personnel, we may be required to increase compensation, which would decrease net income. the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors. losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income, possibly materially.
our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse effect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions, fines, penalties, litigation, and a decrease in revenues.
operating risks include:
•   failure to properly perform or oversee fund or portfolio recordkeeping responsibilities, including portfolio accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, investment restrictions compliance, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders to comply with tax regulations;
•   failure to properly perform transfer agent and participant recordkeeping responsibilities, including transaction processing, supervision of staff, tax reporting, and record retention;
•   sales and marketing risks, including the intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of products and services in advertising materials, public relations information, or other external communications, and failure to properly calculate and present investment performance data accurately and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations; and
•   our reliance on third-party vendors who, now or in the future, may perform or support important parts of our operations as there can be no assurance that they will perform properly or that our processes and plans to transition or delegate these functions to others will be successful or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties.
any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income.
we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity, strong investment performance, and superior client services. our brand is a valuable intangible asset, but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or even impossible to remediate. regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation, even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed. additionally, we are subject to the risk that our employees or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures. any real or perceived conflict between our clients' interests and our own, as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information, may impair our reputation. any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel, and reduce the amount of assets under our management, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.
our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income.
our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses, which can vary significantly for many reasons, including:
•   expenses incurred in connection with our multi-year strategic plan to strengthen our long-term competitive position;
•   variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, stock-based awards, changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes, changes in our employee count and mix, competitive factors, and inflation;
page  13
•   changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses, including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the u.s. and further penetrating u.s. distribution channels;
•   expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development;
•   changes in the costs incurred for third-party vendors that perform certain administrative and operating services;
•   a future impairment of investments recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;
•   a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet;
•   unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad;
•   unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill; and
•   disruptions of third-party services such as communications, power, and mutual fund transfer agent, investment management, trading, and accounting systems.
under our agreements with the price funds, we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms. if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds, our operating results will be adversely affected. while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any of our sponsored investment products, any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income.
we have contracted with third-party financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios in the u.s. and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future.
these contracted third-party intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to, and in competition with, our investment offerings, and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios. it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships. in addition, some investors rely on third-party financial planners, registered investment advisers, and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio. these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client's needs. we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future. further, their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients' assets under our management. mergers, acquisitions, and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third-party intermediaries. the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income, possibly by material amounts.
natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations.
armed conflict, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, power failures, and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, and net income by:
•   decreasing investment valuations in, and returns on, the investment portfolios that we manage,
•   causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive,
•   incapacitating or inflicting losses of lives among our employees,
•   interrupting our business operations or those of critical service providers,
•   triggering technology delays or failures, and
•   requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage, replace our facilities, and restore our operations.
a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore, maryland region and in london, england. we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise, or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur. in addition, we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support, and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to page  14
perform in an adequate and timely manner. if we lose the availability of any associates, or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner, we may be unable to timely resume our business operations, which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management, lower revenues, and materially reduced net income.
our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio.
we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in sponsored investment portfolios. all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our non-operating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant other-than-temporary impairments in the case of our available-for-sale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to our sponsored investment portfolios that are consolidated, held as trading or accounted for under the equity method. in addition, related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments, including the impact of market conditions and interest rates, and the size of our corporate money market and longer-term mutual fund holdings. fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future.
we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position.
any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks, including additional demands on our staff; unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping, additional or new regulatory requirements, operating facilities and technologies, and new employees; adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired; and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction.
we own a 26% investment in uti asset management company ltd (uti), an indian asset management company, and we may consider non-controlling minority investments in other entities in the future. we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future.
we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations.
we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the u.s. and have an equity investment in uti. our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions. our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks:
•   difficulty in managing, operating, and marketing our international operations;
•   fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under our management, revenues, expenses, and assets in our u.s. dollar based financial statements; and
•   significant adverse changes in international legal and regulatory environments.
legal and regulatory risks.
compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and non-compliance could result in fines and penalties.
if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to criminal and civil liability, the suspension of our employees, fines, penalties, sanctions, injunctive relief, exclusion from certain markets, or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business. a regulatory proceeding, even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions, could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital. any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect our ability to conduct business, and decrease revenue and net income.
legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden, impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business, and cause a loss of, or impact the servicing of, our clients and fund shareholders.
our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to, and evolving interpretations of, existing regulations. new regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations; regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt. future changes could require us to modify or curtail page  15
our investment offerings and business operations, or impact our expenses and profitability. additionally, some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets, service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients.
potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include, without limitation, the following:
•   as part of the debate in washington, d.c. related to the economy and the u.s. deficit, there has been increasing focus on the framework of the u.s. retirement system. we could incur increased costs if new regulatory requirements are adopted since retirement plans are a significant part of our client base and other types of retirement accounts invest in our funds. in addition, changes to the current framework may impact our business in other ways. for example, proposals to reduce contributions to individual retirement accounts and defined contribution plans for certain individuals, as well as potential changes to defined benefit plans, may result in increased plan terminations and reduce our opportunity to manage and service retirement assets.
•   in april 2016, the u.s. department of labor finalized changes to definitions and rules related to fiduciaries. although there is some uncertainty about the rule and whether it will be withdrawn or modified, as currently written these changes will require modifications to how we interact with retirement customers and prospects, and may cause us to limit certain types of distribution or other business activities. the securities and exchange commission (sec) is considering its own fiduciary rule proposal. any such rule may also have an impact on our business activities.
•   the federal reserve board has adopted final regulations related to non-bank systemically important financial institutions (sifis), and other jurisdictions are contemplating similar regulation. it has been suggested that large mutual funds, particularly money market funds, should be designated as sifis. we do not believe that mutual funds should be deemed sifis. further, we do not believe sifi designation was intended for traditional asset management businesses. however, if any t. rowe price fund or t. rowe price affiliate is deemed a sifi, increased regulatory oversight would apply, which may include enhanced capital, liquidity, leverage, stress testing, resolution planning, and risk management requirements.
•   on july 23, 2014, the sec adopted additional reforms regulating money market funds that became effective in october 2016. the reforms require institutional non-government money market funds to operate with a floating net asset value (nav) and require all non-government money market funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain conditions. government and retail money market funds can continue using current pricing and accounting methods to seek to maintain a stable nav. these reforms could have a negative impact on the attractiveness of such funds to investors and also subject us to additional regulatory requirements and costs to comply with such requirements.
•   the commodity futures trading commission has adopted certain amendments to its rules that would limit the ability of mutual funds and certain other products we sponsor to use commodities, futures, swaps, and other derivatives without additional registration. if our use of these products on behalf of client accounts increases so as to require registration, we would be subject to additional regulatory requirements and costs associated with registration.
•   there has been increased global regulatory focus on the manner in which intermediaries are paid for distribution of mutual funds. changes to long-standing market practices related to fees or enhanced disclosure requirements may negatively impact sales of mutual funds by intermediaries, especially if such requirements are not applied to other investment products.
•   we remain subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection of data we maintain concerning our customers and employees. these requirements continue to evolve. for example, the european union has adopted changes, effective in may 2018, which will, among other things, significantly increase the potential penalties for non-compliance.
•   global regulations on otc derivatives are evolving, including new and proposed regulations under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and european market infrastructure regulation relating to central clearing counterparties, trade reporting, and repositories. in addition, the sec has adopted new regulations that will require mutual funds to adopt liquidity risk management programs with specific requirements for measuring and reporting the liquidity of fund holdings. it also has proposed regulations detailing new exposure limits and asset coverage requirements for investments in derivatives, as well as adopting derivatives risk management programs. there remains uncertainty related to various requirements under these regulations and the exact manner in which they will impact current trading strategies for our clients.
page  16
•   the revised markets in financial instruments directive (mifid ii directive) and regulation (mifir) (together "mifid ii") will apply across the european union ("eu") and member states of the european economic area beginning on january 3, 2018, unless this date is extended. implementation of mifid ii will significantly impact both the structure and operation of eu financial markets. some of the main changes introduced under mifid ii include applying enhanced disclosure requirements, enhancing conduct of business and governance requirements, broadening the scope of pre and post trade transparency, increasing transaction reporting requirements, transforming the relationship between client commissions and research, and further regulation of trading venues. compliance with mifid ii will increase our costs.
we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals. however, any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations. they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings. the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and, to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees, it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer.
we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance.
we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation. an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties. from time to time, various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business, including employment-related claims. there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims, class action suits, and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties.
we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed, or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees. certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods. as our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or co-insurance liabilities, or pay higher premiums, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income.
in 2016, we paid $166.2 million to compensate certain t. rowe price mutual funds, trusts, separately managed accounts, and subadvised clients (collectively, "clients") for the denial of their appraisal rights by the delaware chancery court (court) in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of dell, inc. (dell). the court ruled on may 11, 2016, that the clients could not pursue an appraisal of any shares they held that were voted in favor of the dell merger. the appraisal statute governing the transaction required the record holder to vote against or abstain from voting on the transaction in order to assert appraisal rights. after previously voting against prior transaction proposals, the voting instructions submitted on behalf of the clients in connection with voting on the final proposed transaction were incorrectly submitted in favor of the transaction. on may 31, 2016, the court determined that the fair value of dell at the time of the merger was $17.62 per share, as opposed to the $13.75 price offered in the transaction. as a result, any shareholder perfecting appraisal rights is entitled to a payment at $17.62 per share plus statutory interest from the date the dell transaction closed. the compensation to clients was intended to make them whole for the voting discrepancy that resulted in the denial of their appraisal rights. on december 30, 2016, we signed a settlement agreement with our insurance carrier for insurance proceeds totaling $100.0 million related to this matter.
in accordance with the compensation payment, the clients agreed that in the event the findings made by the court regarding the fair value of dell or the amount of interest to be applied were modified by the supreme court of delaware on appeal, t. rowe price and the clients would make an appropriate adjustment between themselves, calculated in a manner that is consistent with the methodology used to compensate clients. in december 2016, several parties, including dell and the successful appraisal petitioners, filed appeals to the delaware supreme court to challenge the chancery court's valuation ruling. our settlement agreement with the insurance carrier provides that if the fair value of dell is reduced, we would work together to make appropriate adjustments.
net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries.
certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal, state, and foreign authorities. each of our subsidiaries' net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements; however, a significant change in the required net capital, an operating loss, or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them.
page  17
united kingdom exit from european union.
we have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the united kingdom ("uk") to support our global investment management business. the ultimate impact of the uk exit ("brexit") from the european union ("eu"), on our business operations in the uk and europe could vary depending on the details of the separation agreement. we are preparing for multiple scenarios, and remain committed to our clients, associates and business expansion across the region.
technology risks.
we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete.
we depend on highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary technology to support our business functions, including among others:
•   securities analysis,
•   securities trading,
•   portfolio management,
•   customer service,
•   accounting and internal financial reporting processes and controls, and
•   regulatory compliance and reporting.
all of our technology systems, including those provided by vendors, are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyber-attacks such as hacking or viruses, natural disasters, power failures, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, and other causes. a suspension or termination of vendor-provided software licenses or related support, upgrades, and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption. although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans, if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation. a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers.
in addition, our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries, and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry, and regulatory demands. we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure. if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion, we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance, which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation.
we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information.
as part of our normal operations, we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients, as well as, proprietary information relating to our business operations. we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of assets, fraudulent financial reporting, and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected. our systems, or those of our third-party service providers we may use to maintain and transmit such information, could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code, or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information. such disclosure could, among other things:
•   seriously damage our reputation,
•   allow competitors access to our proprietary business information,
•   subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data,
•   result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers,
•   subject us to regulatory action, and
•   require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
general.
our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored u.s. mutual funds and other investment portfolios. the other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other sponsored investment portfolios, including collective investment trusts, target date retirement trusts, open-ended investment products offered to investors outside the u.s., and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the u.s.
we manage a broad range of u.s., international and global stock, bond, and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors. investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations. we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients. these efforts involve costs that precede any future revenues that we recognize from an increase to our assets under management.
we remain debt-free with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities; invest in key capabilities, including investment professionals, technologies, and new product offerings; and, most importantly, provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future. we expect to continue our investment in long-term initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent, add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles, expand capabilities through enhanced technology, and broaden our distribution reach globally.
we expect to increase our pace of spending on a series of key strategic priorities to address evolving client needs and to grow and further diversify our business. based on these planned initiatives, we currently expect that our planned operating expenses, excluding the net charge related to the dell appraisal rights matter, will grow in the high-single-digit range in 2017 versus 2016. we could elect to moderate the pace of spending on our planned initiatives should markets decline significantly. in addition, other events not currently planned or expected could impact our expense levels.
background.
u.s. stocks rose strongly in 2016, with major indexes finishing the year near record highs. small-cap stocks substantially outperformed large-caps, and it was the eighth consecutive year for a positive s&p 500 index total return. the year began with fears of a global economic slowdown, which caused a short but sharp correction in equities and commodities. u.s. shares bottomed in mid-february and worked their way higher through late june, as commodity prices rebounded and the u.s. dollar weakened due to diminishing expectations for federal reserve interest rate increases in 2016. in late june, world equity markets experienced a brief but intense sell-off as the uk unexpectedly voted in favor of leaving the european union. however, stocks resumed rising amid expectations that global central banks would provide additional monetary stimulus. in the months prior to the november u.s. elections, the u.s. market's advance was hindered by political uncertainty, as well as uncertainty about the timing of a possible interest rate increase, as fed officials started cautioning that the case for raising short-term rates had "strengthened." stocks surged following the u.s. election results. however, the rally lost some steam in december, as the fed raised short-term rates in mid-december and projected more-than-expected increases in 2017.
developed non-u.s. equity markets significantly underperformed u.s. shares for the year, as returns to u.s. investors were hurt by a stronger dollar versus some major currencies. in dollar terms, asian markets advanced for the year, though japan, page  23
hong kong, and singapore gained less than 3%. european equity markets were widely mixed, with italy-one of the worst-performing markets-dropping more than 9%, due in part to its troubled banking sector.
emerging equity markets outperformed developed non-u.s. markets. brazil led the latin america region with a nearly 67% gain, helped by rebounding commodity prices and by a new president pursuing reforms. in emerging europe, russian shares soared amid firming oil prices, a stronger ruble, and hopes for better relations with the u.s. emerging asian markets were widely mixed.
results of several major equity market indexes for 2016 are as follows:
s&amp;p 500 index                                     12.0%
nasdaq composite index (excluding dividends)           7.5%
russell 2000 index                                    21.3%

global bond returns were mostly positive in 2016. in the u.s., intermediate- and long-term treasury yields declined in the first half of the year, then rebounded in the second half and finished the year above their year-end 2015 levels. the 10-year treasury note yield decreased from 2.3% at the end of 2015 to less than 1.4% around midyear, then it rose to around 2.5% by the end of 2016. in the investment-grade universe, corporate bonds were among the best performers. longer-term treasuries generated modest returns. municipal securities were flat for the year, as they surrendered earlier gains during the fourth quarter amid rising interest rates and cash outflows. high yield bonds strongly outperformed, helped by their lower interest rate sensitivity, investors' demand for securities with attractive yields, and a rebound in oil prices.
bonds in developed non-u.s. markets produced modest positive returns in dollar terms, as significant first-half gains driven by u.s. currency weakness and falling sovereign debt yields were largely offset by a reversal of these trends in the latter half of the year. bonds in emerging markets produced solid gains, as first-half returns driven by dollar weakness and investors' search for attractive yields were only partially eroded by a stronger u.s. dollar in the second half.

assets under management.
our assets under management ended 2016 at $810.8 billion, an increase of $47.7 billion from the end of 2015. during 2016, market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, of $50.5 billion was offset in part by net cash outflows of $2.8 billion. investment advisory clients outside the u.s. account for about 5% of our assets under management at december 31, 2016.

our target date retirement portfolios, which invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other t. rowe price funds or t. rowe price collective investment trusts and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings, continue to be a significant part of our assets under management. assets under management at december 31, 2016, in these target date portfolios totaled $189.2 billion, including $150.9 billion in target date retirement funds and $38.3 billion in target date retirement trusts.

in 2014, the majority of the assets transferred by clients from our sponsored mutual funds to our other investment portfolios disclosed in the table above were moved from our target date retirement funds to our collective investment trusts and target date retirement trusts. in 2015 and 2016, assets were transferred from both target date retirement funds and other mutual funds to our collective investment trusts, target date retirement trusts, and separate accounts.
the net cash flows after client transfers (in billions), by investment vehicle and asset class, over the last three years, are as follows:

the net cash inflows in our sponsored u.s. mutual funds over the last three years were sourced primarily from third-party financial intermediaries across various mandates as detailed below.
in 2014, the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were primarily from a few institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies. in 2015, the net inflows in our other investment portfolios resulted primarily from the client transfers received from the mutual funds. the net outflows prior to the transfers into these portfolios were largely concentrated among a small number of institutional clients who redeemed primarily from large-cap u.s. equity strategies. in 2016, our net cash outflows are largely attributable to institutional and intermediary clients reallocating to passive investments and the impact of our closed investment strategies. the general trend to passive also impacted the net cash flows originating in our target date retirement portfolios. this trend has been persistent and has accelerated in recent years. however, over the long term we expect well-executed active management to play an important role for investors, and we are reinvesting in our company with the objective of delivering strong investment performance and excellent client service like we have historically achieved.

investment performance.
strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting and retaining assets-and to our long-term success. although investment performance relative to our peers has weakened in 2016, it has been strong over the longer term. the percentage of our price funds across their share classes that outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis and percentage in top lipper quartile for the 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-years ended december 31, 2016, were:
1 year   3 years   5 years   10 years us equity                                         51%       93%      100%        94%

all price funds (across their share classes)      53%       84%       80%        86%
price funds in top lipper quartile                26%       39%       54%        55%
in addition, nearly 86% of our price funds' assets under management ended december 31, 2016, with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar. the performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks weakened in 2016 but remains very competitive over longer time periods.

(1) non-operating income varies from year to year due to a number of factors; accordingly the percentage change in non-operating income is not believed to be meaningful.

as detailed in the table above, the percentage increase in investment advisory revenues in 2016 was in line with the increase in our average assets under management. we waived $10.5 million in money market-related fees (including advisory fees and fund expenses) in 2016, a decrease of $37.1 million from the $47.6 million waived in the 2015 period. the fee waivers in 2016 represent less than .5% of total investment advisory revenues earned during the same period. these fees were waived from certain of our money market mutual funds and trusts, which have combined net assets of $15.7 billion at december 31, 2016. we expect money market fee waivers, if any, will be insignificant in 2017. the annual fee rate earned on our assets under management was 47.9 basis points in 2016, virtually unchanged from the 48.0 basis points earned in 2015. the impact on our effective fee rate from the reduction in money market waivers in 2016 was offset by effective fee rate reductions in certain of our sponsored u.s. mutual funds.
our operating expenses include a non-recurring charge, net of insurance recovery, of $66.2 million, or $.15 per share after tax related to the dell appraisal rights matter. in 2016, we paid our clients $166.2 million to compensate them for the denial of their appraisal rights in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of dell. we made claims with our insurance carriers and, on december 30, 2016, entered into an agreement with our primary insurance carrier to recover $100 million from the claim. the insurance proceeds were recognized as an offset to the related $166.2 million charge recognized in the second quarter of 2016. remaining insurance claims filed with respect to this matter that could result in an additional recovery of up to $50 million are still pending.
our operating margin in 2016 was 41.0% compared to 45.2% in the 2015 period. without the impact of the non-recurring charge relating to the dell appraisal rights matter, our operating margin in 2016 would have been 42.6%. the additional decline in our 2016 operating margin results primarily from the investments we have been making to broaden and deepen our investment management, distribution, and service capabilities around the world.
our 2016 results were significantly impacted by the adoption of new accounting guidance related to consolidation and stock-based compensation. the impacts of implementing this new guidance is discussed in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies section of our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this filing.
the impact (in millions) the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios have on the individual lines of our 2016 consolidated statement of income is as follows:
operating expenses reflected in net operating income                                                    $(13.0   )

impact on income before taxes                                                                           $108.1

net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests (unrelated third-party investors)         39.0
$108.1
net revenues investment advisory revenues earned from the t. rowe price mutual funds distributed in the u.s. increased 1.4%, or $37.5 million, to $2.7 billion. average mutual fund assets in 2016 were $495.5 billion, an increase of .4% from the average for the comparable 2015 period. the increase in advisory revenues was due in part to the reduction in money market fee waivers realized in 2016 compared with 2015.
investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios for 2016 were $1,023.3 million, an increase of $3.9 million, or .4%, from the $1,019.4 million earned in 2015. average assets in these portfolios were $282.7 billion during 2016, up 3.1% from the comparable 2015 period. in 2016, our advisory revenues are presented net of $7.0 million related to the elimination of management fees earned on the net assets of certain of our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios. we eliminated these advisory fees in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
administrative fee revenues decreased $9.3 million to $352.5 million in 2016. the decrease is primarily attributable to transfer agent servicing activities provided to the mutual funds and their investors, as well as the shift of fund accounting and portfolio recordkeeping operations to bny mellon that, prior to august 2015, we provided to our sponsored u.s. mutual funds. changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors.
page  28
distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b-1 plans of the advisor, r, and variable annuity ii class shares of our sponsored portfolios were $141.7 million in 2016, a decrease of $9.8 million from the comparable 2015 period on lower average assets under management in these share classes. the 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third- party intermediaries who source these assets. these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements.
operating expenses compensation and related costs was $1,494.0 million in 2016, an increase of $50.4 million, or 3.5%, compared to the 2015 period. the largest part of the increase is attributable to a $56.7 million increase in salaries and related benefits, which resulted from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2016 combined with a 3.2% increase in average headcount from 2015. noncash stock-based compensation expense and annual variable compensation were up $12.6 million and $4.9 million, respectively. these increases were offset by a higher level of technology labor capitalized in 2016 compared with 2015 and a reduction in temporary labor cost as the 2016 projects used more professional service resources. the overall increase in compensation and related costs and our average staff size from 2015 were muted by lower compensation costs resulting from shifting 210 associates in august 2015 to bny mellon and for the ongoing transition support we provide to them. however, these lower compensation costs are generally offset by increases in costs paid to bny mellon to provide these administrative services and other transition-related activities, which are reflected in other operating expenses.
advertising and promotion costs were $79.9 million in 2016 compared with $79.7 million in 2015. we currently expect advertising and promotion costs for 2017 to be up to 10% higher than the 2016 year as we execute on a number of strategic initiatives.
occupancy and facility costs, together with depreciation expense, increased $20.7 million, or 7.3%, compared to 2015. the increase is primarily attributable to the added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs.
other operating expenses were $401.5 million in 2016, an increase of $60.1 million from 2015. about half of this increase is attributable to costs being paid to bny mellon since august 2015 for the performance of certain administrative services, as mentioned above. the increase also includes $6.5 million in operating expenses, net of investment advisory fees earned by us, of those sponsored investment portfolios that we began consolidating at the beginning of 2016. the remaining balance of the change is due to increased business demands and our continued investment in capabilities.
non-operating income net non-operating investment activity during 2016 resulted in income of $227.1 million compared with $103.5 million in 2015. the following table details the components of non-operating income (in millions) during the 2015 and 2016.

the increase in investment gains on sponsored equity method and trading investments is driven by an increase in the number of sponsored funds accounted for as equity method investments as well as market gains. the investment income on consolidated page  29
sponsored investment portfolios has increased in 2016 as the number of portfolios we consolidate, as discussed earlier in this section, increased significantly upon the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance. see the summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing for more information related to the impact of the guidance.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for 2016 was 36.0% compared to 38.9% in 2015. the decrease in the effective tax rate is related in part to the increase in net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest related to our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios as we do not recognize taxes associated with these earnings. additionally, the estimated effective tax rate has declined as a result of adopting the new stock-based compensation accounting guidance as discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8 of this filing. under the new guidance, tax benefits and shortfalls on exercised options and vested restricted stock relative to the stock-based compensation expense recognized are included in the provision for income taxes rather than as additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. our effective income tax rate also reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our u.s. rates. changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from u.s. and foreign sources or changes in tax rates in relevant jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future. we currently estimate that our effective tax rate for 2017 to be 36.5%. our 2017 estimate assumes the tax benefits related to stock-based compensation will be similar to those realized in 2016.

investment advisory revenues earned in 2015 increased over 2014 as our average assets under management increased $43.2 billion, or 6.0%, to $767.9 billion. the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 48.0 basis points in 2015, up from the 47.8 basis points earned in 2014, as money market fee waivers declined and equity valuations, which on average carry a higher fee rate, increased in 2015. we waived $47.6 million in money market-related fees in 2015, including advisory fees and fund expenses, a decrease of $10.8 million from the $58.4 million waived in 2014. the fee waivers in 2015 represent 1.3% of total investment advisory revenues earned during the same period. fees were waived from all our money market mutual funds and trusts, which have combined net assets of $15.7 billion at december 31, 2015.
our operating margin in 2015 was 45.2% compared to 47.5% in the 2014 period. the decline is a result of the investments we have been making to broaden and deepen our investment management, distribution, and service capabilities around the world despite the impact of market volatility on our net revenues.
net revenues investment advisory revenues earned from the t. rowe price mutual funds distributed in the u.s. increased 7.3%, or $182.1 million, to nearly $2.7 billion, on higher average mutual fund assets. average mutual fund assets in 2015 were $493.6 billion, an increase of 7.1% from the average for the comparable 2014 period.
investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios in 2015 were $1.0 billion, an increase of $40.7 million, or 4.2%, from the $978.7 million earned in the comparable 2014 period. average assets in these portfolios were $274.3 billion in 2015, up 4.0% from the comparable 2014 period.

administrative fee revenues decreased $12.2 million to $361.8 million in 2015. the decrease includes the reduction in certain administrative service fee rates paid by certain fund shareholders at the beginning of 2015. additionally, fees earned from the mutual funds for fund accounting has declined in 2015 compared to 2014, as such services began to be performed by bny mellon in august 2015. the mutual funds have contracted directly with bny mellon to provide such services. changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors.
distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b-1 plans of the advisor class, r class, and variable annuity ii class shares of our sponsored portfolios were $151.5 million in 2015, an increase of $7.9 million from 2014 on greater average assets under management in these share classes. the 12b-1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third-party intermediaries who source these assets. these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements.
operating expenses compensation and related costs were $1.4 billion in 2015, an increase of $114.0 million, or 8.6%, compared to 2014. the largest part of the increase is attributable to a $52.6 million increase in salaries and related benefits and a $43.0 million increase in our annual variable compensation program. our average staff size in 2015 increased 3.7% over 2014, and we employed 5,999 associates at december 31, 2015. higher noncash stock-based compensation expense and temporary staff expense account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2015 period. the increase in compensation and related costs and our average staff size were muted by the lower compensation costs resulting from shifting 210 associates and providing ongoing transition support to bny mellon, with whom we contracted to provide fund accounting and recordkeeping operations. however, these lower compensation costs are offset by increases in costs paid to bny mellon to provide these administrative services, which are reflected in other operating expenses.
advertising and promotion costs were $79.7 million in 2015, an increase of $3.7 million from 2014. the higher cost is primarily attributable to the creation and launch of a new advertising campaign and increased participation in promotional activities as we broaden our distribution reach.
occupancy and facility costs, together with depreciation expense, increased $29.9 million, or 11.7%, compared to 2014. the increase is primarily attributable to the added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities, including related maintenance programs.
other operating expenses were $341.4 million in 2015, an increase of $55.0 million from 2014. about a third of the increase is attributable to costs being paid to bny mellon since august 2015 for the performance of certain administrative services. the balance of the change is due to increased business demands and our continued investment in capabilities. these costs include information and third-party service costs, costs related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business, travel-related costs, and other general and administrative costs.

the net loss recognized on deconsolidation represents the reclassification of a foreign currency loss that was accumulated in other comprehensive income from the date we made our initial seed capital investment in an australian dollar-denominated fund. since the deconsolidation, we are accounting for the investment under the equity method of accounting.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was 38.9% in 2015 compared to 38.6% in 2014. our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our u.s. rates.

(1) we implemented new consolidation accounting guidance on january 1, 2016, that resulted in a larger number of our sponsored investment portfolios, that we provide seed capital to at inception, to be consolidated in our financial statements as we were deemed to have a controlling financial interest. we now recognize investment gains and losses on a larger number of the investments in sponsored portfolios in our consolidated statement of income compared to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2015. the non-gaap adjustments add back the management fees we earn from the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and remove the investment income and operating expenses of these portfolios that have been included in our u.s. gaap consolidated statements of income. we believe the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios may impact the reader's ability to understand our core operating results. the following table details the amounts and consolidated statement of income line items in which the amounts were recognized:

(2) this non-gaap adjustment removes the non-operating income that remains after backing out the portion related to the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios. we believe excluding non-operating income helps the reader's ability to understand the firm's core operating results and increases comparability to prior years. additionally, we do not emphasize the impact of non-operating income when managing our firm and evaluating our performance.

(3) as previously disclosed, we made the decision in 2016 to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter. we also recognized an offset to this charge for a related insurance recovery. we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statement of income to adjust for this non-recurring charge, net of the insurance recovery, in arriving at adjusted operating expenses, net income attributable to t. rowe price group, inc., and diluted earnings per share, as this will aid with comparability to prior periods and analyzing our core business results.
(4) these were calculated using the effective tax rate applicable to the related items.
(5) this non-gaap measure was calculated by applying the two-class method to adjusted net income attributable to t. rowe price group, inc., divided by the weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution.

during 2016, stockholders' equity increased from $4.8 billion to $5.0 billion. tangible book value increased to $4.3 billion at december 31, 2016. we paid $2.16 per share in regular dividends in 2016, an increase of 3.8% over the $2.08 per share in regular dividends paid in 2015. additionally, we expended $676.9 million to repurchase 10.0 million shares, or 4.0%, of our outstanding common stock in 2016. these dividends and repurchases were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations. we will generally repurchase our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equity-based compensation plans. in december 2016, our board of directors increased our share repurchase program by 12 million shares.

we remain debt-free with ample liquidity, including cash and discretionary sponsored portfolio investment holdings of $1.9 billion at december 31, 2016. we also have seed capital investments in sponsored investment portfolios of $1.3 billion that are redeemable, although we generally expect to be invested for several years until unrelated third-party investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage. the cash and discretionary sponsored investment holdings held by our subsidiaries outside the u.s. is $.4 million at december 31, 2016.

on january 1, 2016, we implemented new consolidation accounting guidance that resulted in the consolidation of sponsored investment portfolios in which we have a controlling interest. our consolidated balance sheet now reflects the cash and cash equivalents, investments, other assets and liabilities of the sponsored portfolios, as well as redeemable non-controlling interests for the portion of the sponsored portfolios that are held by unrelated third-party investors. although we can redeem our net interest in these sponsored investment portfolios at any time, we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the portfolios to obtain cash for general operations. additionally, the assets of these investment portfolios are not available to our general creditors. our interest in these sponsored investment portfolios was used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed. we assess the discretionary investment portfolio and when we liquidate our interest, we do so in a way as to not impact the portfolio and, ultimately, the unrelated third-party investors.
we anticipate property and equipment expenditures in 2017 to be up to $175 million, of which about two-thirds is planned for technology initiatives. given the availability of our financial resources, we expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with operating resources and do not maintain an available external source of liquidity.

operating activities attributable to t. rowe price group during 2016 provided cash flows of $1,343.7 million, a decrease of $186.8 million from the 2015 period. the decline is primarily related to the payments totaling $166.2 million we made in 2016 to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter. we entered into an agreement on december 30, 2016, for a $100 million insurance recovery that we received in january 2017. the net cash provided by operating activities attributable to t. rowe price group was offset in part by the net change in trading securities held in our consolidated sponsored investments' underlying investment portfolios.
net cash used in investing activities that are attributable to t. rowe price group totaled $219.7 million in 2016. in 2016, we provided $284.5 million in seed capital to new and existing sponsored investment portfolios. we utilized a portion of the $219.5 million in proceeds from the sale of certain available-for-sale investments and equity method investments in 2016 to fund these seed capital investments. since we consolidate these sponsored investment portfolios, the seed capital that we provided was eliminated in preparing our consolidated statement of cash flow. in 2015, cash proceeds from the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings, net of new investments, resulted in investing cash flows of $269.7 million. additionally, our net property and equipment additions were $148.3 million in 2016 compared to $151.3 million in the 2015 period. the cash flow attributable to consolidated sponsored investment portfolios of $41.4 million represents the net cash added to our consolidated balance sheet from consolidating and deconsolidating portfolios in 2016.
net cash used in financing activities attributable to t. rowe price group was $1,091.4 million in 2016 compared with $1,973.3 million in the 2015 period. the decline in cash used in financing activities is largely related to the $2.00 per share, or $524 million, special dividend we paid in april 2015. we also expended $310.9 million less in common stock purchases in 2016 compared to the 2015 period. the cash proceeds received from stock option exercises were higher in 2016 by $52.8 million page  36
compared with the 2015 period. the net cash used in financing activities attributable to t. rowe price group was largely offset by the $915.0 million of net subscriptions into the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios.
2015 versus 2014.
operating activities during 2015 provided cash flows of $1.5 billion, up $215.1 million from the 2014 period. we used $75.0 million less cash in 2015 compared with the 2014 period as we seeded fewer new sponsored investment portfolios. higher noncash depreciation and amortization and noncash stock-based compensation in 2015 increased cash flows by $30.2 million. timing differences on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities increased our operating cash flows by $114.8 million compared to 2014. more than half of the timing difference on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities is related to bonus compensation that was deferred by certain employees under the new supplemental savings plan that went into effect in 2015. the supplemental savings plan provides certain senior officers the opportunity to defer any portion of their cash incentive compensation earned for a respective calendar year during which services are provided for a period of two or more years.
net cash provided by investing activities totaled $109.0 million in 2015 compared with net cash used of $443.4 million in the 2014 period. in 2015, cash proceeds from the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings, net of new investments, resulted in investing cash flows of $269.7 million. this compares with net investments of $305.3 million that we made into our sponsored fund investments in 2014. we increased our property and equipment additions by $25.1 million during 2015 compared to the 2014 period.
net cash used in financing activities was $1,949.2 million in 2015, up $1,209.4 million from the comparable 2014 period. the payment of a $2.00 special dividend on april 23, 2015, and an 18% increase in our regular quarterly per-share dividend accounted for $596.9 million of the increase from 2014. we also increased our common stock repurchases by $572.3 million during 2015 compared with 2014.
contractual obligations.
the following table presents a summary of our future obligations (in millions) under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31, 2016. other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated, under certain conditions that may involve termination fees. because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature, we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations. the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2017 and future years. the information also excludes the $6.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities.

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling $46.4 million at december 31, 2016. the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment. in addition to such amounts, a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances.
critical accounting policies.
the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives. further, significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income, and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements. making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time. accordingly, actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements, significant accounting policies, and notes.
page  37
we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2016 annual report. in the following discussion, we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements.
consolidation. we consolidate all subsidiaries and sponsored investment portfolios in which we have a controlling interest. we are generally deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (vie). vies are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment. our analysis to determine whether an entity is a vie or a voting interest entity (voe) involves judgment and considers several factors, including an entity's legal organization, capital structure, the rights of the equity investment holders, our ownership interest in the entity, and our contractual involvement with the entity. we continually review and reconsider our vie or voe conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events, such as changes to our ownership interest, changes to an entity's legal structure, or amendments to governing documents. our vies are primarily sponsored investment entities and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities.
we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant. our sicav funds and other sponsored investment portfolios regulated outside the u.s. are determined to be vies. at december 31, 2016, we consolidated vies with net assets of $1,389.3 million.
other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities. we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds as available-for-sale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest nor exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies. at the end of each quarter, we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. we review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary.
in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other-than-temporarily impaired, we consider many factors, including the duration of time the impairment has existed, the severity of the impairment, any subsequent changes in value, and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value. subject to the other considerations noted above, we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarter-ends is generally presumed to have an other-than-temporary impairment. we may also recognize an other-than-temporary impairment for losses that have existed for less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a near-term recovery is possible.
other-than-temporary impairments of equity method investments. we evaluate our equity method investments, including our investment in uti and other sponsored investment holdings, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value, and the decline in fair value is other than temporary.
goodwill. we internally conduct, manage, and report our operations as one investment advisory business. we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business. accordingly, we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit-our investment advisory business.
we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach. goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business. our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business (our market capitalization) exceeds our carrying amount (our stockholders' equity) and, therefore, no impairment exists. should we reach a different conclusion in the future, additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized. we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred. the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets, $665.7 million.
stock options. we recognize stock option-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair value-based method. fair value methods use a valuation model for shorter-term, market-traded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration. the black-scholes option-pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations, including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date; the volatility of our underlying common shares in page  38
the market over that time period; and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time. our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted. unlike most of our expenses, the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value-based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by, or adjusted based on, a cash outflow.
provision for income taxes. after compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations. annually, we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. from time to time, we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to, or in the process of, being audited by various tax authorities. because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates, it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. as a result, we recognize additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined.
newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance.
in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09 - revenue from contracts with customers, and subsequently has issued five related accounting standard updates clarifying several aspects of asu 2014-09, including technical corrections and improvements. the overall objective of the new standards updates is to provide a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries, across industries, and across capital markets. the revenue standard contains principles that will be applied to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. we anticipate adopting the new standard on its effective date, january 1, 2018, though we have not yet selected whether we would adopt using the retrospective approach with adjustments to each prior period or the retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initial application recognized at the date of initial application. while we are continuing to assess all potential impacts these standards will have on our financial position and results of operations, early conclusions indicate that these standards will not have a material impact. our implementation efforts include the identification of revenue within the scope of the guidance, as well as the evaluation of revenue contracts. while we have not identified material changes in the timing of revenue recognition, we continue to evaluate the presentation of certain revenue-related costs on a gross versus net basis and related disclosures of revenue.
in january 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-01 - financial instruments - overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. the amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15, 2017, and requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. early adoption is not permitted. the new guidance will require the change in fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be recognized through the income statements. we are currently evaluating the full impact of the standard; however, upon adoption, the change in the fair value of our available-for-sale investments will be recognized in our consolidated income statement rather than our consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
in february 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-02 - leases (topic 842). the objective of the update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position and results of operations, though we expect that our real estate leases will be recognized on our consolidated balance sheet.
in august 2016, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2016-05 - statement of cash flows (topic 230): classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments (a consensus of the emerging issues task force). the amendments in this update provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. the new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. early adoption is permitted. we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
page  39
we have considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, including that which we have not yet adopted. we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation.
forward-looking information.
from time to time, information or statements provided by or on behalf of t. rowe price, including those within this report, may contain certain forward-looking information, including information or anticipated information relating to: our revenues, net income, and earnings per share on common stock; changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management; our expense levels; our estimated effective income tax rate; and our expectations regarding financial markets, future transactions, dividends, investments, capital expenditures, and other conditions. readers are cautioned that any forward-looking information provided by or on behalf of t. rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance. actual results may differ materially from those in forward-looking information because of various factors including, but not limited to, those discussed below and in item 1a, risk factors, of this form 10-k annual report. further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management. such changes result from many factors, including, among other things: cash inflows and outflows in the t. rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios, fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management, our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios, and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participant-directed investments and defined contribution plans. the ability to attract and retain investors' assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence; the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes; the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels; competitive conditions in the mutual fund, asset management, and broader financial services sectors; and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business. our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements. non-operating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments, changes in their market valuations, and any other-than-temporary impairments that may arise or, in the case of our equity method investments, our proportionate share of the investees' net income.
our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses, which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons: changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses in response to market conditions, including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the u.s. and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the u.s.; the pace and level of our planned increase in spending to support key strategic priorities; variations in the level of total compensation expense due to, among other things, bonuses, restricted stock units and other equity grants, other incentive awards, changes in our employee count and mix, and competitive factors; any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise; fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations; expenses and capital costs, such as technology assets, depreciation, amortization, and research and development, incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure; unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients; and disruptions of services, including those provided by third parties, such as fund and portfolio recordkeeping, facilities, communications, power, and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems.
our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation, and changes in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax, and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results, including, but not limited to, effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments.

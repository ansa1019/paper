item 1a.   risk factors risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that are currently not believed to be significant to our business may also affect our actual results and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. if any of the risks or uncertainties described below or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions.
our acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:
   unforeseen difficulties in integrating personnel and sales forces, operations, manufacturing, logistics, research and

development, information technology, communications, purchasing, accounting, marketing, administration and other systems and processes;

   harmonizing and optimizing quality systems and operations;

   diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;

   unforeseen difficulties related to entering geographic regions where we do not have prior experience;

   potential loss of key employees;

   unforeseen liabilities associated with businesses acquired; and

   inability to generate sufficient revenue or realize sufficient cost savings to offset acquisition or investment costs.

as a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. these risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions.
we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the biomet and ldr mergers and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations.
we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the biomet and ldr holding corporation (ldr) mergers. at december 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was $11.2 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion at december 31, 2014. we funded the cash portion of the biomet merger consideration, the pay-off of certain indebtedness of biomet and the payment of transaction-related expenses through a combination of available cash-on-hand and proceeds from debt financings, including proceeds from a $7.65 billion issuance of senior unsecured notes in march 2015 and borrowings of $3.0 billion under a five-year term loan in june 2015. in addition, in september 2016, we borrowed $750 million under a three-year unsecured term loan facility and utilized these funds to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility incurred in connection with the acquisition of ldr. also, in december 2016, we issued 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes and used the proceeds to repay a portion of the u.s. dollar-denominated senior notes issued in connection with the biomet merger. as of december 31, 2016, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding capital leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months are expected to be $891.1 million. as a result of the increase in our debt, demands on our cash resources have increased. the increased level of debt could, among other things:
   require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

   limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

10
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report
   restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;

   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

   adversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase and our ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;

   adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and

   limit our ability to apply proceeds from a future offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.

if we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
our industry is subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the federal false claims act, the federal anti-kickback statute, the federal stark law, the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state and foreign laws. in addition, we are subject to various federal and foreign laws concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters, sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations. violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the u.s., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including medicare, medicaid and veterans administration health programs. these laws are administered by, among others, the doj, the oig-hhs, the sec, the ofac, the bureau of industry and security of the u.s. department of commerce and state attorneys general.
we are also subject to federal, state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy and security regulations promulgated under hipaa. the fda also has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices.
international data protection laws, including the eu data protection directive and member state implementing legislation, may also apply to some of our operations and restrict our ability to collect, analyze and transfer eu personal data. moreover, the general data protection regulation, an eu-wide regulation that will be fully enforceable by may 25, 2018, will introduce new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for violations of the data protection rules.
the interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change.
if we fail to comply with the terms of the dpa that we entered into in january 2017, we may be subject to criminal prosecution and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
on january 12, 2017, we resolved previously-disclosed fcpa matters involving biomet and certain of its subsidiaries.
as part of the settlement, we entered into a dpa with the doj. a copy of the dpa is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this report.
if we do not comply with the terms of the dpa, we could be subject to prosecution for violating the internal controls provisions of the fcpa and the conduct of biomet and its subsidiaries described in the dpa, which conduct pre-dated our acquisition of biomet, as well as any new or continuing violations. we could also be subject to exclusion by oig-hhs from participation in federal healthcare programs, including medicaid and medicare. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all. delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.
both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations. compliance with the fdas requirements, including the qsr, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the fda, which may result in observations on form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement. if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the fda could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such devices, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates to foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. the fda may also impose operating restrictions including a ceasing of operations, on one or more facilities, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. the fda could also issue a corporate warning letter, a recidivist warning letter or a consent decree of permanent injunction. the fda may also recommend prosecution to the doj. any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and
11
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in 2012, we received a warning letter from the fda citing concerns relating to certain processes pertaining to products manufactured at our ponce, puerto rico manufacturing facility. in june 2015, biomet received a warning letter from the fda that requested additional information to allow the fda to evaluate the adequacy of biomets responses to certain form 483 observations issued following an inspection of biomets zhejiang, china manufacturing facility in january 2015. in may 2016, we received a warning letter from the fda related to observed non-conformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the qsr at our facility in montreal, quebec, canada. as of december 31, 2016, these warning letters remained pending. until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the fda as described above, the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the fda may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additional information regarding these and other fda regulatory matters can be found in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the international standards organization. if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have manufacturing sites all over the world. in some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disaster-related events, or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the qsr and good manufacturing practice requirements, equipment breakdown or malfunction or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. in the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand. in the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals. as a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.
we operate in a highly competitive environment. our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies. to remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies. competition is primarily on the basis of:
   technology;

   innovation;

   quality;

   reputation; and

   customer service.

in markets outside of the u.s., other factors influence competition as well, including:
   local distribution systems;

   complex regulatory environments; and

   differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

our competitors may:
   have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

   respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

   undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

   adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

   be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.
if we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
our marketing success in the u.s. and abroad depends significantly upon our agents and distributors sales and service expertise in the marketplace. many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents detailed knowledge of products and instruments. a loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.
demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:
   evolving customer needs;

   changing demographics;

   slowing industry growth rates;

   declines in the musculoskeletal implant market;

   the introduction of new products and technologies;

   evolving surgical philosophies; and

   evolving industry standards.

without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. if that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer. the success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
   properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

   commercialize new products in a timely manner;

   manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;

12
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report
   differentiate our offerings from competitors offerings;

   achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products;

   satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost procedures;

   innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and

   provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

in addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:
   entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

   the need for regulatory clearance; and

   uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production. in addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.
if third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed.
we sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, all of which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs. these third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and devices.
in addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. if third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels to hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets. if key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.
the ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs. group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organizations affiliated hospitals and other members. if we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturers products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement. our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.
we conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the u.s., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.
we sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived nearly 40 percent of our net sales in 2016 from outside the u.s. we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations. our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:
   changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

   unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;

   differing local product preferences and product requirements;

   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

   diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the u.s.;

   trade protection measures and import or export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;

   foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;

   complex data privacy requirements and labor relations laws;

   extraterritorial effects of u.s. laws such as the fcpa;

   effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the uk bribery act;

   difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

   labor force instability;

   potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

   political and economic instability.

violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.
13
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
we purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party vendors and we outsource some key manufacturing activities. certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. in certain cases, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of fda regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors manufacturing processes. a reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
moreover, we are subject to the secs rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries. this rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability. in addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products. we have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our due diligence procedures. as a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders.
we may have additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the u.s., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates. in addition, there have been proposals to change u.s. tax laws that would significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.
we are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.
a substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in europe and japan. the u.s. dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. significant increases in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to the euro or the japanese yen, as well as other currencies, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.
pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. in the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. as discussed further in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the durom® acetabular component (durom cup), certain products within the nexgen knee system, and the m2a-magnumtm hip system. the majority of the durom cup cases are pending in a federal multidistrict litigation (mdl) in the district of new jersey (in re: zimmer durom hip cup products liability litigation); the majority of the nexgen knee system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of illinois (in re: zimmer nexgen knee implant products liability litigation); and the majority of the m2a-magnum hip system cases are pending in a federal mdl in the northern district of indiana (in re: biomet m2a magnum hip implant products liability litigation). we are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products. any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend. product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.
although we maintain third-party product liability insurance coverage, we have substantial self-insured retention amounts that we must pay in full before obtaining any insurance proceeds to satisfy a judgment or settlement. furthermore, even if any product liability loss is covered by our insurance, it is possible that claims against us may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies and we would
14
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report have to pay the amount of any settlement or judgment that is in excess of our policy limits. product liability claims in excess of applicable insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.
claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly. at any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. we rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets and non-disclosure and other agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. while we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets and other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage. third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
in addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable or of limited effect in some foreign countries. if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our competitiveness in international markets could be impaired, which could limit our growth and revenue.
we also attempt to protect our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation with security measures, including the use of non-disclosure and other agreements with our employees, consultants and collaborators. we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.
we are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
in addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. for example, as discussed further in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, we are defending a purported class action lawsuit, shah v. zimmer biomet holdings, inc. et al., filed against us and certain of our officers alleging violations of the securities laws related to our third quarter 2016 performance and 2016 forecasts. although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome. we could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data, including from data breaches, our business could be adversely affected.
we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure. as a result of technology initiatives, recently enacted regulations, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, including the biomet merger, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities. we also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and, as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. our information systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. in addition, given their size and complexity, these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information (including, but not limited to, intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information). cyber-attacks, such as those involving the deployment of malware, are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity and have become increasingly difficult to detect. if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could:
   lose existing customers;

   have difficulty attracting new customers;

15
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report
   have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing;

   have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud;

   have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals;

   have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed;

   incur increased operating expenses;

   incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach; or

   suffer other adverse consequences.

while we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful. despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that cyber-attacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future. any significant breakdown, intrusion, breach, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
we have determined that a material weakness exists in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in a material misstatement in our financial statements.
we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rule 13a-15(e) and 13a-15(f) under the exchange act. as discussed in managements report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under item 7a of this report, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2016 related to managements controls over accounting for income taxes. a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. as a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31, 2016. we are actively engaged in developing and implementing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. however, we cannot provide any assurance that these remediation efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of these efforts. if the remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.
future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.
our assets include intangible assets, primarily goodwill. at december 31, 2016, we had $10.5 billion in goodwill. the goodwill results from our acquisition activity, including the biomet merger, and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired. we assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable. if the operating performance at one or more of our business units falls significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, or if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, we could be required, under current u.s. accounting rules, to record a non-cash charge to operating earnings for the amount of the impairment. any write-off of a material portion of our unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.
recent developments relating to the united kingdoms referendum vote in favor of leaving the european union could adversely affect us.
the united kingdom (uk) held a referendum on june 23, 2016 in which voters approved the uks voluntary exit from the european union (eu), commonly referred to as brexit. the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business. the effects of brexit are expected to be far-reaching. brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions in europe and globally and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets. brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services and people between the uk and the eu; however, the full effects of brexit are uncertain and will depend on any agreements the uk may make to retain access to eu markets. brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate. also, as a result of brexit, other european countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the eu. given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by brexit is uncertain.
anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, our restated by-laws and the delaware general corporation law may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.
these provisions provide for, among other things:
   the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without further stockholder action;

   certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; and

          the prohibition on engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the time at which a person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met, as set forth in section 203 of the delaware general corporation law.

these anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third partys offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. as a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.
our restated by-laws designate certain delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.
our restated by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the state of delaware (or, if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated by-laws, as either may be amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. this choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
item 7.   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. certain percentages presented in this discussion and analysis are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts and therefore may not recalculate from the rounded numbers used for disclosure purposes. certain amounts in the 2015 and 2014 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.
on june 24, 2015, we completed our merger with biomet and its results of operations have been included in our results starting on that date. the biomet merger was a transformational event for us and has had significant effects on all aspects of our business. accordingly, our sales and expenses increased significantly in the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 when compared to prior years.
in portions of this discussion and analysis, we also present sales information on an unaudited, pro forma basis for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014. this pro forma information includes zimmer and biomet sales in those periods as if the merger occurred on january 1, 2014. accordingly, the pro forma net sales information for periods prior to the closing date includes the net sales of biomet, but does not include the impact of the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets. we believe this pro forma analysis is beneficial for investors because it represents how the merged companies may have performed on a combined basis in 2015 and 2014.
executive level overview
2016 results in 2016, we made strategic internal and external investments to further broaden and diversify our musculoskeletal portfolio, including the acquisitions of ldr, which provided us with an immediate position in the growing cervical disc replacement market; cayenne medical, inc. (cayenne medical), a sports medicine company; compression therapy concepts, inc. (ctc), a provider of non-invasive products for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis; cd diagnostics, inc. (cd diagnostics), a medical diagnostic testing company; and medtech sa (medtech), a designer and manufacturer of robotic equipment for brain and spine surgeries. these commercial additions have both enhanced our core offerings and expanded our presence across the full continuum and episode of care.
we have also continued to make progress in our commercial and operational integration of biomet across all geographies and functions. despite this progress, sales in 2016 were below our expectations due in part to some temporary disruption in product supply in certain knee, hip, upper extremities, sports medicine and trauma product lines in the second half of 2016 related to several factors, including implementation of operational and quality process enhancements that resulted in various shipment delays, and manufacturing forecasting constraints related to continued integration of our supply chain. in the second half of 2016, we saw increased demand for certain knee, hip and upper extremities products, particularly related to cross-selling various offerings across the combined zimmer biomet portfolio. the increased demand temporarily impacted our ability to effectively respond to this shifting product mix. in response, we accelerated work to enhance certain aspects of our supply chain infrastructure as we harmonize and optimize our sourcing, manufacturing and quality management systems. we are in the process of deploying new demand planning and production planning tools. we made progress on these enhancements in late 2016 and anticipate continued progress towards the replenishment of safety stocks on key cross-sell products throughout the first half of 2017.
our 2016 results have been significantly impacted by the inclusion of biomet sales and expenses for the entire year, including sales growth of 28.1 percent. on an unaudited pro forma basis, sales increased by 2.2 percent driven by volume/mix growth across all our regions in most of our product categories, including growth from our 2016 acquisitions, offset by the negative effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and continued, but stable, pricing pressure in all of our geographic regions.
our net earnings increased in 2016 compared to 2015. the primary drivers of the improved earnings performance were the inclusion of biomet earnings for the entire year and the absence in 2016 of significant expenses incurred in 2015 in connection with completing the biomet merger. as a result of the merger, we recognized significant expenses in 2015 due to the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stock-based awards, retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and third-party sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date, severance expense, a loss related to a call premium on biomet debt we redeemed, third party fees, and other acquisition and integration charges. while we did incur similar expenses in 2016 related to acquisitions, they were less significant.
2017 outlook we estimate our sales growth in 2017 over 2016 will be in a range of 2.2 to 3.2 percent. this estimate assumes foreign currency exchange rates will decrease sales by approximately 1.5 percent, continued pricing pressure will decrease sales by approximately 2 percent and the inclusion of ldr sales for the full year will increase sales by approximately 1.2 percent. as noted previously, we expect to make substantial progress in remediating supply constraints during the first half of this year as we prioritize production for key cross-sell brands, clear our back orders, and restore safety stocks.
additionally, as part of our effort to implement certain regulatory compliance enhancements, we are making operational and quality process improvements in certain of our major production facilities. as such, affected products may experience temporary and occasional distribution delays while
21
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report we implement and validate these enhanced processes and generate the necessary supporting records. we believe that continued progress towards restoring full supply expected during the second quarter will enable our commercial teams to service existing customers and also resume executing against the full potential of our broad and diverse portfolio. as such, we expect volume/mix sales growth to improve as we progress through 2017.
turning to cost of products sold, in 2016 we recognized significant expenses related to stepping up acquired biomet inventory to fair value and for excess and obsolete inventory charges from our decision to discontinue certain products. without these significant expenses, we expect cost of products sold will decrease in 2017. additionally, due to the two year moratorium on the u.s. medical device excise tax, costs of products sold will decrease. however, we believe we will experience unfavorable effects on costs of products sold as a percentage of sales from declining selling prices, as well as from lower hedge gains expected to be recognized in 2017 when compared to 2016.
as it relates to other expenses, our intangible asset amortization expense is expected to increase as we recognize a full year of intangible asset amortization from the ldr merger and other 2016 acquisitions. we expect research and development (r&d) expense for the year to be approximately 4.5 percent of sales. selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense is expected to approximate 37.5 percent of sales, which is an improvement from 2016 as we expect to realize synergies from our acquisitions and leverage sales growth. we estimate special items expense will continue to be significant as we continue our integration activities as well as harmonize and optimize our supply chain and manufacturing and quality systems. however, we expect special items expense will be less in 2017 compared to 2016. we expect interest expense will decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower debt levels from planned debt repayments.
results of operations we analyze sales by three geographies, the americas, emea and asia pacific, and by the following product categories: knees, hips, s.e.t., dental, spine & cmf and other. this sales analysis differs from our reportable operating segments, which are based upon our senior management organizational structure and how we allocate resources towards achieving operating profit goals. we analyze sales by geography because the underlying market trends in any particular geography tend to be similar across product categories and because we primarily sell the same products in all geographies.

as previously discussed, sales increased significantly in 2016 when compared to prior years due to the inclusion of biomet sales for the entire year. therefore, we analyze sales on a pro forma basis because it represents how the zimmer and biomet underlying businesses may have performed. sales discussion in this management discussion and analysis focuses on sales trends on a pro forma basis since that is how we analyze our business.
demand (volume/mix) trends increased volume and changes in the mix of product sales contributed 4.9 percentage points of year-over-year sales growth during 2016 on a pro forma basis. volume/mix growth was driven by recent product introductions, sales in key emerging markets, an aging population and 2016 acquisitions (including ldr, which contributed 1.1 percentage points of growth).
we believe long-term indicators point toward sustained growth driven by an aging global population, growth in emerging markets, obesity, proven clinical benefits, new material technologies, advances in surgical techniques and more active lifestyles, among other factors. in addition, demand for clinically proven premium products and patient specific devices are expected to continue to positively affect sales growth in markets that recognize the value of these advanced technologies.
pricing trends global selling prices had a negative effect of 1.5 percentage points on year-over-year sales during 2016 on a pro forma basis. the negative 1.5 percent effect on year-over-year sales was consistent with the range experienced over the past several years. the majority of countries in which we operate continue to experience pricing pressure from governmental healthcare cost containment efforts and from local hospitals and health systems.
foreign currency exchange rates in 2016, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect of 0.3 percentage points on year-over-year sales on a pro forma basis. we address currency risk through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of forward contracts and foreign currency options solely to manage foreign currency volatility and risk. changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect sales growth, but due to offsetting gains/losses on hedge contracts and options, which

zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report are recorded in cost of products sold, the effect on net earnings in the near term is reduced.
sales by product category knees on a pro forma basis, knee sales experienced steady volume/mix growth in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by recent product introductions, such as persona the personalized knee system, cross-sell opportunities, and strong performance in our asia pacific operating segment. volume/mix growth was partially offset by continued pricing pressure and the divestiture of certain product line rights and assets.
hips on a pro forma basis, hips sales experienced steady volume/mix growth in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by recent product introductions, such as the g7 acetabular system, and strong performance in our asia pacific operating segment. volume/mix growth was partially offset by continued pricing pressure.
s.e.t.
on a pro forma basis, our s.e.t. sales have continued positive volume/mix trends in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by a growing emphasis on sales force specialization, strong performance by key brands and 2016 acquisitions. this product categorys sub-categories all experienced growth in 2016 despite continued pricing pressure.
dental on a pro forma basis, dental sales have continued to decline. in the second half of 2015, we experienced a supply disruption related to a voluntary field action in response to a packaging issue which we were not able to remediate until 2016, which affected our sales. looking forward, we must improve our commercial execution to get back to market growth rates.
spine & cmf on a pro forma basis, spine and cmf sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the ldr merger and continued strong performance of our cmf products.

the decrease in gross margin percentage in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to increased intangible asset amortization from the 2016 acquisitions, excess and obsolete inventory charges for certain product lines we intend to discontinue, lower average selling prices and lower hedge gains in 2016 from our foreign currency hedging program compared to 2015. under the hedging program, for derivatives which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income and then recognized in cost of products sold when the hedged items affect earnings. these unfavorable items were partially offset by lower inventory step-up charges from the biomet merger and lower expense from the u.s. medical device excise tax, in each case in 2016 compared to 2015.
in 2015, we experienced a decrease in gross margin percentage compared to 2014 primarily due to increased inventory step-up charges and intangible asset amortization from the biomet merger.

zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report operating expenses r&d expenses and r&d as a percentage of sales have increased over the last three years, driven primarily by the biomet merger and 2016 acquisitions. the combination of our r&d functions subsequent to the merger allow us to allocate a greater portion of the combined r&d spending towards innovation efforts to address unmet clinical needs and create new market adjacencies. additionally, most of our r&d activities occur in the u.s., so expenses do not decrease proportionally to changes in net sales when there are significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributes to an increase in r&d as a percentage of sales. we expect r&d spending in 2017 to stay consistent and be approximately 4.5 percent of sales.
sg&a expenses and sg&a as a percentage of sales have increased over the last three years, driven primarily by the biomet merger and 2016 acquisitions. we expect that sg&a as a percentage of sales will continue to be higher than prior to these mergers and acquisitions until we can realize synergy benefits of the transactions and further leverage sales growth. in 2017, we expect to make additional progress in our synergy programs with sg&a as a percentage of sales estimated to be approximately 37.5 percent of sales.
certain claims expense is for estimated liabilities to durom cup patients undergoing revision surgeries. since 2008, we have recognized $479.4 million for these claims. for more information regarding these claims, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
we recognize expenses resulting directly from our business combinations, employee termination benefits, certain r&d agreements, certain contract terminations, consulting and professional fees and asset impairment or loss on disposal charges connected with global restructuring, quality and operational excellence initiatives, and other items as special items in our consolidated statement of earnings. we recognized significant expenses in 2015 due to biomet merger-related expenses, such as the acceleration of unvested lvb stock options and lvb stock-based awards, retention bonuses paid to biomet employees and third-party sales agents who remained with biomet through the closing date, severance expense and contract terminations. expenses declined in 2016 due to the absence of certain of these expenses. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding special items charges.
other expense, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes in 2016, other expense, net, primarily included a $53.3 million loss on debt extinguishment. it also included losses on the sale of certain assets and the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than an entitys functional currency, offset by foreign currency forward exchange contracts we enter into to mitigate any gain or loss. in 2015, other expense, net, included a $22.0 million loss on debt extinguishment, debt issuance costs that we recognized for a bridge credit agreement that we entered into in may 2014 in connection with the biomet merger, the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities, partially offset by a gain related to selling certain product line rights and assets. in 2014, other expense, net, only included debt issuance costs that we recognized for the bridge credit agreement and the net expense related to remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities.
net interest expense has increased due to the issuance of the debt in connection with the ldr merger in july 2016 and biomet merger in march 2015.
our effective tax rate (etr) on earnings before income taxes for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was 23.8 percent, 4.6 percent and 23.4 percent, respectively. we have incurred significant expenses associated with the biomet merger and other acquisitions which were generally recognized in higher income tax jurisdictions. accordingly, this reduced our etr as our earnings were lower in these higher income tax jurisdictions. additionally, other discrete adjustments have occurred that have significantly affected our etr. in 2016, we recognized $40.6 million of tax benefits from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with taxing authorities. these benefits were partially offset by $27.6 million of additional tax provisions related to finalizing the tax accounts of the biomet merger. the low 2015 tax rate resulted from operating losses in the u.s. caused by significant expenses incurred in connection with the merger. our etr in future periods could potentially be impacted by changes in our mix of pre-tax earnings; changes in tax rates, tax laws or their interpretation, including the european union rules on state aid; the outcome of various federal, state and foreign audits; and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. currently, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these items on our financial results.
segment operating profit similar to our consolidated results, our segment operating profit has been significantly impacted by the addition of biomet sales and expenses to these segments. in the americas, operating profit as a percentage of sales increased due to synergies from the biomet merger and a two year moratorium on the u.s. medical device excise tax for the calendar years of 2016 and 2017. under the applicable accounting rules that we applied to the u.s. medical device excise tax, we still had a portion of the tax paid prior to the moratorium included in the cost of inventory and continued to recognize expense, albeit at a lower level than in 2015, related to the tax through the fourth quarter of 2016. in 2017, we intend to invest the savings from the medical device excise tax moratorium into our business in areas such as r&d, sales force specialization and medical training and education.
in emea, operating profit as a percentage of sales declined due to the increased expenses related to the biomet merger, lower average selling prices and a reduced impact of hedge gains. in emea, even though our integration plans are on schedule, it will take longer to realize the full synergies of the merger compared to other segments due to the multiple

non-gaap operating performance measures we use financial measures that differ from financial measures determined in accordance with gaap to evaluate our operating performance. these non-gaap financial measures exclude the impact of inventory step-up; certain inventory and manufacturing-related charges connected to discontinuing certain product lines, quality enhancement and remediation efforts; intangible asset amortization; special items; certain claims; financing and other expenses/gains related to the biomet merger and other acquisitions; debt extinguishment; the interest expense incurred on the senior notes issued in connection with the biomet merger during the period prior to the consummation of the biomet merger; any related effects on our income tax provision associated with these items and other certain tax adjustments. other certain tax adjustments primarily include internal restructuring transactions to integrate biomet operations and facilitate access to offshore earnings, resolution of certain matters with taxing authorities, adjustments to deferred tax liabilities recognized as part of acquisition-related accounting, the resolution of unrecognized tax positions established through goodwill as part of acquisition accounting that had not previously been recognized in the earnings of the acquired company and any tax item that would otherwise be distortive to the expected future tax rate. we use these non-gaap financial measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business and believe they are useful measures that provide meaningful supplemental information to investors to consider when evaluating our performance. we believe these measures offer the ability to make period-to-period comparisons that are not impacted by certain items that can cause dramatic changes in reported operating results, to perform trend analysis, to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by these types of items and to provide additional transparency of certain items. in addition, certain of these non-gaap financial measures are used as performance metrics in our incentive compensation programs.
our non-gaap adjusted net earnings used for internal management purposes for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $1,610.8 million, $1,310.5 million, and $1,098.0 million, respectively, and our non-gaap adjusted diluted earnings per share were $7.96, $6.90, and $6.40, respectively.

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities increased to $1,632.2 million in 2016 compared to $849.8 million and $1,060.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increased operating cash flows in 2016 were primarily from the inclusion of biomet cash flows for the entire year. we also sold $103.1 million of our accounts receivable in certain countries in 2016, which improved operating cash flows. conversely, in 2015 we had various significant cash outflows, including a $97.6 million loss on our forward starting interest rate swaps we settled and expenses related to completing the biomet merger. in 2017, we expect operating cash flows to be in a range of $1,750.0 million to $1,900.0 million.
cash flows used in investing activities were $1,691.5 million in 2016 compared to $7,557.9 million and $469.4 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. instrument and property, plant and equipment additions increased due to the biomet merger as we continue to invest in the combined company product portfolio and optimize our manufacturing and logistics network. purchases and sales of investments in debt securities declined because as investments matured, we used the cash to pay off debt and repurchase shares of our common stock. in the 2016 period, we also invested in the cayenne, ctc, ldr, cd diagnostics and medtech acquisitions and other various assets. in 2017, we expect to spend approximately $330.0 million on instruments and $170.0 million on property, plant and equipment to support the ongoing business.
cash flows used in financing activities were $743.2 million in 2016. this reflected approximately $1,010.0 million of net principal repayments on the senior notes and term loan we issued in 2015 for the biomet merger. we also borrowed $750.0 million in 2016 for the ldr merger.
in february, may, july and december 2016, our board of directors declared cash dividends of $0.24 per share. we expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are subject to approval of the board of directors and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change. as further discussed below, our debt facilities restrict the payment of dividends in certain circumstances.
in february 2016, our board of directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share repurchase program effective march 1, 2016, with no expiration date. the previous program expired on february 29, 2016. as of december 31, 2016, all $1.0 billion remained authorized for repurchase under the program.
we will continue to exercise disciplined capital allocation designed to drive stockholder value creation. we intend to use available cash for reinvestment in the business, debt repayment, dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. if the right opportunities arise, we may also use available cash to pursue business development opportunities.
in order to achieve operational synergies, we expect cash outlays related to our integration plans to be approximately $310.0 million in 2017. these cash outlays are necessary to achieve our integration goals of net annual pre-tax operating profit synergies of $350.0 million by mid-2018.
as discussed in note 16 to our consolidated financial statements, the internal revenue service (irs) has issued proposed adjustments for years 2005 through 2009 reallocating profits between certain of our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries. we have disputed these proposed adjustments and continue to pursue resolution with the irs. although the ultimate timing for resolution of the disputed tax issues is uncertain, future payments may be significant to our operating cash flows.
as discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements, as of december 31, 2016, a short-term liability of $75.0 million and long-term liability of $218.6 million related to durom cup product liability claims was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. we expect to continue paying these claims over the next few years. we expect to be reimbursed a portion of these payments for product liability claims from insurance carriers. as of december 31, 2016, we have received a portion of the insurance proceeds we estimate we will recover. we have a long-term receivable of $95.3 million remaining for future expected reimbursements from our insurance carriers. we also had a short-term liability of $57.4 million related to biomet metal-on-metal hip implant claims.
at december 31, 2016, we had twelve tranches of senior notes outstanding as follows (dollars in millions):

zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report that will mature on september 30, 2021. there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility as of december 31, 2016. we also have other available uncommitted credit facilities totaling $47.1 million.
for additional information on our debt, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.
we place our cash and cash equivalents in highly-rated financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one entity. we invest only in high-quality financial instruments in accordance with our internal investment policy.
as of december 31, 2016, $408.6 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in jurisdictions outside of the u.s. of this amount, $77.8 million is denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, bears no foreign currency translation risk. the balance of these assets is denominated in currencies of the various countries where we operate.
in light of our commitments under various credit facilities, as well as our expectation for continued business development, we have plans to repatriate a significant portion of our offshore earnings to the u.s. in particular, as a result of the biomet merger, we have unremitted foreign earnings of $3,658.7 million, which we plan to repatriate to the u.s. in future periods. we have estimated a long-term deferred tax liability of $1,190.7 million for the estimated tax impact of this repatriation.
management believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the multicurrency revolving facility are sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service needs, as well as to return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. should additional investment opportunities arise, we believe that our earnings, balance sheet and cash flows will allow us to obtain additional capital, if necessary.
contractual obligations we have entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business that will require future payments. the following table illustrates our contractual obligations (in millions):

$82.2 million of the other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet as of december 31, 2016 are liabilities related to defined benefit pension plans. defined benefit plan liabilities are based upon the underfunded status of the respective plans; they are not based upon future contributions. due to uncertainties regarding future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and our intentions with respect to voluntary contributions, we are unable to reasonably estimate future contributions beyond 2016. therefore, this table does not include any amounts related to future contributions to our plans. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our defined benefit plans.
also included in other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet are liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and corresponding interest and penalties thereon. due to the uncertainties inherent in these liabilities, such as the ultimate timing and resolution of tax audits, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or period in which potential tax payments related to these positions will be made. therefore, this table does not include any obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits. we have also excluded long-term deferred tax liabilities from this table, as they do not represent liabilities that will be settled in cash. see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these tax-related accounts.
we have entered into various agreements that may result in future payments dependent upon various events such as the achievement of certain product r&d milestones, sales milestones, or, at our discretion, to maintain exclusive rights to distribute a product. since there is uncertainty on the timing or whether such payments will have to be made, we have not included them in this table. these payments could range from $0 to $57 million.
critical accounting estimates our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. significant accounting policies which require managements judgment are discussed below.
excess inventory and instruments  we must determine as of each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at our carrying cost. similarly, we must also determine if instruments on hand will be put to productive use or remain undeployed as a result of excess supply. accordingly, inventory and instruments are written down to their net realizable value. to determine the appropriate net realizable value, we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products and instrument systems and components. the basis for the determination is generally the same for all inventory and instrument items and categories except for work-in-process inventory, which is recorded at cost. obsolete or discontinued items are generally destroyed and completely written off. management evaluates the need for changes to inventory and instruments net realizable values based on market conditions, competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis.
income taxes  our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits
29
zimmer biomet holdings, inc.   2016 form 10-k annual report reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
we estimate income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction. realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits. we evaluate deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provide valuation allowances unless we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will be realized. federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the u.s.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve. we record our income tax provisions based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances, including existing tax laws, our experience with previous settlement agreements, the status of current examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters.
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards boards (fasb) guidance on income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.
commitments and contingencies  accruals for product liability and other claims are established with the assistance of internal and external legal counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims, related legal fees and for claims incurred but not reported. we use an actuarial model to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims. historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model.
in addition to our general product liability, we have recorded provisions totaling $479.4 million related to the durom cup. see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the durom cup litigation.
goodwill and intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. we evaluate the carrying value of finite life intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. significant assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, most notably estimated future cash flows generated by these assets. as such, these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs. changes to these assumptions could require us to record impairment charges on these assets.
we have seven reporting units with goodwill assigned to them. in our 2016 impairment test, our emea reporting units estimated fair value only exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by 8 percent, or approximately $240 million. the goodwill balance of the emea reporting unit at the time of the impairment test was $1,326.0 million. this reporting units estimated fair value continues to be lower than in past years due to the weakening of the euro against the u.s. dollar. we estimated the fair value of this reporting unit by using a combination of income and market approaches. fair value under the income approach was determined by discounting to present value the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. fair value under the market approach utilized the guideline public company methodology, which uses valuation indicators determined from other businesses that are similar to the reporting unit. in estimating the future cash flows of the reporting unit, we utilized a combination of market and company-specific inputs that a market participant would use in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. the primary market input was revenue growth rates. these rates were based on historical trends and estimated future growth drivers such as an aging population, obesity and more active lifestyles. significant company-specific inputs included assumptions regarding how the reporting unit could leverage operating expenses as revenue grows and the impact any new products will have on revenues. discount rates used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows considered the weighted average cost of capital of other comparable companies and the country risk of our reporting unit. under the guideline public company methodology, we took into consideration differences between the reporting unit and the comparable companies.
the emea reporting unit remains sensitive to changes in market conditions. if estimated cash flows for this reporting unit decrease, we may be required to record impairment charges in the future. the cash flows used in our annual impairment test are estimates and therefore involve uncertainty. factors that could result in our actual cash flows being lower than our current estimates include: 1) decreased revenues caused by unforeseen changes in these areas of the healthcare market, our inability to generate new product revenue from our research and development activities, or macroeconomic factors that may affect consumers ability to pay for these products and 2) our inability to achieve the estimated operating margins for these reporting units forecasts due to unforeseen factors. additionally, changes in the broader economic environment could cause changes to our estimated discount rates or comparable company valuation indicators, which may impact our estimated fair values.
for our other six reporting units, their estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 15 percent.

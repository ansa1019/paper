item 1a.   risk factors

we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. if any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. if we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities.
construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials, in a challenging environment, and often in geographically remote locations. on many sites, we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, our employees and others may become injured, disabled or even lose their lives, the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed, and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations. unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, and raise our operating costs. any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
in addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and/or criminal liabilities. we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental ("hse") work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. in addition, despite the work of our functional groups, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work, equipment or supplies.
our safety record is critical to our reputation. many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. accordingly, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns and times of political uncertainty.
we provide technical, professional, construction, and o&m services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration, production, and refining; programs for various national governments, including the u.s. federal government; chemicals and polymers; mining and minerals; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; buildings; power; and other, general industrial and consumer businesses and markets (such as technology and manufacturing; pulp and paper; and food and consumer products). these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty.
current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients' ability and willingness to fund their projects, including their ability to raise capital and pay, or timely pay, our invoices. they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms, and otherwise slow their spending on our services. for example, in the public sector, declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. in addition, due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. these conditions have reduced, and may continue to reduce, the demand for our services, which has had, and may continue to have, a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. for example, following the recent u.s. elections, many observers page 16
expect spending on u.s. infrastructure to increase significantly. there is no assurance that such spending will occur or that the company will benefit from any increase in spending. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients' markets. in addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions, a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending, or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
regardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients' markets and investment decisions. as a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate.
fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers' investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards.
commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. for example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. furthermore, declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices, such as the middle east. to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services.
if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards, we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations. our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability, and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage, and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. further, even where coverage applies, the policies have deductibles, which result in our assumption of exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any claim filed by us. in addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. an uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we engage in a highly competitive business. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
we face intense competition to provide technical, professional, and construction services to clients. the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional, national, and multinational companies.
the extent of our competition varies by industry, geographic market, and project type. for example, with respect to our construction, and operations and maintenance services, clients generally award large projects to large contractors, which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects. conversely, with respect to our engineering, design, architectural, and consulting services, low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller, newer competitors. the extent and type of competition varies by market and geographic area.
page 17
our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process, which is standard in our industry. we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing, schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services. competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us, thereby increasing the risk that, among other things, we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we've seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past. if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts.
our revenues are derived from new contract awards. delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such prospects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, governmental and environmental approvals. since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. furthermore, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project.
in addition, many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer. as a result, we may incur significant costs for engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer.
the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. in some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business. since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project. such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients' projects. we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. in many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses, and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. in addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us.
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. our insurance programs have varying exclusions for matters such as fraud, coverage limits and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. in addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under these programs. as a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured.
although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. for example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, coverage that is more limited, or increased premium costs or deductibles. we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. if any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our page 18
coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted.
in addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors, and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. similarly, we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients, subcontractors, and vendors for, among other things, additional costs exceeding the original contract price. if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors, and vendors, we could incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. further, these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or litigation proceedings, which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims. a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant.
litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subject us to risks of cost overruns. we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates.
for fiscal 2016, approximately 18% of our revenues were earned under fixed-price contracts. such contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance. in addition, we may enter into guaranteed maximum price contracts where we guarantee a price or delivery date. for fixed-price contracts, we may benefit from any cost-savings, but we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. fixed-price contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. if these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather or other delays beyond our control, changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials, our vendors' or subcontractors' inability or failure to perform, or changes in general economic conditions, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. these risks are exacerbated for projects with long-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. if the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted. like fixed-price contracts, the expected cost of cost-reimbursable projects are based in part on our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts. if we are unable to properly support the costs we incur or otherwise fail to obtain proper reimbursement for all costs incurred - for whatever reason - the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses. additionally, we may be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel.
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel, and corporate management professionals at a reasonable cost who have the required experience and expertise. the market for these and other personnel is competitive. from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise, and in the timeframe, demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. in certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. furthermore, some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. if we were to lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects.
page 19
in addition, in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans, which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. for example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. if an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.
the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, cancelled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins.
backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. as of the end of fiscal 2016, our backlog totaled approximately $18.8 billion. there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client. in the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices.
the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates. additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability.
in some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall safety performance, overall client satisfaction, and other performance criteria. if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past.
contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance.
contracts with the u.s. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits. contracts with the u.s. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding. governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take more than one year. as a result, contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated, and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts.
our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the u.s. federal government represented approximately 21.4% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016 ), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. the u.s. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage page 20
in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.
in addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. for example, for contracts with the u.s. federal government, we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation, the truth in negotiations act, the cost accounting standards, the service contract act, and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices. government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. this includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations.
we also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. for example, government agencies such as the u.s. defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies.
if we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. for example, in so-called "qui tam" actions brought by individuals or the government under the u.s. federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded.  in addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed.  the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts. to the extent this occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.
as is common in our industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. this situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients.
we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including the nonperformance, default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. if these circumstances occur, we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages, provide additional services, or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. under agreements with joint and several liabilities, we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners. differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures. in addition, in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement. if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights, we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities.
we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. in these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
page 21
the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts.
third-party subcontractors we hire perform much of the work performed under our contracts. we also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. if we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. if a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, we may be required to source these services, equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability. there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract. in addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications.
in the current economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party's ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. in addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems, adversely affecting our cost of borrowing and our business.
although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. instability in the credit markets in the u.s. or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us. we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. in addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients' ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
in addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.
some of our customers, suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations. disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients' ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. in addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects, may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice. in addition, any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could page 22
increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules. these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
in addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices. in weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, our clients' unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital. if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.
furthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america, europe, south america, australia and asia. some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is a risk that such events may occur in the future. if any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash, which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts.
in line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety's sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the company's credit-worthiness. because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. in addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
past and future environmental, heath, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities.
we are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety. these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities.
various u.s. federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. the liability under these laws is joint and several. we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
when we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. we may be subject to liability claims by employees, customers, and third parties as a result of such exposures. in addition, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. a claim, if not covered or only partially covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
health safety, and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could page 23
negatively impact our revenue. changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. if we fail to comply with any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, we could be exposed to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which may require us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state, and local government permits and approvals. any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.
if we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected.
we are subject to u.s. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. for example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders. although we have policies and procedures to comply with u.s. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in u.s. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business.
employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.
misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, regulations pertaining to export control, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations. for example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance, and suspension or debarment from contracting, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we could be adversely affected by violations of the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.
the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), the u.k. bribery act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us.
a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. for example, in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately page 24
21.4%, 21.7%, and 17.8%, respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the u.s. federal government. although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay, or cancel their contracts at any time. our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies.
for fiscal 2016, approximately 43.0% of our revenue was earned from clients outside the u.s. our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:
•   recessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries;

•   difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including logistical and communication challenges;

•   unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements;

•   potential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, export control and anti-boycott laws and similar non-u.s. laws and regulations;

•   lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights;

•   expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country;

•   renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts;

•   the adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions;

•   embargoes;

•   changes in labor conditions;

•   acts of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism;

•   the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations;

•   social, political, and economic instability;

•   expropriation of property;

•   tax increases;

•   currency exchanges rate fluctuations;

•   limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and

•   u.s. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate, including embargoes or other trade restrictions.

the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. in addition, military action or continued unrest, particularly in the middle east, could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere. to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.
we work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost.
some of our services are performed in high-risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. in those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors. acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our page 25
operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of key employees, contractors or assets.
foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects.
our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, into the u.s. dollar. while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. these actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency. based on fluctuations in currency, the u.s. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries.
our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom's proposed exit from the european union.
in june 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as "brexit." as a result of the referendum, there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the u.k. and e.u. countries and increased regulatory complexities. these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers, employees, and subcontractors, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. brexit may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs, terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts, decrease or postpone currently planned contracts, or negotiate for more favorable deal terms, each of which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth. acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties.
our business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of other companies. acquiring companies presents a number of risks, including:
•   assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated;

•   valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business;

•   failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;

•   difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business;

•   the effects of diverting management's attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies;

•   potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations;

•   potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or post-acquisition deterioration in an acquired business;

•   difficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities;

•   difficulties retaining key personnel of an acquired business;

•   increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities;

•   difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business;

page 26
•   increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls; and

•   the potential requirement for additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available, or if available, may not have favorable terms.

while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds, and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity.
if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy, our operating results could be harmed. in addition, even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability.
in addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions. future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all.  acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced.
in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership.
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. if we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders' individual ownership percentages in the company.
our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock.
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock. fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including:
•   fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers;

•   the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter;

•   unanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits;

•   the timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments;

•   delays incurred in connection with a project;

•   changes in prices of commodities or other supplies;

•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates;

•   weather conditions that delay work at project sites;

•   the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives;

•   the decision by the board of directors to begin or cease paying a dividend, and the expectation that if the company pays dividends, it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future;

•   natural disasters or other crises;

•   staff levels and utilization rates;

•   changes in prices of services offered by our competitors; and

•   general economic and political conditions.

page 27
our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements.
in preparing our financial statements, our management is required under u.s. gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:
•   recognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting;

•   estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;

•   recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;

•   collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts;

•   estimates of other liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves and reserves necessary for self-insured risks;

•   accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves;

•   valuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions;

•   valuation of stock-based compensation;

•   the determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and

•   income tax provisions and related valuation allowances.

our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
we may be adversely impacted by, or unable to fully realize the benefits of, our corporate reorganization.
in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we reorganized the company's operating units into four lines of business, each of which is a separate reportable segment. we may be unable to realize the anticipated longer term efficiency benefits of the reorganization.  furthermore, our reorganization into four reportable segments, which also represent the company's reporting units, may have a material impact on the risk that an impairment charge of goodwill will occur.  in the past, with a single reportable segment the company had two reporting units. following the reorganization, our number of reporting units has increased to four reporting units. our goodwill was allocated amongst the new reporting units, for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, on the basis of enterprise fair values. this allocation of goodwill to the four new reporting units could make it more likely that the company will have an impairment charge in the future, in circumstances where an impairment charge may not have been necessary prior to the reorganization. an impairment charge to one of our reporting units could have an impact on our results of operations.
an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. under u.s. gaap, we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. as of september 30, 2016, we had $3.1 billion of goodwill, representing 41.8% of our total assets of $7.4 billion. we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit's market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities, and other factors.
if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. the page 28
amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see item 7- management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below.
we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage.
we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. for example, as of september 30, 2016 and october 2, 2015, our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $403.1 million and $413.1 million, respectively. see note 6- pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional disclosure. in the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
rising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts.
rising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. in addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 82% during fiscal 2016), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. however, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.
growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. for example, there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning, among other things, greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients. legislation, international protocols, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. however, these changes could also increase the pace of projects, such as carbon capture or storage projects, that could have a positive impact on our business. we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers.
our effective tax rate may increase or decrease.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are regularly under audit by tax authorities. although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm.
we rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. from time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other page 29
steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. in addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property, and results of operations, as well as those of our clients.
in addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients' proprietary or classified information. we rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to these threats. as a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. and, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have an adverse effect on our business.
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients.
our technology and intellectual property provide us, in certain instances, with a competitive advantage. although we protect our property through patent registrations, license restrictions, and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the u.s. if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business.
in addition, if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies.
our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.
extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. as an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. if we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects page 30
are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. in addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits.
we are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages.
we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. for example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. in addition, our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards, licensing requirements, securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed. we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties.
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.
we are a delaware corporation. certain anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. in addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. for example:
•   only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board;

•   there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and

•   our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.

these types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, a reader of this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long-term engineering and construction-type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity's results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 - significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k, the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures -in general, we recognize revenues at the time we provide services. depending on the commercial terms of the contract, we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred, or using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress as of the balance sheet dates. in making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate the possible effects of variances in schedule, the costs of materials and labor, productivity, and the impact of change orders, claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance standards. many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. for contracts containing incentive fee arrangements, fees are frequently based on achievement of target completion dates, target costs, and/or other performance criteria. failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues recognized from the project.
we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion. for multiple contracts with a single customer, we account for each contract separately.
the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible. in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract, we include in the total estimated costs of the contract (and therefore, the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract) an estimate, based on all relevant facts and circumstances available, of the additional costs to be incurred. similarly, and in the normal course of business, we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible. in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients, we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred, without profit, to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated. costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims.
certain cost-reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as many commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment. in this situation, revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts. in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract, we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly.
as is common to the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums. although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients, the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners, or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures. the assets of our joint ventures, therefore, consist almost entirely of cash and receivables (representing amounts due from clients), and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners (for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts) and other subcontractors. in general, at any given time, the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients. very few of our joint ventures have employees. none of our joint ventures have third-party debt or credit facilities. our joint ventures, therefore, are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients. generally they do not, in and of themselves, present any risk of loss to us or to our partners page 36
separate from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own. we may, however, be exposed to additional risk through the use of joint ventures. see item 1a - risk factors above.  under u.s. gaap, our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures, if and when they occur, has always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
in evaluating the company's joint ventures (also referred to as "variable interest entities", or "vies") for accounting and consolidation purposes, we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not the company has a "controlling financial interest" in the vie. the company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has (i) the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance; and (ii) the right to receive benefits, or obligation to absorb losses, that could potentially be significant to the vie. in making our qualitative analysis, the company assesses each vie to determine those activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and whether the company, another entity, or multiple entities have the power to direct those activities.
if we determine that we have the power to direct those activities of the vie that most significantly impact its financial performance and have the right or obligation to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie, then we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and we consolidate the vie. if we determine that we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie or power is shared by two or more unrelated parties, then we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the vie.
for the company's unconsolidated joint ventures, we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional consolidation. the company does not currently participate in any significant vies in which it has a controlling financial interest. there were no changes in facts and circumstances in the period that caused the company to reassess the method of accounting for its vies.
accounting for stock issued to employees and others - we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the award. we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the black-scholes option-pricing model. like all option-pricing models, the black-scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including (i) the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock, and (ii) the expected term of the award, among others. accordingly, changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards. for restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions with measures external to the company, compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units determined using monte carlo simulations.
accounting for pension plans - the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans' assets and liabilities. these assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 7 - pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k.
the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2017 range from 3.5% to 8.5% compared to 3.5% to 8.5% for the prior year. we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2017 reflects the long-term returns expected on the plans' assets, considering recent market conditions, projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans' assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 1.6% to 7.8% in fiscal 2015 to a range of 0.7% to 7.0% in fiscal 2016. these assumptions represent the company's best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled.
changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. for example, if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation ("pbo") at september 30, 2016, was higher (lower) by 0.5%, the pbo would have been lower (higher) at that date by approximately $124.4 million for non-u.s. plans, and by approximately $9.1 million for u.s. plans. if the expected return on plan assets was higher (lower) by 1.0%, the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2017 would be lower (higher) by approximately $10.0 million for non-u.s. plans, and by approximately $1.3 million for u.s. plans. differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance (i.e., actuarial gains and losses) that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with u.s. gaap. management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used.

contractual guarantees, litigation, investigations, and insurance - in the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance. most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers' compensation; personal injury; environmental; employment/labor; professional liability; and other similar lawsuits. we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. we have elected, however, to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs. this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured, and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts.
in accordance with u.s. gaap, we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees, litigation, and insurance claims. we include any adjustments to such liabilities in our consolidated results of operations.
in addition, as a contractor providing services to the u.s. federal government and several of its agencies, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the u.s. federal government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations, and procurement practices. we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations.
testing goodwill for possible impairment - the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment. in performing the annual impairment test, we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level. the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year. the company will test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we reorganized our operations around four global lines of business. the four global lines, which represent our reporting units, are: petroleum & chemicals, buildings & infrastructure, aerospace & technology, and industrial.   previously, the company had two reporting units "europe" and "non-europe".
in conjunction with the aforementioned reorganization, we performed a quantitative impairment test and we allocated goodwill among our new reporting units based on the relative fair value of the four reporting units. as a result, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for each of the company's reporting units (both immediately before and after the reorganization). based on this quantitative assessment, the fair value of each of the reporting units (pre and post reorganization) exceeded their respective net book values, and accordingly, no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the reorganization.
u.s. gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units. the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others.
we used both an income approach and a market approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment. such approaches require us to make estimates and judgments. under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units. the company's discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital ("wacc") for a peer group of companies representative of the company's respective reporting units.  under the market approach, the fair value of our reporting units is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units; the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies. in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired, we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated. the fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values ranging from 28% to 90%.
it is possible that changes in market conditions, economy, facts and circumstances, judgments, and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change, resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future. the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties.
in performing the company's annual impairment test as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016 the company performed a qualitative assessment, and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts. as a result, the company is not required to proceed to a quantitative impairment assessment.

we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for the balance sheets presented.
fiscal 2016
during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we reorganized our operating and reporting structure around four lines of business ("lob"). this reorganization is intended to better serve our global clients, leverage our workforce, help streamline operations, and provide enhanced growth opportunities. the four global lobs are: petroleum & chemicals, buildings & infrastructure, aerospace & technology, and industrial. previously, the company operated its business as a single segment.
the 2015 restructuring and other events affecting fiscal 2016
during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the company commenced a series of initiatives intended to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and better position itself to drive growth of the business in the future (the " 2015 restructuring"). the 2015 restructuring was not completed in fiscal 2015, and actions related to the 2015 restructuring continued throughout fiscal 2016.  actions related to the 2015 restructuring completed during the fiscal year include involuntary terminations, the abandonment of certain leased offices, combining operational organizations, and the co-location of employees into other existing offices.  the company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 include a $187.9 million pre-tax impact relating to costs associated with the 2015 restructuring.  the majority of the costs of the 2015 restructuring are included in selling, general, and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.
the company previously announced on july 15, 2016 that it had sold its jacobs france subsidiary.  the sale is part of the company's strategy to streamline our overall operational efficiency in regions that fit within our target markets and geographies.  the loss on the sale of our french subsidiary was $17.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share.
in addition to the 2015 restructuring and the sale of our french subsidiary, the company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 also include a non-cash write-off on an equity investment of $10.4 million, or $0.09 per share.  the write off of the equity investment and the loss on sale of our french subsidiary are included in loss on disposal of business and investments on the consolidated statements of earnings.
the following table summarizes the effects of the 2015 restructuring and other events on the company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015 (in thousands, except for earnings per share):

the 2015 inter-company debt refinancing during the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the company completed the refinancing of certain international inter-company debt (the "2015 inter-company debt refinancing"). the 2015 inter-company debt refinancing resulted in a one-time tax benefit of $23.1 million, or $0.18 per share.
2016 overview the company's gaap net earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased by $92.5 million, or 30.5%, when compared to fiscal 2015. the company's results for fiscal 2016 when compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by the 2015 restructuring, the loss on sale of our french subsidiary of $17.1 million, and the non-cash write-off on an equity investment of $10.4 million mentioned above.  excluding the effects of the 2015 restructuring and these other events, the company's adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased by $37.3 million, or 9.1%, compared to the prior year.
also influencing the comparability of the company's fiscal 2016 consolidated results to fiscal 2015 were (i) a $0.09 per diluted share tax benefit related to an international tax matter recorded in first quarter of fiscal 2016;  (ii) a $0.03 net benefit per diluted share benefit related to several items, including the release of a foreign tax reserve and a one-time benefit in noncontrolling interests relating to certain work performed by one of our partially owned subsidiaries; partially off-set by the impact of a customer bankruptcy and a litigation settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2016; (iii) a one-time tax related and other items of $4.1 million, or $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016; and (iv) a one-time tax benefit of $23.1 million, or $0.18 per share related to the 2015 inter-company debt refinancing recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
backlog at september 30, 2016 was $18.8 billion, and is essentially flat year over year. backlog remains near record levels despite the negative effects on backlog stemming from the effects of foreign exchange rate changes.  new prospects and new sales remain strong and the company continues to have a positive outlook for many of the industry groups and markets in which our clients operate.
during fiscal 2016, the company repurchased and retired 3.4 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program. total cash spent for the shares repurchased during fiscal 2016 was $152.5 million. as of october 2, 2015, the company exhausted the $500 million approved by the board of directors on august 19, 2014. on july 23, 2015, the board of directors approved another program to purchase an additional $500 million of the company's common stock over the next three years.  at the end of fiscal 2016, $347.5 million remained available under the current plan.
business combinations completed between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2016
during fiscal year 2016, the company acquired j.l. patterson & associates and the van dyke technology group, inc. these acquisitions were not material to the company's consolidated results for fiscal 2016.
we also completed a number of other acquisitions during fiscal 2014 including federal network systems llc ("fns", formerly a subsidiary of verizon); eagleton engineering, llc; fmhc corporation; stobbarts (nuclear) limited; trompeter enterprises; and marmac field services, inc. the results of operations of these other acquisitions were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014. during fiscal 2014, we also acquired an additional 15% interest in jacobs, zamel and turbag consulting engineers company ("zate"). this transaction brought the company's ownership in zate to 75%.
page 40
consistent with other business combinations we have completed in the past, we began integrating businesses we acquired last year into our existing operations almost immediately after each business was acquired. accordingly, it is not practicable to provide complete financial information for fiscal 2016 on a stand-alone basis for any of the businesses we acquired last year.
results of operations during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we reorganized our operating and reporting structure around four lines of business ("lob").  this reorganization is intended to better serve our global clients, leverage our workforce, help streamline operations, and provide enhanced growth opportunities.  the four global lobs are: petroleum & chemicals, buildings & infrastructure, aerospace & technology, and industrial, which are the company's reportable segments. previously, the company operated its business as a single segment.
reconciliation of segment operating profit to total operating profit the following table reconciles segment operating profit to total operating profit by including certain corporate-level items (in thousands).
2016                                                2015                      2014

unallocated corporate items           (60,100   )               (15,739   )               20,583
restructuring charges                (187,630   )              (154,283   )              (93,330   )
total operating profit               $338,598                  $445,527                 $528,068
included in "unallocated corporate items" in the above table are costs and expenses, which relate to general corporate activities as well as corporate-managed benefit and insurance programs.  such costs and expenses include: (i) those elements of sg&a expenses relating to the business as a whole; (ii) those elements of the company's cash and equity incentive plans relating to corporate personnel whose other compensation costs are not allocated to the lobs; (iii) the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of purchased business combinations; (iv) the quarterly variances between the company's actual costs of certain of its self-insured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the lobs; and (v) certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the company's international defined benefit pension plans.  in addition, "unallocated corporate items" includes adjustments to contract margins (both positive and negative) associated with projects where it has been determined, in the opinion of management, that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related lob and therefore should not be attributed to the lob.
segment operating results in evaluating the company's performance by operating segment, the chief operating decision maker reviews various metrics and statistical data for each lob but focuses primarily on revenues and operating profit.  as discussed above, segment operating profit includes not only local sg&a expenses but also the sg&a expenses of the company's support groups that have been allocated to the segments.  in addition, the company allocates portions of the company's cash and equity incentive plans to the lobs.  the revenues of certain lobs are more affected by pass-through revenues than other lobs.  the methods for recognizing revenue, incentive fees, project losses, and change orders are consistent among the lobs.

aerospace & technology revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30, 2016  decreased $267.3 million, or 9.1%, to $2.7 billion from $2.9 billion in fiscal 2015.  the decrease was due in part to some of our u.s. government customers' shift to a small-business preference in contract awards, which was partially mitigated by stronger revenues in our u.k. nuclear and defense markets.
page 41
aerospace & technology revenues for the year ended october 2, 2015 increased $618.3 million, or 26.8%, to $2.9 billion from $2.3 billion in fiscal 2014.  the increase was primarily due to the fns acquisition completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
operating profit for the year ended september 30, 2016  decreased $1.6 million, or 0.8% to $203.8 million from $205.4 million in fiscal 2015.   the slight decrease in operating profit was due to lower volumes in fiscal 2016 described above but was mostly mitigated by improving our performance on fixed price contracts.  operating margin for fiscal 2016, improved to 7.7%, compared to 7.0%, respectively, in fiscal 2015.  the improvement in operating margin was due to additional fees on our nuclear work for the u.k. government, the replacement of lower margin work with higher margin contracts and our continued focus on overall profitability.
operating profit for the year ended october 2, 2015 increased $65.7 million, or 47.0% to $205.4 million from $139.7 million, in fiscal 2014. the increase in operating profit was due primarily to the acquisition described above and an increase in nuclear and defense work in the u.k.  as a result, operating margin for the year ended october 2, 2015, improved to 7.0%, compared to 6.1%, in fiscal 2014.

buildings & infrastructure revenues for the year ended september 30, 2016 decreased $204.9 million, or 8.3%, to $2.3 billion from $2.5 billion in fiscal 2015.  the decrease was primarily due to reduced u.s. and u.k. client spending in certain markets during fiscal 2016.
buildings & infrastructure revenues for the year ended october 2, 2015 decreased $246.8 million, or 9.1%, to $2.5 billion from $2.7 billion in fiscal 2014.  the decrease was primarily due to the decline in our energy and power business in the asia pacific region.
operating profit for the year ended september 30, 2016  increased $29.3 million, or 20.2%, from $145.3 million in fiscal 2015 to $174.6 million.    proactive cost control and restructuring efforts contributed to the increase in operating profit for fiscal 2016 as compared to the corresponding period last year.  as a result, operating margin for fiscal 2016 improved to 7.8%, compared to 5.9%, in fiscal 2015.
operating profit for the year ended october 2, 2015 decreased $19.1 million, or 11.6% to $145.3 million from $164.4 million in fiscal 2014.  the decrease in operating profit was due to the decline in energy and power business.  as a result, operating margin for the year ended october 2, 2015, declined to 5.9%, compared to 6.1%, in fiscal 2014.

operating profit           81,268               126,531               134,230
industrial revenues for the year ended september 30, 2016 increased $276.1 million, or 11.0%, to $2.8 billion from $2.5 billion in fiscal 2015.  the increase was primarily due to new life sciences projects offset by a decline in the mining & minerals business due to weak market conditions.
industrial revenues for the year ended october 2, 2015 decreased $438.8 million, or 14.8%, to $2.5 billion from $3.0 billion in fiscal 2014.  the decrease was primarily due to a decline in the mining & minerals and field services business due to weak market conditions.
page 42
operating profit for the year ended september 30, 2016 decreased $45.3 million, or 35.8% to $81.3 million from $126.5 million, in fiscal 2015.   the decrease was due to the decline in the mining & minerals business and was caused primarily by a negotiated settlement of a project claim that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 combined with the negative effects of a litigation settlement affecting the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and a customer bankruptcy. these decreases were offset in part by the increases in the life sciences market and benefits associated with the 2015 restructuring. although driven by discrete items in each of the periods presented, the change in operating profit was negative.  as a result, operating margin for fiscal 2016 declined to 2.9% from 5.0% for the corresponding period last year.
operating profit for the year ended october 2, 2015 decreased $7.7 million, or 5.7% to $126.5 million from $134.2 million, in fiscal 2014.   the decrease in operating profit was due to the decline in the mining & minerals business driven by lower revenues as a result of weak market conditions.  operating margin for the year ended october 2, 2015 increased to 5.0%, compared to 4.5%, in fiscal 2014.  the decrease in operating margin was driven primarily by a better project mix in the specialty chemical & manufacturing markets and lower pass through revenue in field services.

revenue                 $3,259,499            $4,214,129            $4,727,116

petroleum & chemicals revenues for the year ended september 30, 2016 decreased  $954.6 million, or 22.7%, to $3.3 billion from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2015.  petroleum & chemicals revenues for the year ended october 2, 2015 decreased $513.0 million, or 10.9%, to $4.2 billion from $4.7 billion in fiscal 2014.  the decrease in both comparable annual periods was primarily due to lower business volume in the oil & gas market sector and to a lesser extent the refining market sector, particularly in the middle east and north america, as weak oil prices have significantly impacted client capital spending and delayed the pace of new contract awards.
operating profit for the year ended september 30, 2016 decreased $11.7 million, or 8.5%, to $126.6 million from $138.4 million in fiscal 2015. the decrease in operating profit was due to lower volume in the oil and gas and refining market sectors offset in part by significant savings from restructuring efforts and lob structure efficiencies. a continued strong focus on cost reductions has partially mitigated the volume reduction impact on operating profit.   as a result, operating margin for the year ended september 30, 2016 increased to 3.9% from 3.3% in fiscal 2015.
operating profit for the year ended october 2, 2015 decreased $24.1 million, or 14.8% to $138.4 million from $162.5 million, in fiscal 2014.   the decrease in operating profit was due to lower business volume partially offset by restructuring actions to lower the lob cost structure.  as a result, operating margin for the year ended october 2, 2015, declined to 3.3%, compared to 3.4% in fiscal 2014.
consolidated results fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015
direct costs of contracts decreased $1.0 billion, or 9.4%, from $10.1 billion during fiscal 2015 to $9.2 billion during fiscal 2016. direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts, including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects. the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of pass-through costs we incur during a period. on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment, we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs (and we refer to such costs as "pass-through costs"). on other projects, where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items, these amounts are not considered pass-through costs and are, therefore, not reflected in either revenues or costs. to the extent that we incur a significant amount of pass-through costs in a period, our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well.  the decrease in direct costs of contracts between fiscal years 2015 and 2016 is primarily a result of the general decline in our business.
pass-through costs decreased $112.7 million, or 4.3%, from $2.6 billion during fiscal 2015 to $2.5 billion for fiscal 2016. in general, pass-through costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities.
page 43
pass-through costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients' projects. however, because we have hundreds of projects, which start at various times within a fiscal year, the effect of pass-through costs on the level of direct costs of contracts, can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business.
as a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 83.9% for fiscal 2016, compared to 83.8% for fiscal 2015. the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided. generally speaking, the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients (i.e., where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects, and/or procure subcontracts in connection with projects) and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical, professional services revenues, the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues. because revenues from pass-through costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit. the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues was flat over the prior year period.  the company experienced a slight decrease in margins in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015.
selling, general, and administrative ("sg&a") expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased by $93.6 million, or 6%, to $1.43 billion, compared to $1.52 billion for fiscal 2015. the decrease in sg&a expenses was primarily due to higher sg&a savings associated with the 2015 restructuring.  excluding the effects of the 2015 restructuring in both fiscal 2016 and 2015, adjusted sg&a expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased $126.9 million, or 9%, to $1.24 billion from $1.37 billion in fiscal 2015.
net interest expense for fiscal 2016 decreased $4.8 million to $7.4 million from $12.2 million in fiscal 2015. included in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 was a reversal of $2.7 million of accrued interest expense related to the statute expiration of a foreign tax reserve.  interest expense for fiscal 2016 was also lower when compared to the same period last year due to lower debt levels.
loss on disposal of business and investments for fiscal 2016  increased by $38.5 million to $41.4 million from $2.9 million in fiscal 2015.  the increase is due to the previously discussed loss on the sale of our french subsidiary of $24.4 million, and a non-cash write-off on an equity investment of $17.0 million.
miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2016 increased $2.8 million to $3.1 million from $0.2 million in fiscal 2015.  the increase over the prior year period was primarily due to realized exchange rate losses.  included in miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2016 was a reversal of $5.1 million of accrued penalties related to the statute expiration of a foreign tax reserve.
the company's effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 increased to 25.2% from 23.5% in fiscal 2015. contributing to the increase in the effective tax rate when compared to the prior year is the absence of a $23.1 million nonrecurring benefit related to a foreign currency loss in 2015.  also contributing to the increase is an $8.9 million charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to a statutory tax rate change in the united kingdom.  offsetting the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate increases was a $11.2 million benefit related to a valuation allowance release, a $6.9 million benefit due to a prior period adjustment to income taxes payable and a $8.7 million benefit recorded upon the filing of a us amended tax return to claim additional foreign tax credits and internal revenue code section 179d benefit for the design of energy efficient buildings.
fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014
the company's gaap net earnings for fiscal 2015 decreased by $25.1 million, or 7.6%, compared to fiscal 2014. included in net earnings for fiscal 2015 is the one-time tax benefit of $23.1 million, or $0.18 per share, related to the 2015 inter-company debt refinancing.
the company's results for fiscal 2015 when compared to the prior year were positively impacted by (i) the skm acquisition, which is included for all of fiscal 2015 compared to approximately nine and a half  months in fiscal 2014 and, to a lesser degree, (ii) the other acquisitions completed during fiscal 2014. also influencing the comparability of the company's fiscal 2015 results of operations to fiscal 2014 were the 2015 restructuring and the 2014 events below:
page 44
•   $6.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, increase to net earnings due to the favorable resolution of an international tax matter in the first quarter of fiscal 2014; as a result of these events, approximately $4.1 million of accrued interest expense was reversed;

•   $6.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, increase to net earnings related to a gain on the sale of certain intellectual property in the second quarter of fiscal 2014;

•   $22.7 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, decrease to net earnings relating to certain specific operational events at skm and skm transaction-related costs and expenses incurred during the first half of the fiscal year; and

•   $22.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, decrease to net earnings due to lower margins associated with certain projects in europe combined with unusual weather effects in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.

revenues decreased $580.3 million, or 4.6%, from $12.7 billion for fiscal 2014 to $12.1 billion for fiscal 2015.  revenues for fiscal year 2015 include a negative impact of $561.0 million related to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar.
direct costs of contracts decreased $474.9 million, or 4.5%, from $10.62 billion during fiscal 2014 to $10.15 billion during fiscal 2015.  pass-through costs decreased $352.2 million, or 11.9%, from $2.95 billion during fiscal 2014 to $2.60 billion for fiscal 2015.
as a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 83.8% for fiscal 2015, compared to 83.7% for fiscal 2014. the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues was flat over the prior year period.
selling, general, and administrative ("sg&a") expenses for fiscal 2015 decreased by $22.9 million, or 1.5%, to $1.52 billion, compared to $1.55 billion for fiscal 2014. the decrease in sg&a expenses was primarily due to lower costs stemming from the 2014 events, which were partially offset by increased costs related to the 2015 restructuring. excluding the effects of the 2015 restructuring and the 2014 events, adjusted sg&a expenses for fiscal 2015 decreased $67.4 million, or 4.7%, to $1.37 billion from $1.44 billion for the corresponding period last year.
net interest expense for fiscal 2015 increased $10.5 million to $12.2 million from $1.7 million in fiscal 2014. included in net interest expense for fiscal 2014 was the reversal of $4.1 million of accrued interest expense recorded in connection with income tax liabilities relating to certain contested international tax matters, which were favorably resolved during the first quarter of fiscal 2014.
page 45
the company's consolidated effective income tax rate was 25.2% for fiscal 2016, compared to 23.5% in fiscal 2015. contributing to the increase in the effective tax rate when compared to the prior year is the absence of a $23.1 million nonrecurring benefit related to foreign currency loss in 2015.  the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate due to an $11.2 million benefit related to a valuation allowance release, a $6.9 million benefit due to a prior period adjustment to income taxes payable and an $8.7 million benefit recorded upon the filing of a us amended tax return to claim additional foreign tax credits and an irc section 179d benefit for the design of energy efficient buildings.  offsetting the current year benefits was an $8.9 million expense charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to a statutory tax rate change in the united kingdom.

(b)   assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal 2017, allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases, but limited to the amount recorded as of september 30, 2016. actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors, including amounts required by local laws and regulations, and other funding requirements.

(c)   assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal 2016, allowing for certain growth. due to the nonqualified nature of the plans, and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service, the payments included in the schedule were limited to the amount recorded as of september 30, 2016.

(d)   represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of september 30, 2016; primarily accounts payable and accrued payroll.

(e)   determined based on borrowings outstanding at the end of fiscal 2016 using the interest rates in effect at that time and, for our outstanding long term debt, concluding with the expiration date of the 2014 facility, as defined below.

backlog information backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. we include in backlog the entire value of contracts at the time the contracts are awarded to us or when we have otherwise been authorized by the client to proceed with the services required by the contracts. with respect to o&m contracts, however, we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. for national government programs (other than u.s. federal o&m contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods. in accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client. in a situation where a client terminates a contract, we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination.  in addition, it is not unusual for clients to change the scope of services required by the contract over the life of the project. accordingly, backlog can fluctuate from one reporting period to the next due to the timing of when new contracts are added to backlog and when the contract revenue is recognized in our consolidated financial statements. many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years).
page 46
please refer to item 1a- risk factors, above, for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts.
the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years (in millions):
backlog:                       2016                    2015                    2014

aerospace &amp; technology                  $5,109,973              $4,880,775              $4,998,844
buildings &amp; infrastructure               5,033,539               4,723,034               4,532,085
industrial                                   3,106,575               3,650,520               2,471,867
petroleum &amp; chemicals                   $5,510,442              $5,552,241               6,377,561
total                                      $18,760,529             $18,806,570             $18,380,357
our backlog at september 30, 2016  decreased by $46 million, or 0.2%, to $18.8 billion from $18.8 billion at october 2, 2015. the decrease in backlog from october 2, 2015 to september 30, 2016 was due primarily to new awards from clients operating in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, offset in part by an approximate $182.6 million reduction due to foreign exchange.
backlog in the aerospace & technology lob at september 30, 2016 was $ 5.11 billion, up $ 229.2 million, or $180.4 million after the effect of exchange rate changes when compared to the backlog at october 2, 2015.  the year-over-year increase in backlog was primarily from an increase in new awards from the u.s. federal government.
backlog in the buildings & infrastructure lob at september 30, 2016 was $5.03 billion, up $310.5 million, or $217.6 million after the effect of exchange rate changes when compared to the backlog at october 2, 2015.  the year-over-year increase in backlog was primarily from new awards in the u.s. buildings and infrastructure market.
backlog in the industrial lob at september 30, 2016 was $3.11 billion, down $543.9 million, or $449.5 million after the effect of exchange rate changes when compared to the backlog at october 2, 2015.  the year-over-year decrease in backlog was primarily related to a lower level of field services awards.
backlog in the petroleum & chemicals lob at september 30, 2016 was $5.51 billion, down $41.8 million, or $5.3 million after the effect of exchange rate changes when compared to the backlog at october 2, 2015.  the year-over-year decrease in backlog was primarily related to weak oil process affecting our customers' capital spend.
backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the u.s. federal government and its agencies totaled approximately $4.8 billion (or 25.4% of total backlog), $4.6 billion (or 23.9% of total backlog), and $3.9 billion (or 22.9% of total backlog) at september 30, 2016, october 2, 2015, and september 26, 2014, respectively. most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year. in general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the u.s. congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts).
we estimate that approximately $7.7 billion, or 41.28%, of total backlog at september 30, 2016 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year.
effects of inflation the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in item 1a- risk factors, and is incorporated herein by reference.
liquidity and capital resources at september 30, 2016, our primary sources of liquidity consisted of $655.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.21 billion of available borrowing capacity under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility (the "2014 facility").
additional information regarding the 2014 facility is set forth in note 6 - borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f-1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we finance as much of our operations and growth as possible through cash generated by our operations.
page 47
during fiscal 2016, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $194.9 million from $460.9 million at october 2, 2015 to $655.7 million at september 30, 2016. this compares to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $271.8 million during fiscal 2015. during fiscal 2016, we experienced net cash inflows of $680.2 million from operating activities offset by outflows of $317.0 million from financing activities, $139.6 million from investing activities, and $28.7 million from the effects of exchange rate changes.
operations provided net cash of $680.2 million during fiscal 2016. this compares to net cash inflows of $484.6 million and $721.7 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. the $195.6 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was due primarily to a $373.1 million favorable change in the company's working capital accounts, partially offset by a $ 114.4 million decrease in net earnings attributable to the group.
because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on cost-plus type contracts, and due to the significance of revenues relating to pass-through costs, most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients. although we continually monitor our accounts receivable, we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total, rather than by the individual elements. the primary elements of the company's working capital accounts are accounts receivable, accounts payable, and billings in excess of cost. accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects, which are generally billable to clients. accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients - a substantial portion of which is for project-related costs. billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred.
this relationship between revenues and costs, and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry, and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level. the $373.1 million increase in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts during fiscal 2016 is indicative of our building momentum to become more effective in our working capital performance.
with respect to the company's trade accounts receivable, while our credit risk could be significant based on the fact that we provide services to clients operating in a wide range of industries as well as in a number of countries outside the u.s., we manage these issues closely to reduce exposures as much as possible and historically have not experienced material losses.  nevertheless, and as disclosed previously, the company incurred a loss during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 relating to the bankruptcy of a client of the industrial lob.  our private sector customers include large, well-known, and well-established multi-national companies, and our government customers consist of national, state, and local agencies located principally in the u.s., the u.k., and australia. although we have not historically experienced significant collection issues with any of our governmental or commercial customers, we are currently reassessing how we extend credit to certain customers and markets that we service.
we used $139.6 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2016. this compares to $96.1 million and $1.5 billion during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in investing activities in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of two small acquisitions in fiscal 2016 and the cash used in the sale of jacobs france subsidiary.   the acquisition activity in fiscal 2014 was primarily related to the company's acquisition of skm for $1.2 billion ($1.1 billion net of cash acquired).
additions to property and equipment totaled $67.7 million, $88.4 million, and $132.1 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. included in fiscal 2015 and 2014 activity are significant expenditures for leasehold improvements relating primarily to the consolidation of certain office space, expansion of office space and relocations of certain office space, all occurring in a number of locations.
our financing activities resulted in net cash outflow of $317.0 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to net cash outflow of $553.3 million and net cash inflow of $304.9 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. the $236.3 million in incremental cash inflow during fiscal 2016 as compared to the previous year was due primarily to a $269.8 million decrease in cash used to repurchased shares of company common stock (discussed in further detail in part ii, item 5 of this annual report on form 10-k).  the $858.2 million in incremental cash outflows during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was due primarily to a $502.7 million increase in cash used to pay-off long-term debt during fiscal 2015, combined with a $343.9 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of company common stock the company had $655.7 million of cash and short-term equivalents at september 30, 2016. of this amount, approximately $149.2 million was held in the u.s. and $506.5 million was held outside of the u.s., primarily in canada, the u.k., and the eurozone. other than the tax cost of repatriating funds held outside the u.s. to the u.s. (see note 10- income page 48

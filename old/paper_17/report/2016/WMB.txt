item 1a. risk factors forward-looking statements and cautionary statement for purposes of the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995
the reports, filings and other public announcements of the williams companies, inc. (williams) may contain or incorporate by reference statements that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts. such statements are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933, as amended (securities act), and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (exchange act). these forward-looking statements relate to anticipated financial performance, management's plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other matters. we make these forward-looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
all statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this report that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as "anticipates," "believes," "seeks," "could," "may," "should," "continues," "estimates," "expects," "forecasts," "intends," "might," "goals," "objectives," "targets," "planned," "potential," "projects," "scheduled," "will," "assumes," "guidance," "outlook," "in service date" or other similar expressions. these forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management and include, among others, statements regarding:
•   levels of cash distributions by williams partners l.p. (wpz) with respect to limited partner interests;
•   levels of dividends to williams stockholders;

•   cash flow from operations or results of operations;
•   seasonality of certain business components;
•   natural gas, natural gas liquids, and olefins prices, supply, and demand;
•   demand for our services.
forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this report. many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:
•   whether wpz will produce sufficient cash flows to provide the level of cash distributions that we expect;
21
•   whether we are able to pay current and expected levels of dividends;
•   whether wpz elects to pay expected levels of cash distributions and we elect to pay expected levels of dividends;
•   whether we will be able to effectively execute our financing plan including the receipt of anticipated levels of proceeds from planned asset sales;
•   whether we will be able to effectively manage the transition in our board of directors and management as well as successfully execute our business restructuring;
•   availability of supplies, including lower than anticipated volumes from third parties served by our midstream business, and market demand;
•   volatility of pricing including the effect of lower than anticipated energy commodity prices and margins;
•   inflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on customers and suppliers);
•   the strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition;
•   whether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and other investment opportunities in accordance with our forecasted capital expenditures budget;
•   our ability to successfully expand our facilities and operations;
•   development of alternative energy sources;
•   availability of adequate insurance coverage and the impact of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions;
•   the impact of existing and future laws, regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental liabilities, and litigation, as well as our ability to obtain permits and achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes;
•   our costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans;
•   changes in maintenance and construction costs;
•   changes in the current geopolitical situation;
•   our exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties;
•   risks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally-recognized credit rating agencies and the availability and cost of capital;
•   the amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate;
22
•   risks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities;
•   acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions;
•   additional risks described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec).
given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. we disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.
in addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. we may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise.
because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. these factors are described in the following section.
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. each of these factors could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and, in some cases our reputation. the occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.
litigation pertaining to the etc merger, including litigation related to energy transfer equity, l.p.'s (ete's) termination of and failure to close the etc merger, may negatively impact our business and operations.
we have incurred and may continue to incur additional costs in connection with the prosecution, defense or settlement of the currently pending and any future litigation relating to the etc merger or ete's termination of and failure to close the etc merger. such litigation includes, among other litigation matters, litigation brought by stockholders of us and unitholders of wpz related to the etc merger and/or williams' termination of the merger agreement with wpz. such litigation also includes the on-going litigation against ete and its affiliates a portion of which is on appeal in the delaware supreme court and in which ete has asserted counterclaims against us. we continue to believe that our lawsuit against ete and its affiliates is an enforcement of our rights under the merger agreement and that this lawsuit is designed to deliver to our stockholders benefits under the merger agreement. we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation. such litigation may also create a distraction for our management team and board of directors and require time and attention. in addition, any litigation relating to the etc merger or ete's termination of and failure to close the etc merger could, among other things, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, including chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk.
we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy or are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns. however, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility,
23
deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. in a low commodity price environment certain of our customers could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress including, in some cases, to file for bankruptcy protection or to renegotiate contracts. to the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with the customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the united states bankruptcy code, or may be renegotiated. further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial conditions. for example, chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates, which accounted for approximately 14 percent of our 2016 consolidated revenues, have experienced significant, negative financial results due to sustained low commodity prices. if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take or are unable to take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
prices for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil, and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial results, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain our existing businesses.
our revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities, and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of current low commodity prices or a further decline in commodity prices. price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. price volatility has and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
the markets for ngls, olefins, natural gas, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including:
•   worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, ngls, olefins, oil, and related commodities;
•   turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions;
•   the activities of the organization of petroleum exporting countries;
•   the level of consumer demand;
•   the price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks;
•   the availability of pipeline capacity;
•   supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions;
•   the price and quantity of foreign imports of natural gas and oil;
•   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;
24
•   the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold.
downgrades of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business.
downgrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. in addition, our ability to access capital markets could continue to be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings.
credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. this analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market, and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. as of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned below investment-grade credit ratings by each of the three credit ratings agencies.
our ability to obtain credit in the future could be affected by wpz's credit ratings.
a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through, and our cash flows are substantially derived from distributions paid to us by, wpz. due to our relationship with wpz, our ability to obtain credit will be affected by wpz's credit ratings. if wpz were to experience a deterioration in its credit standing or financial condition, our access to capital, and our ratings could be adversely affected. any future downgrading of a wpz credit rating could also result in a downgrading of our credit rating. a downgrading of a wpz credit rating could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future upon favorable terms, if at all.
the financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve.
our ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. the amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. we do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. in addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, or the lack of available capital could adversely affect the development and production of additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities and the import and export of natural gas supplies. localized low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. the competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation, and processing facilities.
demand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business.
a failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
25
we may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth.
as part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. we have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. these are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. we may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. if we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner. our growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines, and facilities, ngl transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities.
we also face all the risks associated with construction, including political opposition by landowners, environmental activists, and others resulting in the delay and/or denial of required governmental permits. other construction risks include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that:
•   changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes which are materially different than anticipated;
•   we could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets;
•   we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate;
•   acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial, and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures;
•   acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access capital markets or obtain acceptable terms.
if realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows.
we do not own all of the interests in the partially owned entities, which could adversely affect our ability to operate and control these assets in a manner beneficial to us.
because we do not control the partially owned entities, we may have limited flexibility to control the operation of or cash distributions received from these entities. the partially owned entities' organizational documents generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis; however, in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating the businesses. as of december 31, 2016, our investments in the partially owned entities accounted for approximately 8 percent of our total consolidated assets. conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us, on the one hand, and our partially owned entities, on the other hand, with regard to our partially owned entities' governance, business, or operations. if a conflict of interest arises between us and a partially owned entity, other owners may control the partially owned entity's actions with respect to such matter (subject to certain limitations), which could be detrimental to our business. any future disagreements with the other co-owners of these assets could adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic or industry conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
26
holders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends.
we may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. the actual amount of cash we dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•   the amount of cash that wpz and our other subsidiaries distribute to us;
•   the amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow;
•   the restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements;
•   the cost of acquisitions, if any.
a failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of our stock price.
our cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of wpz.
our partnership interest in wpz is currently our largest cash-generating asset. therefore, we are, at the least, indirectly exposed to all the risks to which wpz is subject and our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the ability of wpz to make distributions to its partners. a significant decline in wpz's earnings and/or distributions would have a corresponding negative impact on us.
we may not be able to sell assets or, if we are able to sell assets, to raise a sufficient amount of capital from such asset sales. in addition, the timing to enter into and close any asset sales could be significantly different than our expected timeline.
we are planning to monetize certain assets held by our subsidiaries in 2017 (including without limitation the geismar olefins facility owned by wpz) to fund additional debt reduction and capital and investment expenditures. given the commodity markets, financial markets, and other challenges currently facing the energy sector, our competitors may also engage in asset sales leading to lower demand for the assets we wish to sell. we may not be able to sell the assets we identify for sale on favorable terms or at all. if we are able to sell assets, the timing of the receipt of the asset sale proceeds may not align with the timing of our capital requirements. a failure to raise sufficient capital from asset sales or a misalignment of the timing of capital raised and capital funding needs could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
an impairment of our assets, including goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings.
gaap requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. the outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments. additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. if we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings.
our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.
we have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. some of our competitors are large oil, natural gas, and petrochemical companies that have greater access to supplies
27
of natural gas and ngls than we do. in addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. similarly, a highly-liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. as a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
we may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow.
we rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and ngls. although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:
•   the level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative fuel sources, such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy;
•   natural gas, ngl, and olefins prices, demand, availability, and margins in our markets. higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems;
•   general economic, financial markets, and industry conditions;
•   the effects of regulation on us, our customers, and our contracting practices;
•   our ability to understand our customers' expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. the results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market.
some of our businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers.
some of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. for instance, pursuant to a compression services agreement, one of our businesses receives a substantial portion of its compression capacity on certain gathering systems from exlp operating llc ("exterran operating"). exterran operating has, until december 31, 2020, the exclusive right to provide compression services on certain gas gathering systems located in wyoming, texas, oklahoma, louisiana, and arkansas, in return for the payment of specified monthly rates for the services provided, subject to an annual escalation provision. if a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. if our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.
28
we will conduct certain operations through joint ventures that may limit our operational flexibility or require us to make additional capital contributions.
some of our operations are conducted through joint venture arrangements, and we may enter additional joint ventures in the future. in a joint venture arrangement, we have less operational flexibility, as actions must be taken in accordance with the applicable governing provisions of the joint venture. in certain cases:
•   we cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to these operations;
•   we are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures;
•   we may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets;
•   we may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest;
•   we have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations.
in addition, joint venture participants may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay substantial carried costs pertaining to the joint venture and to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. the performance and ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations under joint venture arrangements is outside our control. if these third parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, our business may be adversely affected. joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, and disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.
if we fail to make a required capital contribution under the applicable governing provisions of a joint venture arrangements, we could be deemed to be in default under the joint venture agreement. joint venture partners may be permitted to fund any deficiency resulting from our failure to make such capital contribution, which would result in a dilution of our ownership interest, or such joint venture partners may have the option to purchase all of our existing interest in the subject joint venture.
the risks described above or the failure to continue joint ventures, or to resolve disagreements with joint venture partners could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations that are the subject of any joint venture, which could in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions.
there are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, the processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including:
•   aging infrastructure and mechanical problems;
•   damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions;
•   uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), ngls, olefins products, brine, or industrial chemicals;
•   collapse or failure of storage caverns;
29
•   operator error;
•   damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment;
•   pollution and other environmental risks;
•   fires, explosions, craterings, and blowouts;
•   truck and rail loading and unloading;
•   operating in a marine environment.
any of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. the location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. an event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance.
we do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims.
in accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. we currently maintain excess liability insurance with limits of $820 million per occurrence and in the annual aggregate with a $2 million per occurrence deductible. this insurance covers us, our subsidiaries, and certain of our affiliates for legal and contractual liabilities arising out of bodily injury or property damage, including resulting loss of use to third parties. this excess liability insurance includes coverage for sudden and accidental pollution liability for full limits, with the first $135 million of insurance also providing gradual pollution liability coverage for natural gas and ngl operations.
although we maintain property insurance on certain physical assets that we own, lease or are responsible to insure, the policy may not cover the full replacement cost of all damaged assets or the entire amount of business interruption loss we may experience. in addition, certain perils may be excluded from coverage or be sub-limited. we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. we may elect to self-insure a portion of our risks. we do not insure our onshore underground pipelines for physical damage, except at certain locations such as river crossings and compressor stations. offshore assets are covered for property damage when loss is due to a named windstorm event, but coverage for loss caused by a named windstorm is subject to a significant sub-limit and to a large deductible. all of our insurance is subject to deductibles.
in addition, to the insurance coverage described above, we are a member of oil insurance limited (oil), an energy industry mutual insurance company, which provides coverage for damage to our property. as an insured member of oil, we share in the losses among other oil members even if our property is not damaged.
the occurrence of any risks not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to repay our debt.
our assets and operations, as well as our customers' assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena.
our assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers' assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the
30
historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. a significant disruption in our or our customers' operations or a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
given the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store, and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. a terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, ngls, or other commodities. acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions.
we rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. while we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. we could face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, "hacktivists", or private individuals. the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. we could also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information.
breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, could result in damage to our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, or the loss of contracts, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
the natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines, including a reasonable rate of return.
in addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, under the natural gas act of 1938, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the ferc. federal regulation extends to such matters as:
•   transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce;
•   rates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service;
•   certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities;
•   acquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities;
•   accounts and records;
31
•   depreciation and amortization policies;
•   relationships with affiliated companies who are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business;
•   market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas.
regulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business.
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of ngls, processing of olefins, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits.
joint and several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours.
we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. in addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses.
in addition, climate change regulations and the costs associated with the regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) have the potential to affect our business. regulatory actions by the environmental protection agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities, or (iii) administer and manage our ghg compliance program. if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. climate change and ghg regulation could also reduce demand for our services.
32
if third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and ngls or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected.
we depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. if these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or ngl products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed ngls, thereby reducing our revenues. any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
the operation of our businesses might also be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers.
public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations.
certain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. the result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance.
in addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner which differs from prior regulatory action. new laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. if new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
certain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.
our gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. it is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. although most of the services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under ferc policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a "negotiated rate" that may be above or below the ferc regulated cost-based rate for that service. these "negotiated rate" contracts are not generally
33
subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.
our operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis.
revenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. in many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. as a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns.
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.
we do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. as such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. in those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. in addition, some of our facilities cross native american lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. we may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by native american tribes. our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations.
our businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in global financial markets. included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. if financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. in addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over u.s. fiscal and monetary policies. these concerns, as well as actions taken by the u.s. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and u.s. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above.
restrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility.
our total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of december 31, 2016, was $23.41 billion.
the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. in addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our and our material subsidiaries' ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which we will need to comply.
our debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. for example, they could:
•   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;
34
•   impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;
•   diminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally;
•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;
•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.
our ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. if we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. we may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.
our failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. in addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. for more information regarding our debt agreements, please read note 14 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the company's business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism.
in recent years, stockholder activism, including threatened or actual proxy contests, has been directed against numerous public companies, including the company. during the latter part of fiscal year 2016, the company was the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in significant costs to the company. if stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take actions against the company, the company could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, which could have an adverse effect on the company's financial results. stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of the company. such proposals may disrupt the company's business and divert the attention of the company's management and employees; and any perceived uncertainties as to the company's future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, the perception that the company needs a change in the direction of its business, or the perception that the company is unstable or lacks continuity, any or all of which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and may make it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, which could adversely affect the company's business. in addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.
we are experiencing significant change in the composition of our board of directors and senior management.
on june 30, 2016, frank t. macinnis stepped down as chairman of the board and kathleen b. cooper was appointed as chairman of the board. also on june 30, 2016, each of ralph izzo, frank t. macinnis, eric w. mandelblatt, keith a. meister, steven w. nance, and laura a. sugg resigned from the board. on august 28, 2016, the board appointed three new independent directors to the board: stephen w. bergstrom, scott d. sheffield, and william h. spence; on september 23, 2016, the board appointed two additional new independent directors to the board: stephen i. chazen and peter a. ragauss; and on december 5, 2016, the board appointed two more additional new independent
35
directors to the board: charles "casey" cogut and michael a. creel. three of williams former directors, joseph r. cleveland, john a. hagg, and juanita h. hinshaw, determined not to stand for re-election at the company's november 23, 2016 annual meeting. thus, the board is now composed of eleven directors, seven of whom were appointed in the second half of 2016.
on december 13, 2016, the company announced the retirement of senior vice president robert s. purgason, effective january 31, 2017. the company is also executing on a restructuring process, shifting from five operating areas to three, and on february 14, 2017 the company announced the appointment of micheal dunn as executive vice president and chief operating officer.
the changes in composition of the company's board and management impose an additional demand for attention, time and energy of board members and management in connection with orientation and education of new members about the company, including with regard to its business strategies and objectives, assets and operations, and policies and practices, which could distract the board and management from execution of the company's strategy and objectives. additionally, such changes invite new analysis of our business as the new members contribute to the formulation of our business strategies and objectives, which could implicate changes to such strategy and objectives. it is possible that changes to the composition of our board and management could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
institutional knowledge residing with current employees nearing retirement eligibility or with our former employees might not be adequately preserved.
we expect that a significant percentage of employees will become eligible for retirement over the next several years. in addition, as part of an internal restructuring, we recently announced the reduction of five operating areas into three and the closing of our oklahoma city office and the consolidation of employee positions to tulsa or other locations. as employees with significant institutional knowledge reach retirement age, choose not to relocate with us, or their services are otherwise no longer available to us, we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience. in addition, we may not be able to retain or recruit other qualified individuals, and our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate. if knowledge transfer, recruiting, and retention efforts are inadequate, access to significant amounts of knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us.
our hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.
in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into, contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. in these hedging activities, we have used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. for example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract's counterparty credit or performance risk. therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership, williams partners l.p. as such, this subsidiary's operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations.
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of wpz, a publicly traded limited partnership. this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken contractual obligations with respect to wpz as the general partner and to the limited partners of wpz. activities, determined to involve such obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. our control of the general partner of wpz may increase the possibility of claims of breach of such duties, including claims brought due to conflicts of interest (including conflicts
36
of interest that may arise between wpz, on the one hand, and its general partner and that general partner's affiliates, including us, on the other hand). any liability resulting from such claims could be material.
failure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.
certain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the united states. services provided pursuant to these agreements could be disrupted. similarly, the expiration of such agreements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
our costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control.
we have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our u.s. employees and other postretirement benefit plans covering certain eligible participants. the timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws. changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
if there is a determination that the spin-off of wpx energy, inc. (wpx) stock to our stockholders is taxable for u.s. federal income tax purposes because the facts, representations or undertakings underlying a u.s. internal revenue service (irs) private letter ruling or a tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then we and our stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities.
in connection with our original separation plan that called for an initial public offering (ipo) of stock of wpx and a subsequent spin-off of our remaining shares of wpx to our stockholders, we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs and an opinion of our outside tax advisor, to the effect that the distribution by us of wpx shares to our stockholders, and any related restructuring transaction undertaken by us, would not result in recognition for u.s. federal income tax purposes, of income, gain or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the u.s. internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (code), except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx common stock. in addition, we received an opinion from our outside tax advisor to the effect that the spin-off pursuant to our revised separation plan which was ultimately consummated on december 31, 2011, which did not involve an ipo of wpx shares, would not result in the recognition, for federal income tax purposes, of income, gain, or loss to us or our stockholders under section 355 and section 368(a)(1)(d) of the code, except for cash payments made to our stockholders in lieu of fractional shares of wpx. the private letter ruling and opinion have relied on or will rely on certain facts, representations, and undertakings from us and wpx regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. if any of these facts, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or are not otherwise satisfied, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or wpx after the spin-off, or if the irs disagrees with any such facts and representations upon audit, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of our tax advisor and could be subject to significant income tax liabilities.
the spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements that we did not assume in our agreements with wpx.
the spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. a court could deem the spin-off or certain internal restructuring transactions undertaken by us in connection with the separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor
37
insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. a court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations. whether a transaction is a fraudulent conveyance or transfer will vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied. under the separation and distribution agreement between us and wpx, from and after the spin-off, each of wpx and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities, and other obligations related to the business or businesses which each owns and operates. although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to wpx, particularly if wpx were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations.
increases in interest rates could adversely impact our share price, our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels.
interest rates may increase further in the future. as a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. as with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our dividends and implied dividend yield. the distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an energy infrastructure company focused on connecting north america's significant hydrocarbon resource plays to growing markets for natural gas, ngls, and olefins. our operations are located principally in the united states and are organized into the williams partners and williams ngl & petchem services reportable segments. all remaining business activities are included in other.
williams partners williams partners consists of our consolidated master limited partnership, wpz, which includes gas pipeline and midstream businesses. the gas pipeline businesses include interstate natural gas pipelines and pipeline joint project investments; and the midstream businesses provide natural gas gathering, treating, and processing services; ngl production, fractionation, storage, marketing and transportation; deepwater production handling and crude oil transportation services; an olefin production business, and is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries and joint project investments. as of december 31, 2016, we owned approximately 60 percent of the interests in wpz, including the interests of the general partner, which were wholly owned by us, and idrs.
williams partners' gas pipeline businesses consist primarily of transco and northwest pipeline. the gas pipeline business also holds interests in joint venture interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline systems including a 50 percent equity-method investment in gulfstream and a 41 percent interest in constitution (a consolidated entity), which is under development. as of december 31, 2016, transco and northwest pipeline own and operate a combined total of approximately 13,600 miles of pipelines with a total annual throughput of approximately 4,230 tbtu of natural gas and peak-day delivery capacity of approximately 15.5 mmdth of natural gas.
williams partners' midstream businesses primarily consist of (1) natural gas gathering, treating, compression, and processing; (2) ngl fractionation, storage and transportation; (3) crude oil production handling and transportation; and (4) olefins production. (see geismar olefins facility monetization below.) the primary service areas are concentrated in major producing basins in colorado, texas, oklahoma, kansas, new mexico, wyoming, the gulf of mexico, louisiana, pennsylvania, west virginia, new york, and ohio which include the barnett, eagle ford, haynesville, marcellus, niobrara, and utica shale plays as well as the mid-continent region.
the midstream businesses include equity-method investments in natural gas gathering and processing assets and ngl fractionation and transportation assets, including a 62 percent equity-method investment in ueom, a 50 percent equity-method investment in the delaware basin gas gathering system (dbjv) in the mid-continent region, a 69 percent equity-method investment in laurel mountain, a 58 percent equity-method investment in caiman ii, a 60 percent equity-method investment in discovery, a 50 percent equity-method investment in oppl, and appalachia midstream services, llc, which owns an approximate average 41 percent equity-method investment interest in multiple gas gathering systems in the marcellus shale (appalachia midstream investments).
the midstream businesses previously included our canadian midstream operations, which were comprised of an oil sands offgas processing plant near fort mcmurray, alberta and an ngl/olefin fractionation facility at redwater, alberta. in september 2016, these canadian operations were sold. (see note 3 - divestiture of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
williams partners' ongoing strategy is to safely and reliably operate large-scale, interstate natural gas transmission and midstream infrastructures where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. we focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers and investing in growing markets, including the deepwater gulf of mexico, the marcellus shale, the gulf coast region, and areas of increasing natural gas demand.
williams partners' interstate transmission and related storage activities are subject to regulation by the ferc and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion
46
or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. the rates are established through the ferc's ratemaking process. changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have limited near-term impact on these revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates.
williams ngl & petchem services williams ngl & petchem services includes certain domestic olefins pipeline assets as well as the previously owned canadian assets which included a liquids extraction plant near fort mcmurray, alberta, that began operations in march 2016 and a propane dehydrogenation facility under development in canada. in september 2016, these canadian operations were sold. (see note 3 - divestiture of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
unless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii, item 8 of this report.
dividends in december 2016, we paid a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share. on february 20, 2017, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share payable on march 27, 2017, representing a 50 percent increase from our previous quarterly dividend.
overview net income (loss) attributable to the williams companies, inc., for the year ended december 31, 2016, increased $147 million compared to the year ended december 31, 2015, reflecting the absence of certain goodwill impairments, lower impairments of equity-method investments, an increase in olefins margins associated with our geismar plant, decreases in operating and maintenance expenses, and higher equity earnings. these favorable changes were partially offset by an unfavorable change in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests driven primarily by higher wpz income as well as the impact of reduced incentive distributions from wpz associated with the termination of the wpz merger agreement. the favorable changes were also partially offset by increased impairment charges and loss on sale associated with our canadian operations, lower insurance recoveries, as well as higher interest incurred. see additional discussion in results of operations.
acquisition of additional interests in appalachia midstream investments in february, 2017, we announced agreements to acquire additional interests in two marcellus shale gathering systems within williams partners' appalachia midstream investments in exchange for equity-method investment interests in dbjv and the ranch westex gas processing plant, both currently reported within the williams partners segment. we also expect to receive a total of $200 million in cash as part of the agreements subject to customary closing conditions and purchase price adjustments. the transactions are expected to close in late first-quarter or early second-quarter 2017.
financial repositioning in january 2017, we announced agreements with wpz, wherein we permanently waived the general partner's incentive distribution rights and converted our 2 percent general partner interest in wpz to a non-economic interest in exchange for 289 million newly issued wpz common units. pursuant to this agreement, we also purchased approximately 277 thousand wpz common units for $10 million. additionally, we purchased approximately 59 million common units of wpz at a price of $36.08586 per unit in a private placement transaction, funded with proceeds from our equity offering (see note 15 - stockholders' equity of notes to consolidated financial statements). following these transactions, we own a 74 percent limited partner interest in wpz. it is anticipated that the combination of these measures will improve wpz's cost of capital, provide for debt reduction, and eliminate wpz's need to access the public equity markets for several years.
in addition to the previously announced geismar monetization process, we have announced plans to monetize other select assets that are not core to our strategy. we expect to raise more than $2 billion in after-tax proceeds from
47
the monetization process of geismar and the other select assets. as we pursue these other asset monetizations, it is possible that we may incur impairments of certain equity-method investments, property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets. such impairments could potentially be caused by indications of fair value implied through the monetization process or, in the case of asset dispositions that are part of a broader asset group, the impact of the loss of future estimated cash flows.
energy transfer merger agreement on september 28, 2015, we publicly announced in a press release that we had entered into a merger agreement with energy transfer and certain of its affiliates. the merger agreement provided that, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, we would merge with and into the newly formed etc, with etc surviving the etc merger.
on june 29, 2016, energy transfer provided us written notice terminating the merger agreement, citing the alleged failure of certain conditions under the merger agreement.
termination of wpz merger agreement on may 12, 2015, we entered into an agreement for a unit-for-stock transaction whereby we would have acquired all of the publicly held outstanding common units of wpz in exchange for shares of our common stock (wpz merger agreement).
on september 28, 2015, prior to our entry into the merger agreement, we entered into a termination agreement and release (termination agreement), terminating the wpz merger agreement. under the terms of the termination agreement, we were required to pay a $428 million termination fee to wpz, at which time we owned approximately 60 percent, including the interests of the general partner and idrs. such termination fee settled through a reduction of quarterly incentive distributions we were entitled to receive from wpz (such reduction not to exceed $209 million per quarter). the distributions from wpz in november 2015, february 2016, and may 2016 were reduced by $209 million, $209 million, and $10 million, respectively, related to this termination fee.
organizational realignment in september 2016, we announced organizational changes aiming to simplify our structure, increase direct operational alignment to advance our natural gas-focused strategy, and drive continued focus on customer service and execution. effective january 1, 2017, we implemented these changes, which combined the management of certain of our operations and reduced the overall number of operating areas managed within our business.
information in this report has generally been prepared to be consistent with the reportable segment presentation in our consolidated financial statement in part ii, item 8 of this document. these segments are discussed in further detail in the following sections.
williams partners northwest pipeline rate case on january 23, 2017, northwest pipeline filed a stipulation and settlement agreement with the ferc for new rates.  the new rates become effective january 1, 2018, and are not expected to materially affect our trend of earnings.  pursuant to this agreement, northwest pipeline can file for new rates to be effective after october 1, 2018, and must file a general rate case for new rates to become effective no later than january 1, 2023.
geismar olefins facility monetization in september 2016, williams partners announced the initiation of an ongoing process to explore monetization of its ownership interest in the geismar, louisiana, olefins plant and complex, consistent with our strategy to narrow our focus and allocate capital to our natural gas-focused business.

sale of canadian operations in september 2016, we completed the sale of our canadian operations for total consideration of $1.02 billion. we recognized an impairment charge of $747 million during the second quarter of 2016 related to these operations and an additional loss of $66 million upon completion of the sale. (see note 3 - divestiture.)
barnett shale and mid-continent contract restructurings in august 2016, williams partners conditionally committed to execute a new gas gathering agreement in the barnett shale. the agreement was executed in the fourth quarter of 2016, in conjunction with our existing customer, chesapeake energy corporation, closing the sale of its barnett shale properties to another producer. that other producer, which has an investment grade credit rating, is now our customer under the new gas gathering agreement. the restructured agreement provided a $754 million up-front cash payment to us primarily in exchange for eliminating future minimum volume commitments. the restructured agreement also provides for revised gathering rates. based on current commodity price assumptions at the time of the agreement, we generally expect the up-front cash proceeds and the ongoing cash flows generated by gathering services, to represent equivalent net present value of cash flows as compared to expected performance under the existing agreement. additionally, williams partners agreed to a revised contract in the mid-continent region, also with chesapeake energy corporation. the revised contract was executed in the third quarter of 2016 and provided an up-front cash payment to us of $66 million primarily in exchange for changing from a cost of service contract to fixed-fee terms. the majority of the up-front cash proceeds from both agreements were recognized as deferred revenue and will be amortized into income in future periods. in the near term, we do not expect that our trend of reported results will be significantly impacted by the effect of the discount associated with the up-front cash proceeds relative to the original minimum volume commitments and reduced gathering rates. it was anticipated that both agreements would reduce customer concentration risk and provide support to realize additional drilling and improved volumes in these regions.
powder river basin contract restructuring in october 2016, in conjunction with our partner in the bucking horse natural gas processing plant and jackalope gas gathering system, we announced an agreement with chesapeake energy corporation to restructure gathering and processing contracts in the powder river basin. the restructured contracts became effective in january 2017 and replaced the previous cost-of-service arrangement with mvcs in the near-term such that we do not expect that our near-term trend of reported results will be significantly impacted by the restructured terms.
rock springs expansion in august 2016, the rock springs expansion was placed into service. the project expanded transco's existing natural gas transmission system from new jersey to a generation facility in maryland and increased capacity by 192 mdth/d.
gulf trace expansion in february 2017, the gulf trace expansion was placed into service. the project expanded transco's existing natural gas transmission system together with greenfield facilities to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 65 in st. helena parish, louisiana to a new interconnection with sabine pass liquefaction in cameron parish, louisiana. it is expected to increase capacity by 1,200 mdth/d.
redwater expansion in march 2016, we completed the expansion of our redwater facilities in support of a long-term agreement to provide gas processing services to a second bitumen upgrader in canada's oil sands near fort mcmurray, alberta. the expanded redwater facility receives ngl/olefins mixtures from the second bitumen upgrader and fractionates the mixtures into an ethane/ethylene mix, propane, polymer grade propylene, normal butane, an alkylation feed and condensate. we sold these operations in september 2016. (see note 3 - divestiture of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
49
williams ngl & petchem services horizon liquids extraction plant in march 2016, we completed a new liquids extraction plant near fort mcmurray, alberta. the boreal pipeline was extended to enable transportation of the ngl/olefins mixture from the new liquids extraction plant to williams partners' expanded redwater facilities. the plant increased the amount of ngls produced in canada to a total of approximately 40 mbbls/d. to mitigate ethane price risk associated with our processing services, we had a long-term agreement with a minimum price for ethane sales to a third-party customer. we sold these operations in september 2016. (see note 3 - divestiture of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
commodity prices ngl per-unit margins were approximately 7 percent lower in 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. following a sharp decline in late 2014 to early 2015, total ngl margins have remained somewhat consistent in 2015 and 2016. while 2014 and 2015 reflect limited ethane recoveries, we have seen an increase in ethane production during 2016.
ngl margins are defined as ngl revenues less any applicable btu replacement cost, plant fuel, and third-party transportation and fractionation. per-unit ngl margins are calculated based on sales of our own equity volumes at the processing plants. our equity volumes include ngls where we own the rights to the value from ngls recovered at our plants under both "keep-whole" processing agreements, where we have the obligation to replace the lost heating value with natural gas, and "percent-of-liquids" agreements whereby we receive a portion of the extracted liquids with no obligation to replace the lost heating value.
the following graph illustrates the ngl production and sales volumes, as well as the margin differential between ethane and non-ethane products and the relative mix of those products.
the potential impact of commodity prices on our business is further discussed in the following company outlook.
50
company outlook our strategy is to provide large-scale energy infrastructure designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the united states. we accomplish this by connecting the growing demand for cleaner fuels and feedstocks with our major positions in the premier natural gas and natural gas products supply basins. we continue to maintain a strong commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. we believe that accomplishing these goals will position us to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers and an attractive return to our shareholders.
our business plan for 2017 includes the previously announced agreement with wpz to permanently waive our incentive distribution rights in exchange for wpz common units as well as our private purchase of $2.1 billion newly issued wpz commits units. we expect to increase our dividend to $0.30 per share, or $1.20 annually, beginning in the first quarter of 2017. our business plan also includes previously discussed asset monetizations, which include our ownership interest in the geismar olefins facility as well as other select assets that are not core to our strategy. the monetizations are expected to yield after-tax proceeds of greater than $2.0 billion. for wpz, these transactions are expected to improve its cost of capital, remove its need to access the public equity markets for the next several years, enhance growth, and provide for debt reduction, solidifying wpz as an attractive financing vehicle. the transactions are also expected to facilitate a reduction of our parent-level debt and provides for dividend growth flexibility, while retaining strategic and financing flexibility.
our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2017 are expected to total $2.1 billion to $2.8 billion. approximately $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion of our growth capital funding needs include transco expansions and other interstate pipeline growth projects, most of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements. the remaining growth capital spending in 2017 primarily reflects investment in gathering and processing systems in the northeast region limited primarily to known new producer volumes, including volumes that support transco expansion projects including our atlantic sunrise project. in addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments.
as a result of our significant continued capital and investment expenditures on transco expansions and fee-based gathering and processing projects, as well as the previously discussed sale of our canadian operations and the planned monetization of the geismar olefins facility, fee-based businesses are becoming an even more significant component of our portfolio and serve to reduce the influence of commodity price fluctuations on our operating results and cash flows. we expect to benefit as continued growth in demand for low-cost natural gas is driven by increases in lng exports, industrial demand and power generation. current forward market prices indicate a slightly more favorable energy commodity price environment in 2017 as compared to 2016, including higher natural gas and ngl prices. however, some of our customers may continue to curtail or delay drilling plans until there is a more sustained recovery in prices, which may negatively impact our gathering volumes. although there has been some improvement, the credit profiles of certain of our producer customers remain challenged. unfavorable changes in energy commodity prices or the credit profile of our producer customers may also result in noncash impairments of our assets.
in 2017, our operating results will include increases from our fee-based businesses recently placed in service or expected to be placed in service in 2017 primarily along the transco system, a full year benefit of expanded capacity on our gulfstar fpstm, and lower general and administrative expenses due to cost reduction initiatives and asset monetizations. we expect overall gathering and processing volumes to remain steady in 2017 and increase thereafter to meet the growing demand for natural gas and natural gas products.
potential risks and obstacles that could impact the execution of our plan include:
•   opposition to infrastructure projects, including the risk of delay in permits needed for our projects;
•   unexpected significant increases in capital expenditures or delays in capital project execution;
•   counterparty credit and performance risk, including that of chesapeake energy corporation and its affiliates;
51
•   inability to execute or delay in completing planned asset monetizations;
•   lower than anticipated demand for natural gas and natural gas products which could result in lower than expected volumes, energy commodity prices and margins;
•   general economic, financial markets, or further industry downturn, including increased interest rates;
•   physical damages to facilities, including damage to offshore facilities by named windstorms;
•   reduced availability of insurance coverage;
•   lower than expected distributions from wpz.
we seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity, as well as manage a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets which continue to serve key growth markets and supply basins in the united states.
expansion projects our ongoing major expansion projects include the following:
williams partners eagle ford we plan to expand our gathering infrastructure in the eagle ford region in order to meet our customers' production plans. the expansion of the gathering infrastructure includes the addition of new facilities, well connections, and gathering pipeline to the existing systems.
oak grove expansion we plan to expand our processing capacity at our oak grove facility by adding a second 200 mmcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant, which, based on our customers' needs, is expected to be placed into service in 2020.
gathering system expansion we will continue to expand the gathering systems in the marcellus and utica shale regions that are needed to meet our customers' production plans. the expansion of the gathering infrastructure includes additional compression and gathering pipeline to the existing system.
constitution pipeline in december 2014, we received approval from the ferc to construct and operate the jointly owned constitution pipeline, which will have an expected capacity of 650 mdth/d. however, in april 2016, the new york state department of environmental conservation (nysdec) denied a necessary water quality certification for the new york portion of the pipeline. we remain steadfastly committed to the project, and in may 2016, constitution appealed the nysdec's denial of the certification and filed an action in federal court seeking a declaration that the state of new york's authority to exercise permitting jurisdiction over certain other environmental matters is preempted by federal law. (see note 4 - variable interest entities of notes to consolidated financial statements.) we currently own 41 percent of constitution with three other parties holding 25 percent, 24 percent, and 10 percent, respectively. we will be the operator of constitution. the 126-mile constitution pipeline will connect our gathering system in susquehanna county, pennsylvania, to the iroquois gas transmission and tennessee gas pipeline systems in new york, as well as to a local distribution company serving new york and pennsylvania. in light of the nysdec's denial of the water quality certification and the actions taken to challenge the decision, the target in-service date has been revised to as early as the second half of 2018, which assumes that the legal challenge process is satisfactorily and promptly concluded.
52
garden state in april 2016, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 210 in new jersey to a new interconnection on our trenton woodbury lateral in new jersey. the project will be constructed in phases and is expected to increase capacity by 180 mdth/d. we plan to place the initial phase of the project into service during the third quarter of 2017 and the remaining portion in the second quarter of 2018, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.
norphlet project in march 2016, we announced that we have reached an agreement to provide deepwater gas gathering services to the appomattox development in the gulf of mexico. the project will provide offshore gas gathering services to our existing transco lateral, which will provide transmission services onshore to our mobile bay processing facility. we also plan to make modifications to our main pass 261 platform to install an alternate delivery route from the platform, as well as modifications to our mobile bay processing facility. the project is scheduled to go into service during the second quarter of 2020.
hillabee in february 2016, the ferc issued a certificate order for the initial phases of transco's hillabee expansion project. the project involves an expansion of transco's existing natural gas transmission system from station 85 in west central alabama to a proposed new interconnection with the sabal trail project in alabama. the project will be constructed in phases, and all of the project expansion capacity will be leased to sabal trail. we plan to place the initial phase of the project into service concurrent with the in-service date of the sabal trail project, which is planned to occur as early as the second quarter of 2017. the in-service date of the second phase of the project is planned for the second quarter of 2020 and together they are expected to increase capacity by 1,025 mdth/d.
in march 2016, wpz entered into an agreement with the member-sponsors of sabal trail to resolve several matters. in accordance with the agreement, the member-sponsors will pay us an aggregate amount of $240 million in three equal installments as certain milestones of the project are met. the first $80 million payment was received in march 2016 and the second installment was received in september 2016. wpz expects to recognize income associated with these receipts over the term of the capacity lease agreement.
new york bay expansion in july 2016, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from pennsylvania to the rockaway delivery lateral transfer point and the narrows meter station in richmond county, new york. we plan to place the project into service during the fourth quarter of 2017, and it is expected to increase capacity by 115 mdth/d.
atlantic sunrise in february 2017, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system along with greenfield facilities to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from the northeastern marcellus producing area to markets along transco's mainline as far south as station 85 in west central alabama. we expect to place a portion of the project facilities into service during the second half of 2017 and are targeting a full in-service during mid-2018, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. the project is expected to increase capacity by 1,700 mdth/d.
virginia southside ii in july 2016, we received approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system together with greenfield facilities to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 210 in new jersey and station 165 in virginia to a new lateral extending from our brunswick lateral in virginia. we plan
53
to place the project into service during the fourth quarter of 2017 and it is expected to increase capacity by 250 mdth/d.
dalton in august 2016, we obtained approval from the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system together with greenfield facilities to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 210 in new jersey to markets in northwest georgia. we plan to place the project into service in 2017 and it is expected to increase capacity by 448 mdth/d.
gulf connector in august 2016, we filed an application with the ferc to expand transco's existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from station 65 in louisiana to delivery points in wharton and san patricio counties, texas. the project will be constructed in two phases, with the initial phase of the project expected to be in service during the second half of 2018 and the remaining phase in 2019, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. the project is expected to increase capacity by 475 mdth/d.
williams ngl & petchem services gulf coast ngl and olefin infrastructure expansion certain previously acquired liquids pipelines in the gulf coast region are expected to be combined with an organic build-out of several projects to expand our petrochemical services in that region. the projects include the construction and commissioning of pipeline systems capable of transporting various purity natural gas liquids and olefins products in the gulf coast region. in response to the current conditions in the midstream industry, we are slowing the pace of development and may seek partners for these projects.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. we believe that the nature of these estimates and assumptions is material due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations.
pension and postretirement obligations we have employee benefit plans that include pension and other postretirement benefits. net periodic benefit cost and obligations for these plans are impacted by various estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, expected rate of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, and employee demographics, including retirement age and mortality. these assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made as needed. the assumptions utilized to compute cost and the benefit obligations are shown in note 10 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements.
54
the following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in net periodic benefit cost and obligations resulting from a one-percentage-point change in the specific assumption.

our expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, as determined at the beginning of each fiscal year, are based on the average rate of return expected on the funds invested in the plans. we determine our long-term expected rates of return on plan assets using our expectations of capital market results, which include an analysis of historical results as well as forward-looking projections. these capital market expectations are based on a period of at least 10 years and take into account our investment strategy and mix of assets, which are weighted toward domestic and international equity securities. we develop our expectations using input from our third-party independent investment consultant. the forward-looking capital market projections start with current conditions of interest rates, equity pricing, economic growth, and inflation and those are overlaid with forward looking projections of normal inflation, growth, and interest rates to determine expected returns. the capital market return projections for specific asset classes in the investment portfolio are then applied to the relative weightings of the asset classes in the investment portfolio. the resulting rates are an estimate of future results and, thus, likely to be different than actual results.
in 2016, the benefit plans' assets outperformed their respective benchmarks for fixed income strategies, but generally underperformed the respective benchmarks for equity strategies. while the 2016 investment performance was greater than our expected rates of return, the expected rates of return on plan assets are long-term in nature and are not significantly impacted by short-term market performance. changes to our asset allocation would also impact these expected rates of return. our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used for our pension plans was 6.85 percent in 2016. the 2016 actual return on plan assets for our pension plans was approximately 7.5 percent. the 10-year average rate of return on pension plan assets through december 2016 was approximately 3.7 percent.
the discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. the objective of the discount rates is to determine the amount, if invested at the december 31 measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt securities, that will provide the necessary cash flows when benefit payments are due. increases in the discount rates decrease the obligation and, generally, decrease the related cost. the discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined separately based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash flows as described in note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies and note 10 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements. our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term, high-quality debt securities as well as by the duration of our plans' liabilities.
the expected rate of compensation increase represents average long-term salary increases. an increase in this rate causes the pension obligation and cost to increase.
the assumed health care cost trend rates are based on national trend rates adjusted for our actual historical cost rates and plan design. an increase in this rate causes the other postretirement benefit obligation and cost to increase.
55
equity-method investments at the end of the third quarter of 2016, we became aware of changes involving certain of dbjv's customer contracts, which impacted our estimates of dbjv's future cash flows. as such, we evaluated this investment for impairment at september 30, 2016, and determined that no impairment was necessary. we also entered into initial discussions with the system operator regarding the terms and economic assumptions of these contract changes.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, these discussions led to negotiations with the system operator to exchange our interest in dbjv and another equity-method investment in the permian basin (ranch westex) for its interests in certain gathering systems in the northeast and cash. we already hold partial interests in these northeast gathering systems through our appalachia midstream investments. as previously discussed, we reached agreements for such transactions in february 2017.
as part of the preparation of our year-end financial statements, we evaluated the carrying amounts of our investments in dbjv, ranch westex and these certain gathering systems within our appalachia midstream investments for impairment. we also evaluated other equity-method investments within the northeast area for impairment as of december 31, 2016, including other gathering systems within our appalachia midstream investments and our investment in ueom. our impairment evaluations utilized an income approach, but also considered the fair values indicated by the previously described transaction. the estimated fair value of our investment in dbjv exceeded its carrying value and no impairment was necessary. based on the fair value of the consideration expected to be received, we currently expect to recognize a gain upon consummation of the previously described exchange transaction in 2017.
we estimated the fair value of our appalachia midstream investments and ueom using an income approach with discount rates ranging from 10.2 percent to 12.5 percent and also considered the value implied by the previously described transactions as applicable. for certain gathering systems within our appalachia midstream investments, the fair value was determined to be less than our carrying value, resulting in an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $294 million. no impairment was necessary for other gathering systems within our appalachia midstream investments or our investment in ueom. for those investments evaluated for which no impairment was required, our estimate of fair value exceeded our carrying value by amounts ranging from approximately 2.5 percent to 7.5 percent. we estimate that an increase in the discount rate utilized of 50 basis points would have resulted in an additional impairment charge of approximately $45 million. we also recorded an additional impairment of $24 million related to our interest in ranch westex.
judgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimates of future cash flows, discount rates, and market measures utilized. the use of alternate judgments and assumptions could result in a different calculation of fair value, which could ultimately result in the recognition of a different impairment charge in the consolidated financial statements.
at december 31, 2016, our consolidated balance sheet includes approximately $6.7 billion of investments that are accounted for under the equity-method of accounting. we evaluate these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in our management's judgment, that the carrying value of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. we continue to monitor our equity-method investments for any indications that the carrying value may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. when evidence of a loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate of the fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. we generally estimate the fair value of our investments using an income approach where significant judgments and assumptions include expected future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate. in some cases, we may utilize a form of market approach to estimate the fair value of our investments.
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and we consider the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized in the consolidated financial statements as an impairment charge. events or changes in circumstances that may be indicative of an other-than-temporary decline in value will vary by investment, but may include:
•   a significant or sustained decline in the market value of an investee;
•   lower than expected cash distributions from investees;
56
•   significant asset impairments or operating losses recognized by investees;
•   significant delays in or lack of producer development or significant declines in producer volumes in markets served by investees;
•   significant delays in or failure to complete significant growth projects of investees.
constitution pipeline capitalized project costs as of december 31, 2016, property, plant, and equipment - net in our consolidated balance sheet includes approximately $381 million of capitalized project costs for constitution, for which we are the construction manager and own a 41 percent consolidated interest. in december 2014, we received approval from the ferc to construct and operate this jointly owned pipeline. however, in april 2016, the new york state department of environmental conservation (nysdec) denied a necessary water quality certification for the new york portion of the constitution pipeline. we remain steadfastly committed to the project, and in may 2016, constitution appealed the nysdec's denial of the certification and filed an action in federal court seeking a declaration that the state of new york's authority to exercise permitting jurisdiction over certain other environmental matters is preempted by federal law.
as a result of the denial by the nysdec, we evaluated the capitalized project costs for impairment as of march 31, 2016, and as of december 31, 2016, and determined that no impairment was necessary. our evaluation considered probability-weighted scenarios of undiscounted future net cash flows, including a scenario assuming successful resolution with the nysdec and construction of the pipeline, as well as a scenario where the project does not proceed. we continue to monitor the capitalized project costs associated with constitution for potential impairment.

2016 vs. 2015
service revenues increased slightly primarily due to expansion projects placed in service in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by a decrease in gathering, processing, and fractionation revenue primarily due to lower volumes in the barnett shale and anadarko basin.
product sales increased primarily due to higher olefin sales reflecting increased volumes at our geismar plant as a result of the plant operating at higher production levels in 2016, partially offset by a decrease from our other olefin operations associated with lower volumes and per-unit sales prices. product sales also reflect higher marketing revenues associated with higher ngl and propylene prices and natural gas and crude oil volumes, partially offset by lower ngl volumes, and crude oil prices.
the decrease in product costs includes lower olefin feedstock purchases and lower costs associated with other product sales, partially offset by higher marketing purchases primarily due to the same factors that increased marketing sales. the decline in olefin feedstock purchases is primarily associated with lower per-unit feedstock costs and volumes at our other olefin operations, partially offset by an increase in olefin feedstock purchases at our geismar plant reflecting increased volumes resulting from higher production levels in 2016.
operating and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to lower labor-related and outside service costs resulting from our first-quarter 2016 workforce reductions and cost containment efforts and lower costs associated with general maintenance activities in the marcellus shale, as well as the absence of acmp transition-related costs recognized in 2015. these decreases are partially offset by $16 million of severance and related costs recognized in 2016 and higher pipeline testing and general maintenance costs at transco.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to depreciation on new assets placed in service, including transco pipeline projects, partially offset by lower depreciation related to canadian operations sold in 2016.
selling, general, and administrative expenses (sg&a) decreased primarily due to lower merger and transition costs associated with the acmp merger and lower labor-related costs resulting from our first-quarter 2016 workforce reductions and cost containment efforts. these decreases were partially offset by certain project development costs associated with the canadian pdh facility that we began expensing in 2016, as well as $26 million of severance and related costs recognized in 2016 and $17 million of higher costs associated with our evaluation of strategic alternatives.
impairment of goodwill decreased due to the absence of a 2015 impairment charge associated with certain goodwill. (see note 17 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
impairment of certain assets reflects 2016 impairments of our canadian operations and certain mid-continent assets, and other assets. impairments recognized in 2015 relate primarily to previously capitalized development costs and surplus equipment write-downs. (see note 17 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
net insurance recoveries - geismar incident changed unfavorably reflecting the receipt of $126 million of insurance proceeds in the second quarter of 2015, as compared to the receipt of $7 million of proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2016.
the unfavorable change in other (income) expense - net within operating income (loss) includes a loss on the sale of our canadian operations that were sold in september 2016, project development costs at constitution as we discontinued capitalization of these costs in april 2016, and an unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange that primarily relates to losses incurred on foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of the u.s. dollar-denominated current assets and liabilities within our former canadian operations, partially offset by a $10 million gain on the sale of idle pipe in 2016.
operating income (loss) changed favorably primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment in 2015, higher olefin margins related to the geismar plant operating at higher production levels in 2016, lower costs related to the merger and integration of acmp, and lower costs and expenses primarily associated with cost containment efforts.
59
these favorable changes are partially offset by impairments and loss on sale of certain assets in 2016, a decrease in insurance proceeds received, expensed canadian pdh facility project development costs, and higher depreciation expenses related to new projects placed in service.
equity earnings (losses) changed favorably primarily due to a $30 million increase at discovery driven by the completion of the keathley canyon connector in the first quarter of 2015. additionally, oppl, laurel mountain, and dbjv improved $16 million, $11 million, and $10 million, respectively.
impairment of equity-method investments reflects 2016 impairment charges associated with our appalachia midstream investments, dbjv, and laurel mountain equity-method investments, while the 2015 impairment charges relate to our equity-method investments in appalachia midstream investments, dbjv, ueom, and laurel mountain. (see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
other investing income (loss) - net changed favorably due to a 2016 gain on the sale of an equity-method investment interest in a gathering system that was part of our appalachia midstream investments and higher interest income associated with a receivable related to the sale of certain former venezuela assets. (see note 6 - investing activities  of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
interest expense increased due to higher interest incurred of $99 million primarily attributable to new debt issuances in 2016 and 2015 and lower interest capitalized of $36 million primarily related to construction projects that have been placed into service, partially offset by lower interest due to 2015 and 2016 debt retirements. (see note 14 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
other income (expense) - net below operating income (loss) changed unfavorably primarily due to a decrease in allowance for equity funds used during construction (afudc) due to decreased spending on constitution and the absence of a $14 million gain on early debt retirement in 2015.
provision (benefit) for income taxes changed unfavorably primarily due to a decrease in pretax loss in 2016. see note 8 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective tax rates compared to the federal statutory rate for both years.
the unfavorable change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is primarily due to higher operating results at wpz, the impact of decreased income allocated to the wpz general partner driven by the impact of reduced incentive distributions from wpz associated with the termination of the wpz merger agreement, and the absence of the accelerated amortization of a beneficial conversion feature from the first quarter of 2015. these changes are partially offset by a favorable change primarily related to our partners' share of constitution project development costs in 2016.
2015 vs. 2014
service revenues increased primarily due to additional revenues associated with a full year of acmp operations in 2015, increased revenues associated with the start-up of operations at gulfstar one during the fourth quarter of 2014, and an increase in transco's natural gas transportation fees due to new projects placed in service in 2014 and 2015. revenues from operations associated with our acquisition of acmp and the northeast region also increased due to higher volumes related to new well connects. a decrease in canadian construction management revenues, reflecting a shift to internal customer construction projects, partially offset these increases.
product sales decreased due to a decrease in marketing revenues primarily associated with lower prices across all products, partially offset by higher non-ethane volumes, and a decrease in revenues from our equity ngls reflecting lower ngl prices, partially offset by higher ngl volumes. product sales also decreased due to lower olefin sales from other olefin operations associated with lower per-unit sales prices, partially offset by higher volumes. these decreases are partially offset by an increase in olefin sales primarily due to resuming our geismar operations during 2015.
product costs decreased due to a decrease in marketing purchases primarily associated with lower per-unit costs, partially offset by higher non-ethane volumes, and a decrease in natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls primarily due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher volumes. product costs also decreased
60
due to lower feedstock purchases in our other olefin operations primarily due to lower per-unit feedstock costs across all products as well as lower per-unit costs, partially offset by significantly higher volumes in 2015. these decreases are partially offset by an increase in olefin feedstock purchases primarily associated with resuming our geismar operations.
operating and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to new expenses associated with operations acquired in our acquisition of acmp, increased growth of operating activity in certain areas, increased maintenance and repair expenses, and the return to operations of the geismar plant. these increases are partially offset by a decrease in canadian construction management expenses that reflect a shift to internal customer construction projects.
depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to new expenses associated with operations acquired in our acquisition of acmp and from depreciation on new projects placed in service, including gulfstar one and the geismar expansion.
sg&a increased primarily due to administrative expenses associated with operations acquired in our acquisition of acmp, including $31 million higher acmp merger and transition-related costs, partially offset by the absence of $16 million of acquisition costs incurred in 2014. in addition, 2015 includes $32 million of costs associated with our evaluation of strategic alternatives. these increases are partially offset by the absence of $18 million of project development costs incurred in 2014 related to the bluegrass pipeline reflecting 100 percent of such costs. the 50 percent noncontrolling interest share of these costs are presented in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.
impairment of goodwill reflects a 2015 impairment charge associated with certain goodwill. (see note 17 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
impairment of certain assets relate primarily to 2015 impairments of previously capitalized development costs and surplus equipment write-downs. (see note 17 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
net insurance recoveries - geismar incident changed unfavorably primarily due to the receipt of $126 million of insurance recoveries in 2015 as compared to the receipt of $246 million of insurance recoveries in 2014.
other (income) expense - net within operating income (loss) changed unfavorably primarily due to the absence of $154 million of cash proceeds received in 2014 related to a contingency settlement gain and the absence of a $12 million net gain recognized in 2014 related to a partial acreage dedication release. (see note 7 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
operating income (loss) changed unfavorably primarily due to a 2015 impairment of goodwill, higher impairments of certain assets, higher depreciation, operating, and maintenance expenses related to construction projects placed in service and the start-up of the geismar plant, $229 million lower ngl margins driven by lower prices, lower insurance recoveries related to the geismar incident, higher costs related to the merger and integration of acmp into wpz, and 2015 strategic alternative expenses. these decreases were partially offset by increased service revenues related to construction projects placed in service, $116 million higher olefin margins primarily due to our geismar plant that returned to operations in 2015, and contributions from the operations acquired in our acquisition of acmp.
equity earnings (losses) changed favorably primarily due to the absence of equity losses from bluegrass pipeline and moss lake in 2014 and due to contributions from investments acquired in our acquisition of acmp. in addition, equity earnings at discovery increased $76 million primarily related to the completion of the keathley canyon connector in early 2015. these changes were partially offset by $33 million of losses associated with our share of impairments recognized at equity investees in 2015. (see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
gain on remeasurement of equity-method investment reflects the 2014 gain recognized as a result of remeasuring to fair value the equity-method investment that we held before we acquired a controlling interest in acmp. (see note 2 - acquisitions of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
impairment of equity-method investments reflects 2015 impairment charges associated with certain equity-method investments. (see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
61
other investing income (loss) - net changed unfavorably primarily due to lower interest income associated with a receivable related to the sale of certain former venezuela assets.
interest expense increased due to a $230 million increase in interest incurred primarily due to new debt issuances in 2014 and 2015 and interest expense associated with debt assumed in conjunction with our acquisition of acmp. this increase was partially offset by lower interest due to 2015 debt retirements and the absence of a $9 million transaction-related financing fee incurred in the second quarter of 2014 related to our acquisition of acmp. in addition, interest capitalized decreased $67 million primarily related to construction projects that have been placed into service. (see note 2 - acquisitions and note 14 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
other income (expense) - net below operating income (loss) changed favorably primarily due to a $43 million benefit related to an increase in afudc associated with an increase in spending on various transco expansion projects and constitution, a $14 million gain on early debt retirement in april 2015, and a $9 million contingency gain settlement.
provision (benefit) for income taxes changed favorably primarily due to lower pretax income in 2015. see note 8 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effective tax rates compared to the federal statutory rate for both years.
the favorable change in net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests related to our investment in wpz is primarily due to lower operating results at wpz, our increased percentage of limited partner ownership of wpz, and the impact of increased income allocated to the wpz general partner, held by us, associated with idrs. these changes are partially offset by an unfavorable change related to our investment in gulfstar one associated with its start up in 2014.
year-over-year operating results - segments we evaluate segment operating performance based upon modified ebitda. note 19 - segment disclosures of notes to consolidated financial statements includes a reconciliation of this non-gaap measure to net income (loss). management uses modified ebitda because it is an accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare company performance. in addition, management believes that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets. modified ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with gaap.

2016 vs. 2015
modified ebitda decreased primarily due to higher impairments, lower insurance recoveries associated with the geismar incident, and loss on sale associated with our canadian operations. these decreases were partially offset by higher olefin margins related to the geismar plant operating at higher production levels in 2016, lower segment costs and expenses, and higher earnings related to our equity-method investments, including the completion of the keathley canyon connector at discovery in the first quarter of 2015. additionally, higher marketing margins, higher service revenues related to projects placed in service, and higher ngl margins improved modified ebitda.
the increase in service revenues is primarily due to a $79 million increase in transco's natural gas transportation fee revenues primarily associated with expansion projects placed in service in 2015 and 2016 and a $31 million transportation and fractionation revenue increase associated with williams ngl & petchem's horizon liquids extraction plant in canada. the canadian operations were sold in late september 2016. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in gathering, processing, and fractionation revenue primarily due to lower volumes primarily in the barnett shale and anadarko basin and a $15 million decrease in transco's storage revenue related to potential refunds associated with a ruling received in certain rate case litigation in 2016.
product sales increased primarily due to:
•   a $94 million increase in olefin sales comprised of a $170 million increase from our geismar plant that returned to service in late march 2015, partially offset by a $76 million decrease from our other olefin operations. the increase at geismar includes $153 million associated with increased volumes as a result of the plant operating at higher production levels in 2016 than when production resumed in march 2015 following the geismar incident and $17 million primarily associated with higher ethylene per-unit sales prices. the decrease in other olefin sales includes a $14 million reduction due to the absence of our former canadian operations in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as lower volumes and lower per-unit sales prices within our other olefin operations;
•   a $70 million increase in marketing revenues primarily due to higher ngl and propylene prices and natural gas and crude oil volumes, partially offset by lower ngl volumes and crude oil prices (partially offset in marketing purchases);
•   a $6 million increase in revenues from our equity ngls due to a $10 million increase associated with higher volumes, partially offset by a $4 million decrease associated with lower ngl prices;
•   a $39 million decrease in system management gas sales from transco. system management gas sales are offset in product costs and, therefore, have no impact on modified ebitda.
the decrease in product costs includes:
•   a $39 million decrease in system management gas costs (offset in product sales);
•   a $17 million decrease in olefin feedstock purchases is primarily comprised of $78 million in lower purchases at our other olefins operations, partially offset by $61 million of higher purchases due primarily to increased volumes at our geismar plant resulting from higher productions levels. the lower costs at our other olefin operations are comprised of $54 million in lower per-unit feedstock costs and $24 million in primarily lower propylene volumes;
•   a $4 million decrease in natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls reflecting a decrease of $13 million due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by a $9 million increase associated with higher volumes;
•   lower costs associated with various other products, primarily condensate;
63
•   a $22 million increase in marketing purchases primarily due to the same factors that increased marketing sales (more than offset in marketing revenues). the increase in marketing costs does not reflect the intercompany costs associated with certain gathering and processing services performed by an affiliate.
the decrease in other segment costs and expenses is primarily due to lower operating costs and general and administrative expenses reflecting decreases in primarily labor-related and outside services costs resulting from our first-quarter 2016 workforce reductions and ongoing cost containment efforts and lower costs associated with general maintenance activities in the marcellus shale, as well as $43 million of lower acmp merger and transition-related expenses. other items partially offsetting these decreases are as follows:
•   $34 million increase related to the 2016 loss on sale of our canadian operations;
•   $37 million increase for severance and related costs associated with workforce reductions incurred in the first quarter of 2016 and the organizational realignment in the fourth quarter of 2016;
•   $28 million higher project development costs at constitution as we discontinued capitalization of development costs related to this project beginning in april 2016;
•   $22 million higher contract services for pipeline testing and general maintenance at transco;
•   $20 million unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange that primarily relates to losses incurred on foreign currency transactions and the remeasurement of the u.s. dollar-denominated current assets and liabilities within our former canadian operations;
•   $19 million unfavorable change in afudc associated with a decrease in spending on constitution;
•   the absence of a $14 million gain recognized in second-quarter 2015 resulting from the early retirement of certain debt.
net insurance recoveries - geismar incident decreased reflecting $7 million of insurance proceeds received in 2016 compared to $126 million received in 2015.
impairment of certain assets increased primarily due to 2016 impairments of $341 million associated with our canadian operations and $63 million associated with certain mid-continent gathering assets as well as impairments or write-downs of other certain assets that may no longer be in use or are surplus in nature, partially offset by the absence of 2015 impairments of $94 million associated with previously capitalized project development costs for a gas processing plant and $20 million associated with certain surplus equipment within our ohio valley midstream business. (see note 17 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
the increase in proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments is primarily due to a $30 million increase from discovery primarily associated with higher fee revenues attributable to the completion of the keathley canyon connector in the first quarter of 2015. additionally, caiman ii contributed a $20 million increase resulting from higher volumes due to assets placed into service in 2015, oppl contributed a $16 million increase primarily due to higher transportation volumes and lower expenses, and ueom contributed an $11 million increase primarily associated with an increase in our ownership percentage. these increases were partially offset by an $29 million decrease from appalachia midstream investments primarily due to lower fee revenues driven by lower rates, partially offset by lower impairments and higher volumes.
2015 vs. 2014
modified ebitda increased primarily due to the acquisition of acmp during the third quarter of 2014 and increased fee revenue associated with contributions from new and expanded facilities, including gulfstar one during the fourth quarter of 2014, in addition to resuming our geismar operations and contributions related to the completion of the keathley canyon connector at discovery. partially offsetting these increases to modified ebitda is a decrease in
64
ngl margins as a result of a significant decline in commodity prices beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower insurance recoveries related to the geismar incident.
the increase in service revenues is primarily due to $810 million additional revenues associated with a full year of acmp operations in 2015 which includes a $72 million increase in the minimum volume commitment fees, $223 million in increased revenues associated with the start-up of operations at gulfstar one during the fourth quarter of 2014, and a $155 million increase in transco's natural gas transportation fees due to new projects placed in service in 2015 and 2014. additionally, service revenues reflect higher fees associated with increased volumes and additional contributions in the northeast. higher revenues in the northeast include expanded gathering operations and processing, fractionation and transportation operations, contributing $59 million and $27 million of additional fees, respectively.
the decrease in product sales includes:
•   a $1,173 million decrease in marketing revenues primarily associated with lower prices across all products, partially offset by higher non-ethane volumes (more than offset in marketing purchases);
•   a $324 million decrease in revenues from our equity ngls reflecting a decrease of $365 million due to lower ngl prices, partially offset by a $41 million increase associated with higher ngl volumes;
•   a $41 million decrease in revenues primarily due to lower condensate prices;
•   a $214 million increase in olefin sales primarily due to $298 million in higher sales from our geismar plant that returned to operation, partially offset by an $84 million decrease from our other olefin operations due to lower sales prices, partially offset by higher volumes across all products, particularly propylene.
the decrease in product costs includes:
•   a $1,219 million decrease in marketing purchases primarily due to a decrease in non-ethane per-unit cost (substantially offset in marketing revenues);
•   a $95 million decrease in the natural gas purchases associated with the production of equity ngls reflecting a decrease of $126 million due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by a $31 million increase associated with higher volumes;
•   a $20 million decrease in costs primarily due to lower gas prices;
•   a $98 million increase in olefin feedstock purchases is comprised of $127 million in higher purchases due to increased volumes at our geismar plant as it returned to operation, partially offset by $29 million in lower other olefin operations feedstock purchases primarily due to lower per-unit feedstock costs, partially offset by higher volumes across most products, particularly propylene.
the increase in other segment costs and expenses includes:
•   an increase for new expenses associated with operations associated with the acquisition of acmp;
•   the absence of $154 million of cash received in the fourth quarter of 2014 associated with the resolution of a contingent gain related to claims arising from the purchase of a business in a prior period (see note 7 - other income and expenses of notes to consolidated financial statements);
•   a $16 million increase in operating expense due to the geismar plant returning to operation in 2015;
•   the absence of a $12 million net gain recognized in 2014 related to a partial acreage dedication release.
the decrease in net insurance recoveries - geismar incident is primarily due to the 2015 receipt of $126 million of insurance proceeds compared to $246 million received in 2014, partially offset by the absence of covered insurable
65
expenses in excess of our retentions (deductibles) related to the geismar incident in 2015 compared to $14 million in 2014.
impairment of certain assets increased primarily due to a 2015 $94 million impairment charge associated with previously capitalized project development costs for a gas processing plant. (see note 17 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
the increase in proportional modified ebitda of equity-method investments is primarily due to a full year contribution of $160 million from investments associated with the acquisition of acmp and a $103 million increase from discovery associated with higher fee revenues attributable to the completion of the keathley canyon connector in the first quarter of 2015. additionally, caiman ii increased $21 million resulting from assets placed into service in 2014 and 2015, partially offset by the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds received in the prior year, and an $11 million decrease at laurel mountain. the decrease at laurel mountain was primarily due to $13 million of impairments and lower gathering fees due to lower gathering rates indexed to natural gas prices, partially offset by 24 percent higher volumes and an increase in our ownership percentage compared to the prior year.

2016 vs. 2015
the unfavorable change in modified ebitda is primarily due to the 2016 impairment and subsequent loss on disposal of our canadian operations as well as the expensing of certain development costs associated with the canadian pdh facility, partially offset by the absence of the 2015 write-off of previously capitalized project development costs for an olefins pipeline project.
the increase in product sales and product costs is primarily due to the horizon liquids extraction plant coming online in march 2016 until it was sold in september 2016.
the unfavorable change in other segment costs and expenses is primarily due to $61 million of certain project development costs associated with the canadian pdh facility that we began expensing in 2016. additionally, the unfavorable change includes $33 million of transportation and fractionation fees associated with our new horizon volumes and a $32 million loss on the sale of our canadian operations in september 2016. (see note 3 - divestiture of notes to consolidated financial statements.) the unfavorable change in other segment costs and expenses is partially offset by a $10 million gain on the sale of unused pipe in 2016 and the absence of the $64 million write-off of previously capitalized project development costs for an olefins pipeline project in 2015. (see note 17 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
the unfavorable change in impairment of certain assets primarily reflects the 2016 impairment of our canadian operations and an $8 million impairment of idle pipe. (see note 17 - fair value measurements, guarantees, and concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
.

2015 vs. 2014
the favorable change in modified ebitda is primarily due to the absence of our share of the 2014 write-off of previously capitalized project development costs at bluegrass pipeline and moss lake, as well as costs incurred in 2014 relating to the development of the bluegrass pipeline, partially offset by the 2015 write-off of previously capitalized project development costs for an olefins pipeline project.

2015 vs. 2014
modified ebitda decreased significantly as the results from the businesses acquired with our acquisition of acmp are presented within williams partners for periods subsequent to the july 1, 2014, acquisition. other included the proportional modified ebitda of $104 million of our former equity-method investment in acmp for the first half of 2014, which was partially offset by $19 million associated with our share of compensation costs triggered by the acmp acquisition recognized in july 2014. modified ebitda also decreased by $30 million related to costs incurred in 2015 related to evaluating our strategic alternatives and the merger agreement with energy transfer, as well as $24 million of higher costs associated with integration and re-alignment of resources following the acmp acquisition and merger. these decreases are partially offset by a $9 million contingency gain settlement recognized in fourth quarter 2015.
67
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and liquidity overview in 2016, we continued to focus upon growth in our businesses through disciplined investment and reducing our costs and funding needs. examples of this activity included:
•   expansion of wpz's interstate natural gas pipeline system through projects such as rock springs to meet the demand of growth markets;
•   completion of wpz's gulfstar one expansion project to provide production handling and gathering services for the gunflint oil and gas discovery in the eastern deepwater gulf of mexico;
•   wpz's restructuring of contracts in the barnett shale and mid-continent region,which included cash payments to wpz of $820 million;
•   sale of our canadian operations (see note 3 - divestiture of notes to consolidated financial statements).
outlook fee-based businesses are becoming an even more significant component of our portfolio and serve to reduce the influence of commodity price fluctuations on our cash flows. we expect to benefit as continued growth in demand for low-cost natural gas is driven by increases in lng exports, industrial demand, and power generation.
we believe we have, or have access to, the financial resources and liquidity necessary to meet our requirements for working capital, capital and investment expenditures, dividends and distributions, debt service payments, and tax payments, while maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity. in particular, as previously discussed in company outlook, our expected growth capital and investment expenditures total approximately $2.1 billion to $2.8 billion in 2017. approximately $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion of our growth capital funding needs include transco expansions and other interstate pipeline growth projects, most of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements. the remaining growth capital spending in 2017 primarily reflects investment in gathering and processing systems in the northeast region limited primarily to known new producer volumes, including volumes that support transco expansion projects including our atlantic sunrise project. in addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments. we retain the flexibility to adjust planned levels of capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in economic conditions or business opportunities.
in january 2017, wpz announced that it will redeem all of its $750 million 6.125 percent senior notes due 2022 on february 23, 2017. in addition, we expect after-tax proceeds in excess of $2 billion from planned asset monetizations of geismar and other select assets during 2017, which we expect williams partners to use for additional debt reduction and to fund capital and investment expenditures.
liquidity based on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage our businesses in 2017. our internal and external sources of consolidated liquidity to fund working capital requirements, capital and investment expenditures, debt service payments, dividends and distributions, and tax payments include:
•   cash and cash equivalents on hand;
•   cash generated from operations;
•   distributions from wpz;
•   distributions from our equity-method investees based on our level of ownership;
68
•   use of our credit facility;
•   cash proceeds from issuances of debt and/or equity securities.
wpz is expected to fund its cash needs through its cash flows from operations and its credit facility and/or commercial paper program, as well as proceeds from planned asset monetizations as previously mentioned. wpz also established a distribution reinvestment program (drip) in the third quarter of 2016.
we previously announced that we intended to reinvest approximately $1.2 billion into wpz in 2017 via the drip, funded primarily by our reduced quarterly cash dividend which would have allowed us to annually retain approximately $1.3 billion for reinvestment. as part of the financial repositioning announced in january 2017, we discontinued our participation in the drip and expect to increase our regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.30 for the dividend to be paid in march 2017. (see note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
we anticipate our more significant uses of cash to be:
•   working capital requirements;
•   maintenance and expansion capital and investment expenditures;
•   interest on our long-term debt;
•   repayment of current debt maturities, and additional reductions in wpz's debt with funds received as part of the financial repositioning;
•   investment in wpz as part of the financial repositioning (see note 15 - stockholders' equity of notes to consolidated financial statements);
•   quarterly dividends to our shareholders.
potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity discussed above include those previously discussed in company outlook.
as of december 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit (current liabilities, inclusive of $785 million in long-term debt due within one year, in excess of current assets) of $1.487 billion. our available liquidity is as follows:

as described in note 14 - debt, banking arrangements, and leases of notes to consolidated financial statements, we have determined that we have net assets that are technically considered restricted in accordance with rule 4-08(e) of regulation s-x of the securities and exchange commission in excess of 25 percent of our consolidated net assets. we do not expect this determination will impact our ability to pay dividends or meet future obligations as the terms of wpz's partnership agreement require it to make quarterly distributions of all available cash, as defined, to its unitholders.
wpz incentive distribution rights as part of the financial repositioning, we permanently waived our right to incentive distributions from wpz. (see overview in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.)
through december 31, 2016, our ownership interest in wpz included the right to incentive distributions determined in accordance with wpz's partnership agreement. in connection with the sale of wpz's canadian operations in the third quarter of 2016, we agreed to waive $150 million of incentive distributions otherwise payable by wpz to us in the fourth quarter of 2016. (see note 3 - divestiture of notes to consolidated financial statements.)
we had agreed to temporarily waive incentive distributions of approximately $2 million per quarter in connection with wpz's acquisition of an approximate 13 percent additional interest in ueom on june 10, 2015. the waiver would have continued through the quarter ending september 30, 2017.
we were required to pay a $428 million termination fee to wpz, associated with the termination agreement (as described in note 1 - general, description of business, basis of presentation, and summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements), which settled through a reduction of quarterly incentive distributions we are entitled to receive from wpz (such reduction not to exceed $209 million per quarter). the november 2015, february 2016, and may 2016 distributions from wpz were reduced by $209 million, $209 million, and $10 million, respectively, related to this termination fee.
registrations in september 2016, wpz filed a registration statement for its new drip discussed above. in november 2016, wpz received reinvested distributions of $260 million, of which $250 million related to us.
in may 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement, as a well-known seasoned issuer.
in february 2015, wpz filed a shelf registration statement, as a well-known seasoned issuer, and wpz also filed a shelf registration statement for the offer and sale from time to time of common units representing limited partner interests in wpz having an aggregate offering price of up to $1 billion. these sales are to be made over a period of time and from time to time in transactions at prices which are market prices prevailing at the time of sale, prices related to market price, or at negotiated prices. such sales are to be made pursuant to an equity distribution agreement between wpz and certain banks who may act as sales agents or purchase for their own accounts as principals. during 2016 and 2015, wpz received net proceeds of approximately $115 million and approximately $59 million, respectively, from equity issued under this registration.
distributions from equity-method investees the organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of their available cash to their members on a quarterly basis. in each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. (see note 6 - investing activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for our more significant equity-method investees.)

______________
(1)   includes the borrowings outstanding under credit facilities, but does not include any related variable-rate interest payments.
(2)   includes $750 million of 6.125 percent senior notes due 2022 that wpz intends to redeem on february 23, 2017 and related interest, presented in the table above according to the original contractual terms.
(3)   includes approximately $244 million in open property, plant, and equipment purchase orders. includes an estimated $418 million long-term ethane purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that is reflected in this table at december 31, 2016 prices. this obligation is part of an overall exchange agreement whereby volumes we transport on oppl are sold at a third-party fractionator near conway, kansas, and we are subsequently obligated to purchase ethane volumes at mont belvieu. the purchased ethane volumes may be utilized or resold at comparable prices in the mont belvieu market. includes an estimated $619 million long-term ethane purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that primarily supplies third parties at their plants and is valued in this table at a price calculated using december 31, 2016 prices. any excess purchased volumes may be sold at comparable market prices. includes an estimated $586 million long-term mixed ngls purchase obligation with index-based pricing terms that is reflected in this table at december 31, 2016 prices. in addition, we have not included certain natural gas life-of-lease contracts for which the future volumes are indeterminable. we have not included commitments, beyond purchase orders, for the acquisition or construction of property, plant, and equipment or expected contributions to our jointly owned investments. (see company outlook - expansion projects.)
(4)   does not include estimated contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans of $72 million in 2016 and $70 million in 2015. in 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $69 million to these plans (see note 10 - employee benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements). tax-qualified pension plans are required to meet minimum contribution requirements. in the past, we have contributed amounts to our tax-qualified pension plans in excess of the minimum required contribution. these excess amounts can be used to offset future minimum contribution requirements. during 2016, we contributed $60 million to our tax-qualified pension plans. in addition to these contributions, a portion of the excess contributions was used to meet the minimum contribution requirements. during 2017, we expect to contribute approximately $60 million to our tax-qualified pension plans and use excess amounts to satisfy minimum contribution requirements, if needed. additionally, estimated future minimum funding requirements may vary significantly from historical requirements if actual results differ significantly from estimated
73
results for assumptions such as returns on plan assets, interest rates, retirement rates, mortality, and other significant assumptions or by changes to current legislation and regulations.
(5)   we have not included income tax liabilities in the table above. see note 8 - provision (benefit) for income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes, including our contingent tax liability reserves.
effects of inflation our operations have historically not been materially affected by inflation. approximately 39 percent of our gross property, plant, and equipment is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipeline assets. they are subject to regulation, which limits recovery to historical cost. while amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under current ferc practices, we anticipate being allowed to recover and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to replace existing assets. cost-based regulations, along with competition and other market factors, may limit our ability to recover such increased costs. for our gathering and processing assets, operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by both competition for specialized services and specific price changes in crude oil and natural gas and related commodities than by changes in general inflation. crude oil, natural gas, and ngl prices are particularly sensitive to the market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in the near future, as well as general economic conditions. however, our exposure to certain of these price changes is reduced through the fee-based nature of certain of our services and the use of hedging instruments.
environmental we are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations, and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently do not own (see note 18 - contingent liabilities and commitments of notes to consolidated financial statements). we are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties, the epa, or other governmental authorities. we are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others. current estimates of the most likely costs of such activities are approximately $38 million, all of which are included in accrued liabilities and regulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other on the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2016. we will seek recovery of approximately $9 million of these accrued costs through future natural gas transmission rates. the remainder of these costs will be funded from operations. during 2016, we paid approximately $6 million for cleanup and/or remediation and monitoring activities. we expect to pay approximately $9 million in 2017 for these activities. estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. at december 31, 2016, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the epa or other governmental authorities, and other factors.
in march 2008, the epa promulgated a new, lower national ambient air quality standard (naaqs) for ground-level ozone. in may 2012, the epa completed designation of new eight-hour ozone nonattainment areas. several transco facilities are located in 2008 ozone nonattainment areas. in december 2014, the epa proposed to further reduce the ground-level ozone naaqs from the march 2008 levels and subsequently finalized a rule on october 1, 2015. we are monitoring the rule's implementation as the reduction will trigger additional federal and state regulatory actions that may impact our operations. to date, no federal actions have been proposed to mandate additional emission controls at these facilities. pursuant to recently finalized state regulatory actions associated with implementation of the 2008 ozone standard, we anticipate that some facilities may be subject to increased controls within five years. implementation of the regulations is expected to result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to property, plant, and equipment - net on the consolidated balance sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas. we are unable at this time to estimate with any certainty the cost of additions that may be required to meet the regulations.
on january 22, 2010, the epa set a new one-hour nitrogen dioxide (no2) naaqs. the effective date of the new no2 standard was april 12, 2010. on january 20, 2012, the epa determined pursuant to available information that no area in the country is violating the 2010 no2 naaqs and thus designated all areas of the country as "unclassifiable/attainment." also, at that time the epa noted its plan to deploy an expanded no2 monitoring network beginning in 2013. however on october 5, 2012, the epa proposed a graduated implementation of the monitoring network between
74
january 1, 2014 and january 1, 2017. once three years of data is collected from the new monitoring network, the epa will reassess attainment status with the one-hour no2 naaqs. until that time, the epa or states may require ambient air quality modeling on a case by case basis to demonstrate compliance with the no2 standard. because we are unable to predict the outcome of the epa's or states' future assessment using the new monitoring network, we are unable to estimate the cost of additions that may be required to meet this regulation.
our interstate natural gas pipelines consider prudently incurred environmental assessment and remediation costs and the costs associated with compliance with environmental standards to be recoverable through rates.

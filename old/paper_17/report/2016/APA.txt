item 1a.   risk factors our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant hazards and risks, including those described below. if any of such events should occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. additional risks relating to our securities may be included in the prospectuses for securities we issue in the future.
crude oil and natural gas price volatility, including the recent decline in prices for oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock.
our revenues, operating results, and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production. historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. for example, the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month oil contract in 2016 ranged from a high of $54.06 per barrel to a low of $26.21 per barrel. the nymex daily settlement price for the prompt month natural gas contract in 2016 ranged from a high of $3.93 per mmbtu to a low of $1.64 per mmbtu. the market prices for crude oil and natural gas depend on factors beyond our control. these factors include demand for crude oil and natural gas, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions, and other factors, including:
•   worldwide and domestic supplies of crude oil and natural gas;
•   actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations, including the organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec);
•   political conditions and events (including instability, changes in governments, or armed conflict) in crude oil or natural gas producing regions;
•   the level of global crude oil and natural gas inventories;
•   the price and level of imported foreign crude oil and natural gas;
•   the price and availability of alternative fuels, including coal and biofuels;
•   the availability of pipeline capacity and infrastructure;
•   the availability of crude oil transportation and refining capacity;
•   weather conditions;
•   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and
•   the overall economic environment.
our results of operations, as well as the carrying value of our oil and gas properties, are substantially dependent upon the prices of oil and natural gas, which have declined significantly since june 2014. despite slight increases in oil and natural gas prices in 2016, prices have remained significantly lower than levels seen in recent years, which has adversely affected our revenues, operating income, cash flow, and proved reserves. continued low prices could have a material adverse impact on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures. without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. sustained low prices of crude oil and natural gas may further adversely impact our business as follows:
•   limiting our financial condition, liquidity, and/or ability to fund planned capital expenditures and operations;
•   reducing the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically;
•   causing us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;
•   reducing our revenues, operating income, and cash flows;
•   limiting our access to sources of capital, such as equity and long-term debt;
•   reducing the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties, resulting in additional non-cash impairments;
•   reducing the carrying value of our gathering, transmission, and processing facilities, resulting in additional impairments; or
•   reducing the carrying value of goodwill.
14
our ability to sell natural gas or oil and/or receive market prices for our natural gas or oil may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions.
a portion of our natural gas and oil production in any region may be interrupted, limited, or shut in, from time to time for numerous reasons, including as a result of weather conditions, accidents, loss of pipeline or gathering system access, field labor issues or strikes, or capital constraints that limit the ability of third parties to construct gathering systems, processing facilities, or interstate pipelines to transport our production, or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions. if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time, it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flows.
future economic conditions in the u.s. and certain international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results.
current global market conditions, and uncertainty, including economic instability in europe and certain emerging markets, is likely to have significant long-term effects. global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels. a lower future economic growth rate could result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which would reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability.
weather and climate may have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and production.
demand for oil and natural gas are, to a degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impact the price we receive for the commodities we produce. in addition, our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or storms in the north sea, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment. our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs, and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such weather conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, or insured against.
our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:
•   well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;
•   pipeline or other facility ruptures and spills;
•   fires;
•   formations with abnormal pressures;
•   equipment malfunctions;
•   hurricanes, storms, and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on and offshore the gulf coast and north sea and other natural disasters and weather conditions; and
•   surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents, saltwater, or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.
failure or loss of equipment as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber attacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture, or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. if a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
15
cyber attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.
our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, and production activities. we depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, communicate with our employees and third party partners, and conduct many of our activities. unauthorized access to our digital technology could lead to operational disruption, data corruption or exposure, communication interruption, loss of intellectual property, loss of confidential and fiduciary data, and loss or corruption of reserves or other proprietary information. also, external digital technologies control nearly all of the oil and gas distribution and refining systems in the united states and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production. a cyber attack directed at oil and gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets, and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.
while we have experienced cyber attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. further, as cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber attacks.
our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases and may expose us to other risks.
to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk. in addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:
•   our production falls short of the hedged volumes;
•   there is a widening of price-basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement;
•   the counterparties to our hedging or other price risk management contracts fail to perform under those arrangements; or
•   an unexpected event materially impacts oil and natural gas prices.
the credit risk of financial institutions could adversely affect us.
we have exposure to different counterparties, and we have entered into transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, other investment funds, and other institutions. these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. deterioration in the credit or financial markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. we may also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of derivative transactions in connection with any hedges. we also have exposure to insurance companies in the form of claims under our policies. in addition, if any lender under our credit facilities is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity will be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender's commitment under our credit facilities.
we are exposed to a risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. this risk of counterparty non-performance is of particular concern given the recent volatility of the financial markets and significant decline in oil and natural gas prices, which could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty's liquidity and impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. we are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty's creditworthiness or ability to perform. even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our hedge providers, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed to us by the distressed entity or entities. during periods of falling commodity prices our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. if the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.
16
the distressed financial conditions of our purchasers and partners could have an adverse impact on us in the event they are unable to pay us for the products or services we provide or to reimburse us for their share of costs.
concerns about global economic conditions and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices have had a significant adverse impact on the oil and gas industry. we are exposed to risk of financial loss from trade, joint venture, joint interest billing, and other receivables. we sell our crude oil, natural gas, and ngls to a variety of purchasers. as operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. as a result of current economic conditions and the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices, some of our customers and non-operating partners may experience severe financial problems that may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our financially distressed customers or non-operating partners will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, future results of operations, or future cash flows. furthermore, the bankruptcy of one or more of our customers or non-operating partners, or some other similar proceeding or liquidity constraint, might make it unlikely that we would be able to collect all or a significant portion of amounts owed by the distressed entity or entities. nonperformance by a trade creditor or non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.
a downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital.
we receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the united states. factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. a ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations. on february 2, 2016, our credit rating was downgraded by standard and poor's to bbb/stable, and on february 25, 2016, our credit rating was downgraded by moody's to baa3/negative outlook, in each case as part of an industry-wide review and downgrade of u.s. exploration and production and oilfield services companies due to deteriorating commodity prices. subsequently, on november 11, 2016, moody's changed our rating outlook to stable and affirmed our baa3 rating. any future downgrades could result in additional postings ranging from approximately $400 million to $1.0 billion, depending upon timing and availability of tax relief.
market conditions may restrict our ability to obtain funds for future development and working capital needs, which may limit our financial flexibility.
the financial markets are subject to fluctuation and are vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. we have a significant development project inventory and an extensive exploration portfolio, which will require substantial future investment. we and/or our partners may need to seek financing in order to fund these or other future activities. our future access to capital, as well as that of our partners and contractors, could be limited if the debt or equity markets are constrained. this could significantly delay development of our property interests.
our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.
the payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations, and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.
any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including common stock. in addition, under delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from "surplus," which is the amount by which the fair value of our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then current and/or the preceding fiscal year. further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.
17
discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and production.
the production rate from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. therefore, unless we add reserves through exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones, secondary recovery reserves, or tertiary recovery reserves, or acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, our estimated proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced. future oil and gas production is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. furthermore, if oil or gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.
we may not realize an adequate return on wells that we drill.
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. the wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. the costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to:
•   unexpected drilling conditions;
•   pressure or irregularities in formations;
•   equipment failures or accidents;
•   fires, explosions, blowouts, and surface cratering;
•   marine risks such as capsizing, collisions, and hurricanes;
•   other adverse weather conditions; and
•   increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs and equipment.
future drilling activities may not be successful, and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. while all drilling, whether developmental or exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.
material differences between the estimated and actual timing of critical events or costs may affect the completion and commencement of production from development projects.
we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of these projects may be delayed beyond our anticipated completion dates. our projects may be delayed by project approvals from joint venture partners, timely issuances of permits and licenses by governmental agencies, weather conditions, manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment, and other unforeseen events. delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events may adversely affect our large development projects and our ability to participate in large-scale development projects in the future. in addition, our estimates of future development costs are based on current expectation of prices and other costs of equipment and personnel we will need to implement such projects. our actual future development costs may be significantly higher than we currently estimate. if costs become too high, our development projects may become uneconomic to us, and we may be forced to abandon such development projects.
18
we may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.
although we perform a review of properties that we acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, such reviews are inherently incomplete. it generally is not feasible to review in-depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher-value properties and will sample the remainder. however, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us as a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully and accurately their deficiencies and potential. inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties. there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. in addition, there can be no assurance that acquisitions will not have an adverse effect upon our operating results, particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired businesses are being integrated into our ongoing operations.
our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of our transaction counterparties become the subject of a bankruptcy case.
over the last several years, we have taken action to enhance and streamline our north american portfolio through not only the acquisition of assets in key operating regions but also the divestitures of noncore domestic assets and the monetization of certain nonstrategic international assets. the agreements relating to these transactions contain provisions pursuant to which liabilities related to past and future operations have been allocated between the parties by means of liability assumptions, indemnities, escrows, trusts, and similar arrangements. one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on its ability to perform its obligations under these agreements and its solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. in the event that any such counterparty were to become unable financially to perform its liabilities or obligations assumed and as a result become the subject of a case or proceeding under title 11 of the united states code (the bankruptcy code) or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as insolvency laws) the counterparty may not perform its obligations under the agreements related to these transactions. in that case, our remedy would be a claim in the proceeding for damages for the breach of the contractual arrangement, which may be either a secured claim or an unsecured claim depending on whether or not we have collateral from the counterparty for the performance of the obligations. resolution of our damage claim in such a proceeding may be delayed, and we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of the obligations assumed by the counterparties under such agreements should they arise.
despite the provisions in our agreements requiring purchasers of our state or federal leasehold interests to assume certain liabilities and obligations related to such interests, if a purchaser of such interests becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws and/or becomes unable financially to perform such liabilities or obligations, the relevant governmental authorities could require us to perform, and hold us responsible for, such liabilities and obligations, such as the decommissioning of such transferred assets. in such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
if a court or a governmental authority were to make any of the foregoing determinations or take any of the foregoing actions, or any similar determination or action, it could adversely impact our cash flows, operations, or financial condition.
crude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves and their value. reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. because of the high degree of judgment involved, the accuracy of any reserve estimate is inherently imprecise, and a function of the quality of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation. our reserves estimates are based on 12-month average prices, except where contractual arrangements exist; therefore, reserves quantities will change when actual prices increase or decrease. in addition, results of drilling, testing, and production may substantially change the reserve estimates for a given reservoir over time. the estimates of our proved reserves and estimated future net revenues also depend on a number of factors and assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results, including:
•   historical production from the area compared with production from other areas;
•   the effects of regulations by governmental agencies, including changes to severance and excise taxes;
•   future operating costs and capital expenditures; and
•   workover and remediation costs.
19
for these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. accordingly, reserves estimates may be subject to upward or downward adjustment, and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates.
additionally, because some of our reserves estimates are calculated using volumetric analysis, those estimates are less reliable than the estimates based on a lengthy production history. volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure. in addition, realization or recognition of proved undeveloped reserves will depend on our development schedule and plans. a change in future development plans for proved undeveloped reserves could cause the discontinuation of the classification of these reserves as proved.
certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.
a sizeable portion of our acreage is currently undeveloped. unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. if our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling, and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals.
we may incur significant costs related to environmental matters.
as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to various federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. these laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up and other remediation activities resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution and other damages, limit or constrain operations in affected areas, and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. our efforts to limit our exposure to such liability and cost may prove inadequate and result in significant adverse effects to our results of operations. in addition, it is possible that the increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures. such capital expenditures could adversely impact our cash flows and our financial condition.
our north american operations are subject to governmental risks.
our north american operations have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls, and environmental protection laws and regulations.
in response to the deepwater horizon incident in the u.s. gulf of mexico in april 2010, and as directed by the secretary of the u.s. department of the interior, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (bsee) issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment, and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the gulf of mexico. these regulations imposed additional requirements and caused delays with respect to development and production activities in the gulf of mexico.
with respect to oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico, the boem has issued a new notice to lessees (ntl no. 2016-n01) significantly revising the obligations of companies operating in the gulf of mexico to provide supplemental assurances of performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies' oil and gas leases. while requirements under the new ntl have not yet been fully implemented by boem, the new ntl may require that apache provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to apache's current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases. we are working closely with boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the new ntl. additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets or with whom apache has joint ownership. such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties' solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.
20
new political developments, laws, and the enactment of new or stricter regulations in the gulf of mexico or otherwise impacting our north american operations, and increased liability for companies operating in this sector may adversely impact our results of operations.
changes to existing regulations related to emissions and the impact of any changes in climate could adversely impact our business.
certain countries where we operate, including canada and the united kingdom, either tax or assess some form of greenhouse gas (ghg) related fees on our operations. exposure has not been material to date, although a change in existing regulations could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
in the event the predictions for rising temperatures and sea levels suggested by reports of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change do transpire, we do not believe those events by themselves are likely to impact our assets or operations. however, any increase in severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.
the present u.s. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and natural gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. future legislation may result in the elimination of certain u.s. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development.
the present u.s. federal and state income tax laws affecting oil and natural gas exploration, development, and extraction may be modified by administrative, legislative, or judicial interpretation at any time. previous legislative proposals, if enacted into law, could make significant changes to such laws, including the elimination of certain key u.s. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. these changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain u.s. production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. the president and congress could include some or all of these previously proposed changes in conjunction with lower tax rates as part of fundamental tax reform legislation. the passage or adoption of these changes, or similar changes, could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development. further, the president and congress may propose and implement more general tax reform changes including changes to cost recovery rules, the deductibility of interest expense, the taxation of foreign dividends, and a border adjustability provision that would impact the taxation of oil and gas companies. we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will be enacted. any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
proposed federal, state, or local regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.
several proposals are before the u.s. congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the safe drinking water act. several states are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to earthquakes. in addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. we routinely use fracturing techniques in the u.s. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. it is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations.
although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the u.s.
international operations have uncertain political, economic, and other risks.
our operations outside north america are based primarily in egypt and the united kingdom. on a barrel equivalent basis, approximately 46 percent of our 2016 production was outside north america, and approximately 31 percent of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves on december 31, 2016, were located outside north america. as a result, a significant portion of our production and resources are subject to the increased political and economic risks and other factors associated with international operations including, but not limited to:
•   general strikes and civil unrest;
21
•   the risk of war, acts of terrorism, expropriation and resource nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts;
•   import and export regulations;
•   taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and investment restrictions;
•   price control;
•   transportation regulations and tariffs;
•   constrained natural gas markets dependent on demand in a single or limited geographical area;
•   exchange controls, currency fluctuations, devaluation, or other activities that limit or disrupt markets and restrict payments or the movement of funds;
•   laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade, including trade sanctions;
•   the possibility of being subject to exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes relating to licenses to operate and concession rights in countries where we currently operate;
•   the possible inability to subject foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of courts in the united states; and
•   difficulties in enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations.
foreign countries have occasionally asserted rights to oil and gas properties through border disputes. if a country claims superior rights to oil and gas leases or concessions granted to us by another country, our interests could decrease in value or be lost. even our smaller international assets may affect our overall business and results of operations by distracting management's attention from our more significant assets. certain regions of the world in which we operate have a history of political and economic instability. this instability could result in new governments or the adoption of new policies that might result in a substantially more hostile attitude toward foreign investments such as ours. in an extreme case, such a change could result in termination of contract rights and expropriation of our assets. this could adversely affect our interests and our future profitability.
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities as have occurred in egypt and libya may have on the oil and gas industry in general, and on our operations in particular, is not known at this time. uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, and refineries, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war. we may be required to incur significant costs in the future to safeguard our assets against terrorist activities.
a deterioration of conditions in egypt or changes in the economic and political environment in egypt could have an adverse impact on our business.
deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with egpc, or threats or acts of terrorism, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our operations in egypt, excluding a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed 24 percent of our 2016 production and accounted for 15 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves and 28 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows.
our operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.
our operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the u.s. dollar and the canadian dollar, and between the u.s. dollar and the british pound. our financial statements, presented in u.s. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other currencies.
22
we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations.
we conduct many of our e&p operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions, either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement. there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest. moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. in either case, the value of our investment may be adversely affected.
we face strong industry competition that may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas exploration and production industry. we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases, properties, and reserves, equipment, and labor required to explore, develop, and operate those properties, and marketing of oil and natural gas production. crude oil and natural gas prices impact the costs of properties available for acquisition and the number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities. many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than we possess and have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. as a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights. in addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as fluctuating worldwide commodity prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels, and the application of government regulations. we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other specialists. these competitive pressures may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.
our insurance policies do not cover all of the risks we face, which could result in significant financial exposure.
exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous, involving natural disasters and other events such as blowouts, cratering, fire and explosion and loss of well control, which can result in damage to or destruction of wells or production facilities, injury to persons, loss of life, or damage to property and the environment. our international operations are also subject to political risk. the insurance coverage that we maintain against certain losses or liabilities arising from our operations may be inadequate to cover any such resulting liability; moreover, insurance is not available to us against all operational risks.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations apache corporation, a delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. apache currently has exploration and production interests in four geographic areas: the u.s., canada, egypt, and the u.k. (north sea). apache also has exploration interests in suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.
during the second quarter of 2016, apache changed its method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting. financial information for all periods has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method of accounting. see note 1-summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements under part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
during 2015, apache sold its australia lng business and oil and gas assets. during 2014, apache sold its operations in argentina. results of operations and cash flows from operations for argentina and australia are reflected as discontinued operations in the company's financial statements for all periods presented. certain historical information has been recast to reflect the results of operations for argentina and australia as discontinued operations.
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k, and the risk factors and related information set forth in part i, item 1a and part ii, item 7a of this form 10-k.
overview of 2016 results the company took decisive action at the start of the significant decline in commodity prices that began in 2014 in order to preserve its financial position, improve its operational capabilities, and to position apache for a lower-for-longer commodity price environment. the cornerstone of its approach has been capital discipline and cost structure rationalization. we accomplished these objectives through a rigorous and more centralized process for capital allocations, more detailed, long-term planning, and relentless pursuit of cost reductions in our operations and overhead structure. apache remained focused on its mission to grow the company for the long-term benefit of its shareholders, allocating a significant portion of its reduced capital spending program to well completion optimization, strategic testing, and strategic acreage acquisitions as opposed to investing its entire capital budget on more near-term production growth.
in september 2016, after more than two years of extensive geological and geophysical work, methodical acreage accumulation, and strategic testing and delineation drilling, apache announced the discovery of a significant new resource play, "alpine high." apache's alpine high acreage lies in the southern portion of the delaware basin, primarily in reeves county, texas. the company has established an acreage position of over 320,000 contiguous net acres, which it acquired at an attractive average cost of approximately $1,300 per acre. since first announcing the alpine high last september, the company has made substantial progress further delineating the opportunity. the company has confirmed an extensive play fairway which spans 55 miles and a 5,000-foot vertical column encompassing five geologic formations, with multiple target zones spanning the hydrocarbon phase window from dry gas to wet gas to oil. we have recently identified an additional landing zone in the woodford formation, and confirmed production from the pennsylvanian. based on these results, apache now believes the drilling locations at alpine high will exceed the 2,000 to 3,000 previously announced. during 2017, we expect to average 4 to 6 drilling rigs at alpine high. a second hydraulic fracturing crew was added at the start of the year to accelerate completions and data collection. using data collected from strategic testing and delineation drilling, the company is now beginning to optimize wells drilled in alpine high using customized targeting, larger fracs, and longer laterals. combined with multi-well pad drilling, the company believes these measures contribute to the optimized development of the area to maximize economic value. the field is expected to have low levels of water production which will also have a positive impact on long-term economics. we are currently installing the infrastructure, which will allow gas sales from the field around mid-year 2017.
daily production of 522 mboe/d decreased only four percent from 2015, despite investing a significant portion of curtailed capital spending on acreage, delineation wells, and infrastructure at alpine high rather than drilling development wells with a focus on maintaining production levels in the shorter-term. the company's ability to maintain production levels is the result of several successful initiatives during the downturn: reduction of apache's cost structure; implementation of a more rigorous and integrated capital allocation and planning process; upgrades to, and expansion of, drilling inventory; and improvements in its capital efficiency, including reduction in service costs. lease operating expenses were 19 percent lower than 2015 and 33 percent lower than 2014. general and administrative expenses decreased 9 percent over the past two years.

during 2016, apache reported a $1.4 billion loss attributable to common stock, or $3.71 per diluted common share, compared to a loss of $10.4 billion, or $27.40 per share in 2015. results for both periods were directly impacted by asset impairments primarily resulting from the significant drop in crude oil prices beginning in late 2014. apache generated $2.5 billion in cash from continuing operating activities in 2016, a decrease of 4 percent from the prior year, as a result of falling commodity prices and lower production following curtailment of exploration and development activity. apache has reduced debt by 24 percent from year-end 2014 levels, while increasing cash by $698 million during the same period. at the end of 2016, in addition to $1.4 billion of cash on hand, apache has $3.5 billion in available committed borrowing capacity.
2017 outlook the company currently plans to increase 2017 capital investments by more than 60 percent over 2016 spending, to approximately $3.1 billion, excluding capital associated with the one-third noncontrolling interest in egypt. the company's 2017 plan assumes $50 per barrel for wti, $51 per barrel for brent indexed crude, $3.15 per mcf for nymex natural gas, and $5.25 per mcf for uk-indexed gas. at these price levels, our capital program will exceed anticipated operating cash flows. based on current strip pricing, the remaining outspend will be funded primarily by proceeds from non-core asset sales, approximately $400 million of which has already occurred. in early 2017, the company entered into put option contracts which will mitigate the downside risk of price volatility while providing full exposure to upside price potential. the put contracts provide an average floor of $50.47 per barrel and cover most of the company's second-half 2017 oil production.
nearly two-thirds, or approximately $2 billion, of apache's capital spending in 2017 will be allocated to the permian basin, primarily in the midland and delaware basins. this allocation includes approximately $500 million for construction of infrastructure at alpine high. the infrastructure at alpine high will include multiple pipeline connections along with compression, gathering, centralized processing facilities and tank batteries designed to accommodate expected volume increases as the play is developed. internationally, apache's capital plan is intended to sustain longer-term free cash flow generation in egypt and the north sea. international spending will account for approximately 30 percent of apache's total 2017 budget, split nearly evenly between egypt and the north sea. apache's 2017 opportunity set in these regions is primarily centered on development drilling and lower-risk, step-out exploration wells, where the company has a long-standing track record of success. apache's remaining capital budget is allocated between its remaining north american regions and an exploration well in suriname expected to commence drilling in the first quarter.
the company anticipates that production volumes will decline through the second quarter of 2017, before showing consistent quarterly growth beginning in the second half of the year. for the full year, the company projects reported production in the range of 486 to 506 mboe/d. production excluding the noncontrolling interest and tax volumes in egypt is expected to be in the range of 398 to 415 mboe/d.
operational highlights apache's deliberate focus on strategic testing and targeted development drilling during the price downturn, in addition to the alpine high discovery, significantly impacted results in its permian basin plays, egypt, and the north sea.
other operational highlights for the year include:
north america
•   north america onshore liquids averaged 171,691 barrels per day, with crude oil representing 65 percent of this liquids production. north america onshore liquids production represented 51 percent of worldwide liquids production and 33 percent of overall production, contributing $1.8 billion of liquids revenues in 2016. onshore equivalent production was down 11 percent relative to 2015 as a result of a significant reduction in exploration and development capital spending during 2015 and 2016.
•   the permian region averaged 5 operated rigs during the year, drilling 132 gross wells, 93 net wells. over half of the region's production is crude oil and 23 percent is ngls. combined, this represents more than a third of apache's total liquids production for 2016. the region averaged 161 mboe/d during 2016 and contributed $1.5 billion of revenues during 2016.
•   the midcontinent/gulf coast region drilled or participated in drilling 35 gross wells, with a 94 percent success rate. the region focused its drilling activities in the woodford-scoop and canyon lime formations during 2016. the region averaged 55 mboe/d during 2016, contributing $378 million of revenues for the year.
•   the canada region drilled or participated in drilling 17 gross wells, with an 88 percent success rate. drilling operations were primarily focused on the region's wapiti montney, ante creek montney, duvernay, and glauconite plays, with a goal of reducing drilling and completion costs. the region averaged 59 mboe/d and contributed $343 million of revenues during 2016.
28
international and offshore
•   the egypt region continued to reduce its drilling program throughout 2016, averaging 6 rigs and drilling 61 gross wells. as a result of the reduced investment in drilling activity over the past several years, gross production decreased one percent. egypt's net production increased 11 percent from 2015, a function of the mechanics of its production-sharing contracts. in december 2016, apache was notified by the egyptian ministry that it was the successful bidder in two new concessions, which will add 1.6 million gross undeveloped acres to its portfolio. apache anticipates these concessions will be signed into law mid-2017. the region averaged 170 net mboe/d and contributed $2.1 billion of revenues during 2016.
•   the north sea region averaged 4 rigs during 2016, drilling 14 gross wells, 11 net wells. during the year, the region averaged production of 68 mboe/d and contributed $970 million of revenues. apache was able to minimize production decline to 4 percent year over year despite a significant reduction in capital expenditures. apache continues to progress the development of its 2015 callater (formerly k) exploration discovery in the beryl area, with first production projected in the second half of 2017. the company continues appraisal activities on two additional 2015 exploration discoveries: the corona discovery, which logged 225 feet total vertical depth net pay in excellent reservoir-quality sandstone, and the seagull discovery, which confirmed 672 feet of net oil pay over a 1,092-foot column in triassic-age sands.

acquisition and divestiture activity over apache's 60-year history, it has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to capitalize quickly and decisively on changes in its industry and economic conditions. a key component of this strategy is to continuously review and optimize apache's portfolio of assets in response to changes. most recently, apache has completed a series of divestitures designed to monetize nonstrategic assets and enhance apache's portfolio in order to strategically allocate resources to more impactful development opportunities. these divestments comprised primarily capital intensive projects and assets that were not accretive to earnings in the near-term, and included all of apache's operations in australia and argentina. these divestments include:
•   australia operations on june 5, 2015, apache's subsidiaries completed the sale of the company's australian subsidiary apache energy limited to a consortium of private equity funds managed by macquarie capital group limited and brookfield asset management inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion. additionally, in october 2015, apache's subsidiaries completed the sale of its 49 percent interest in yara pilbara holdings pty ltd (yphpl), to yara international for total proceeds of $391 million. the effective date of the transaction was january 1, 2015.
•   lng projects on april 2, 2015 and april 10, 2015, apache subsidiaries completed the sale of its interest in the wheatstone lng and kitimat lng projects, respectively, along with accompanying upstream oil and gas reserves to woodside petroleum limited (woodside) for a total cash consideration of $3.7 billion.
•   nonstrategic assets in the anadarko basin and in southern louisiana on december 31, 2014, apache completed the sale of certain anadarko basin and southern louisiana oil and gas assets for approximately $1.3 billion in two separate transactions. in the anadarko basin, apache sold approximately 115,000 net acres in wheeler county, texas, and western oklahoma. in southern louisiana, the company sold working interests in approximately 90,000 net acres. the effective date of both of these transactions was october 1, 2014.
•   certain gulf of mexico deepwater assets on june 30, 2014, apache completed the sale of non-operated interests in the lucius and heidelberg development projects and 11 primary term deepwater exploration blocks in the gulf of mexico for $1.4 billion. the effective date of the transaction was may 1, 2014.
•   nonstrategic canadian assets on april 30, 2014, apache completed the sale of primarily dry gas producing hydrocarbon assets in the deep basin area of western alberta and british columbia, canada, for $374 million. the assets comprise 328,400 net acres in the ojay, noel, and wapiti areas. apache retained 100 percent of its working interest in horizons below the cretaceous in the wapiti area, including rights to the liquids-rich montney and other deeper horizons. the effective date of the transaction was january 1, 2014.
•   argentina operations on march 12, 2014, apache's subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the company's operations in argentina to ypf sociedad anónima for $800 million (subject to customary closing adjustments) plus the assumption of $52 million of bank debt as of june 30, 2013.

crude oil prices a substantial portion of our crude oil production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the company's control. average realized crude oil prices for 2016 were down 14 percent compared to 2015, a direct result of the sharply lower benchmark oil prices over the past year. crude oil prices realized in 2016 averaged $41.63 per barrel.
continued volatility in the commodity price environment reinforces the importance of our asset portfolio. while the market price received for natural gas varies among geographic areas, crude oil tends to trade within a global market. price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction.
natural gas prices natural gas, which currently has a limited global transportation system, is subject to price variances based on local supply and demand conditions. our primary markets include north america, egypt, and the u.k. an overview of the market conditions in our primary gas-producing regions follows:
•   north america has a common market; most of our gas is sold on a monthly or daily basis at either monthly or daily market prices. our north american regions averaged $1.97 per mcf in 2016, down from $2.39 per mcf in 2015.
32
•   in egypt, our gas is sold to egpc, primarily under an industry pricing formula indexed to dated brent crude oil with a minimum gas price of $1.50 per mmbtu and a maximum gas price of $2.65 per mmbtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. overall, the region averaged $2.71 per mcf in 2016, down 7 percent from the prior year.
•   natural gas from the north sea beryl field is processed through the sage gas plant operated by apache. the gas is sold to a third party at the st. fergus entry point of the national grid on a national balancing point index price basis. the region averaged $4.51 per mcf in 2016, a 33 percent decrease from an average of $6.73 per mcf in 2015.
ngl prices apache's ngl production is sold under contracts with prices at market indices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.
crude oil revenues
2016 vs. 2015 crude oil revenues for 2016 totaled $4.2 billion, a $935 million decrease from the 2015 total of $5.1 billion. a 5 percent decrease in average daily production reduced 2016 revenues by $228 million compared to 2015, while 14 percent lower average realized prices decreased revenues by $707 million. average daily production in 2016 was 275.3 mb/d, with prices averaging $41.63 per barrel. crude oil accounted for 78 percent of our 2016 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of our worldwide production.
worldwide crude oil production from continuing operations decreased 14.4 mb/d compared to 2015, primarily the result of reduced drilling activity in response to lower commodity prices and natural decline.
2015 vs. 2014 during 2015, crude oil revenues totaled $5.1 billion, approximately 49 percent lower than the 2014 total of $10.1 billion, driven by a 47 percent decrease in average crude oil prices and a 4 percent decrease in worldwide production. average daily production in 2015 was 289.6 mb/d, with prices averaging $48.31 per barrel. crude oil represented 78 percent of our 2015 oil and gas production revenues and 53 percent of our equivalent production, compared to 79 and 51 percent, respectively, in the prior year. lower realized prices reduced revenues $4.8 billion, while lower production volumes reduced revenues an additional $222 million.
worldwide crude oil production from continuing operations decreased 12.6 mb/d. when excluding production from asset divestitures during 2015 and 2014, crude oil production remained essentially flat as drilling and recompletion activity in our north american onshore regions offset natural decline in all regions.
natural gas revenues
2016 vs. 2015 natural gas revenues for 2016 totaled $1.0 billion, a $209 million decrease from the 2015 total of $1.2 billion. a 4 percent decrease in average production reduced 2016 revenues by $38 million compared to 2015, while 14 percent lower average realized prices decreased revenues by $171 million. average daily production in 2016 was 1,103 mmcf/d, with prices averaging $2.40 per mcf. natural gas accounted for 18 percent of our 2016 oil and gas production revenues and 35 percent of our worldwide production.
worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased 46.5 mmcf/d compared to 2015, primarily the result of reduced drilling activity in response to lower commodity prices and natural decline.
2015 vs. 2014 natural gas revenues of $1.2 billion for 2015 were $841 million lower than 2014, the result of a 31 percent decrease in realized prices and a 16 percent decrease in production volumes. worldwide production decreased 222.4 mmcf/d, lowering revenues by $228 million. realized prices in 2015 averaged $2.80 per mcf, a decrease of $1.23 per mcf compared to 2014, which decreased revenues by $613 million.
worldwide gas production from continuing operations decreased 16 percent. excluding production from asset divestitures during 2015 and 2014, gas production decreased only 2 percent. this decrease was driven primarily by natural decline and well shut-ins in egypt and canada. this decrease was primarily offset by drilling and recompletion activity in north america onshore regions.
33
ngl revenues
2016 vs. 2015 ngl revenues for 2016 totaled $228 million, essentially unchanged from 2015. a 1 percent increase in average production was offset by 1 percent lower average realized prices. average daily production in 2016 was 62.7 mb/d, with prices averaging $9.92 per barrel. ngls accounted for nearly 4 percent of our 2016 oil and gas production revenues and 12 percent of our worldwide production.
2015 vs. 2014 ngl revenues totaled $227 million in 2015, a decrease of $441 million from 2014, the result of a 7 percent decrease in production volumes and a 63 percent decrease in realized prices. worldwide production from continuing operations decreased 4.8 mb/d, reducing revenues by $17 million. realized prices in 2015 averaged $9.98 per barrel, a decrease of $17.30 per barrel, which reduced revenues by $424 million.
operating expenses the table below presents a comparison of our expenses on an absolute dollar basis and an equivalent unit of production (boe) basis. our discussion may reference expenses on a boe basis, on an absolute dollar basis or both, depending on context. all operating expenses include costs attributable to a noncontrolling interest in egypt. operating expenses for all periods exclude discontinued operations in argentina and australia.

(1) for expenses impacted by the timing of 2016 liftings in the north sea, per-boe calculations are based on sales volumes rather than production volumes.
lease operating expenses (loe)
loe includes several key components, such as direct operating costs, repair and maintenance, and workover costs. direct operating costs generally trend with commodity prices and are impacted by the type of commodity produced and the location of properties (i.e., offshore, onshore, remote locations, etc.). fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. they directly impact costs such as power, fuel, and chemicals, which are commodity price based. commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as rig rates, labor, boats, helicopters, materials, and supplies. oil, which contributed more than half of our 2016 production, is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas. repair and maintenance costs are typically higher on offshore properties.
during 2016, loe decreased $360 million, or 19 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2015. on a per-unit basis, loe decreased $1.50, or 16 percent compared to 2015. during 2015, loe decreased $384 million, or 17 percent, on an absolute dollar basis compared to 2014. on a per-unit basis, loe decreased $0.91, or 9 percent, compared to 2014. these reductions reflect our continued focus on cost reductions consistent with the current price environment.
34
gathering and transportation apache generally sells oil and natural gas under two common types of agreements, both of which include a transportation charge. one is a netback arrangement, under which we sell oil or natural gas at the wellhead and collect a lower relative price to reflect transportation costs to be incurred by the purchaser. in this case, we record sales at the netback price received from the purchaser. alternatively, we sell oil or natural gas at a specific delivery point, pay our own transportation to a third-party carrier, and receive a price with no transportation deduction. in this case, we record the separate transportation cost as gathering and transportation costs.
in the u.s. and canada we sell oil and natural gas under both types of arrangements. in the north sea, we pay transportation charges to a third-party carrier. in egypt, our oil and natural gas production that is sold to egpc is primarily under netback arrangements. the egypt crude oil that is exported is sold under both types of arrangements.
2016 vs. 2015  gathering and transportation costs decreased $11 million from 2015. the decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in volumes and rate changes in canada, partially offset by rate changes in the permian basin.
2015 vs. 2014  gathering and transportation costs decreased $62 million from 2014. the decrease was driven primarily by north american onshore divestitures.
taxes other than income taxes other than income primarily consist of u.k. petroleum revenue tax (prt), severance taxes on properties onshore and in state waters off the coast of the u.s., and ad valorem taxes on properties in the u.s. and canada. severance taxes are generally based on a percentage of oil and gas production revenues, while the u.k. prt is assessed on net receipts from qualifying fields in the u.k. north sea. we are subject to a variety of other taxes including u.s. franchise taxes and various canadian taxes, including the freehold mineral tax and saskatchewan resource surcharge.
2016 vs. 2015  taxes other than income in 2016 were $156 million lower than 2015. in the third quarter of this year, the rate of u.k. prt, historically assessed on qualifying fields in the u.k. north sea, was reduced to zero percent effective january 1, 2016.  as a result, u.k. prt decreased $92 million over the comparable 2015 period. severance tax decreased $25 million as a result of the decline in oil and gas production and lower prices. ad valorem taxes decreased $21 million as a result of a decrease in property values in 2016.
2015 vs. 2014  taxes other than income in 2015 were $295 million lower than 2014. u.k. prt decreased $118 million over the comparable 2014 period as the result of decreased production revenues in the north sea from qualifying fields during the year. severance tax decreased $138 million as the result of lower revenues and the divestiture of properties in louisiana and oklahoma. ad valorem taxes decreased $27 million as a result of property divestitures.
exploration expense exploration expense includes unproved leasehold impairments, exploration dry hole expense, geological and geophysical expense, and the costs of maintaining and retaining unproved leasehold properties. the following table presents a summary of these expenses:
for the year ended december 31,
2016                  2015                  2014
(in millions)
unproved leasehold impairments              $272                $2,462                $1,976
dry hole expense                              81                   133                   318
geological and geophysical expense            44                    89                   122
exploration overhead and other                76                    87                    83
$473                $2,771                $2,499
2016 vs. 2015 exploration expenses in 2016 decreased $2.3 billion, or 83 percent, compared to 2015, primarily a result of stabilizing commodity and leasehold prices reducing unproved leasehold impairments during 2016 in all key geographic areas. dry hole expense decreased $52 million primarily as a result of reduced capital spending during 2016. geological and geophysical expense decreased by $45 million during 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of reduced capital spending.
35
2015 vs. 2014 exploration expenses in 2015 increased $272 million, or 11 percent, compared to 2014 as lower commodity prices impacted exploration activity and resulted in unproved leasehold impairments increasing in all key geographic areas. this increase was partially offset by reduced exploration dry hole costs in 2015. dry hole expense was $185 million higher in 2014 as a result of unsuccessful drilling activities expensed in that period associated with wells primarily in the gulf of mexico and egypt. geological and geophysical expense decreased $33 million as a result of fewer seismic purchases in canada during 2015.
general and administrative (g&a) expenses
2016 vs. 2015  g&a expenses increased $30 million, or 8 percent, from 2015. on a per-unit basis, g&a expenses increased $0.23 to $2.15 per boe. the increase in g&a expense was primarily related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense.
2015 vs. 2014 g&a expenses decreased $73 million, or 16 percent, from 2014. on a per-unit basis, g&a expenses decreased $0.15 to $1.92 per boe. these reductions reflect apache's intense focus on driving internal efficiencies and bringing overhead in line with the current commodity price environment. in 2015, we rationalized our entire organizational structure, eliminating layers of management, consolidating office locations, and reducing corporate and regional staffing to more closely align with activity levels expected in the future.
depreciation, depletion and amortization (dd&a)
2016 vs. 2015 oil and gas property dd&a expense of $2.5 billion in 2016 decreased $516 million compared to 2015. the company's oil and gas property dd&a rate decreased $2.09 per boe in 2016 compared to 2015. the primary factor driving both lower absolute dollar expense and lower dd&a per boe rates was the reduction in the company's oil and gas properties as a result of impairments to proved properties in 2015 and 2016. other asset depreciation decreased $166 million compared to 2015 primarily related to a reduction in the company's gas gathering, transmission, and processing (gtp) assets as a result of impairments to gtp assets during 2015.
2015 vs. 2014 oil and gas property dd&a expense decreased $1.2 billion compared to 2014. the company's oil and gas property dd&a rate decreased $4.21 to $15.01 per boe in 2015 compared to 2014. the primary factor driving both lower absolute dollar expense and lower dd&a per boe rates was the reduction in the company's oil and gas properties as a result of impairments to proved properties in 2014 and 2015. other asset depreciation remained relatively flat.
impairments during 2016, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $1.1 billion in connection with fair value assessments, including $486 million for a prt decommissioning asset that is no longer expected to be realizable from future abandonment activities in the north sea, $427 million impairments of oil and gas proved properties in the u.s. and canada, $135 million impairments of certain gtp facilities in the north sea, and $55 million for inventory write-downs.
during 2015, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $9.5 billion, including $7.4 billion impairments of oil and gas proved properties, $1.7 billion impairments of gtp facilities, a $148 million impairment of our yphpl equity method investment sold in the fourth quarter, $163 million impairment of goodwill in our north sea reporting unit, and $55 million for inventory write-downs. oil and gas proved property impairments resulted from lower commodity prices and downward revisions of reserves resulting from changes to the company's development plans in certain areas. gtp impairments included $555 million for facilities in canada, $102 million in the u.s., and $1.1 billion in egypt. the egyptian impairments resulted in net losses for the year in the applicable concessions, significantly reducing tax expense recorded under our production-sharing contracts.
during 2014, the company recorded asset impairments totaling $7.1 billion, including $6.1 billion impairments of oil and gas proved properties, $655 million impairment of assets held for sale, $347 million impairments of goodwill in our u.s. and canadian reporting units, and $32 million for inventory write-downs.

2016 vs. 2015 net financing costs decreased $94 million from 2015. the decrease is primarily related to an increase of $33 million in capitalized interest, a decrease of $22 million in interest expense, and a $39 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt incurred in 2015.
2015 vs. 2014  net financing costs increased $98 million from 2014. the increase is primarily related to a decrease of $70 million in capitalized interest from lower asset balances qualifying for capitalized interest and a $39 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt during 2015, partially offset by a decrease of $13 million in interest expense resulting from lower average debt balances.
provision for income taxes the 2016 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $442 million. during 2016, apache's effective tax rate was impacted primarily by non-cash impairments of the carrying value of the company's oil and gas properties, non-cash impairments of the company's prt decommissioning asset, the impact of the change in u.k. statutory income tax rate, and an increase in the amount of valuation allowances on u.s. and canadian deferred tax assets.
in 2016, the u.k. government enacted finance bill 2016 which provides income tax relief to exploration and production (e&p) companies operating in the north sea through a reduction of supplementary charge from 20 percent to 10 percent, effective january 1, 2016. as a result of the enacted legislation in the third quarter of 2016, the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $238 million related to the remeasurement of the company's december 31, 2015 u.k. deferred income tax liability.
37
in 2015, apache repatriated the sales proceeds from the divestment of its interest in lng projects and australian upstream assets. upon the repatriation of these proceeds, apache recognized a u.s. current income tax liability of $560 million. pursuant to its plan of divestiture of these assets, apache recorded a deferred income tax liability of $560 million on undistributed foreign earnings in 2014.
the 2015 income tax benefit from continuing operations totaled $1.0 billion. the 2015 effective tax rate reflects the tax benefit from $11.9 billion of asset impairments, the recognition of $2.1 billion of deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit carryforwards, and an increase in valuation allowance against the canadian region's net deferred tax assets. separately, the u.k. government enacted finance bill 2015 which provided income tax relief to e&p companies operating in the north sea through a reduction of supplementary charge from 32 percent to 20 percent, effective january 1, 2015. as a result of the enacted legislation, in 2015, apache recorded a deferred tax benefit of $414 million related to the remeasurement of the company's december 31, 2014 u.k. deferred income tax liability.

capital resources and liquidity operating cash flows are the company's primary source of liquidity. we may also elect to utilize available cash on hand, committed borrowing capacity, access to both debt and equity capital markets, or proceeds from the sale of nonstrategic assets for all other liquidity and capital resource needs.
apache's operating cash flows, both in the short-term and the long-term, are impacted by highly volatile oil and natural gas prices, as well as costs and sales volumes. significant changes in commodity prices impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows. these changes potentially impact our liquidity if costs do not trend with changes in commodity prices. historically, costs have trended with commodity prices, albeit on a lag. sales volumes also impact cash flows; however, they have a less volatile impact in the short-term.
apache's long-term operating cash flows are dependent on reserve replacement and the level of costs required for ongoing operations. cash investments are required to fund activity necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proved crude oil and natural gas reserves. future success in maintaining and growing reserves and production is highly dependent on the success of our drilling program and our ability to add reserves economically. deterioration in commodity prices also impacts estimated quantities of proved reserves. during 2016, we recognized negative reserve revisions of approximately 11 percent of our year-end 2015 estimated proved reserves as a result of lower prices. if realized prices for the remainder of 2017 approximate commodity futures prices as of december 31, 2016, the company does not expect additional negative revisions for the year.
the company currently plans to increase 2017 capital investments by more than 60 percent from 2016 spending, to approximately $3.1 billion, excluding capital associated with the one-third noncontrolling interest in egypt. the company's 2017 plan assumes $50 per barrel for wti, $51 per barrel for brent indexed crude, $3.15 per mcf for nymex natural gas, and $5.25 per mcf for uk-indexed gas. at these price levels, our capital program will exceed anticipated operating cash flows. based on current strip pricing, the remaining outspend will be funded primarily by proceeds from non-core asset sales, approximately $400 million of which has already occurred. in early 2017, the company entered into put option contracts which will mitigate the downside risk of price volatility while providing full exposure to upside price potential. nearly two-thirds, or approximately $2 billion, of apache's capital spending in 2017 will be allocated to the permian basin, primarily in the midland and delaware basins. this allocation includes approximately $500 million for construction of infrastructure at alpine high. international spending will account for approximately 30 percent of apache's total 2017 budget, split nearly evenly between egypt and the north sea. apache's remaining capital budget is allocated between its remaining north american regions and an exploration well in suriname expected to commence drilling in the first quarter.
we believe the liquidity and capital resource alternatives available to apache will be adequate to fund short-term and long-term operations, including our capital spending program, repayment of debt maturities, payment of dividends, and any amount that may ultimately be paid in connection with commitments and contingencies.

net cash provided by continuing operating activities operating cash flows are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are impacted, both in the short-term and the long-term, by volatile oil and natural gas prices. the factors that determine operating cash flows are largely the same as those that affect net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as dd&a, asset retirement obligation (aro) accretion, exploratory dry hole expense, asset impairments, and deferred income tax expense.
net cash provided by continuing operating activities for 2016 totaled $2.5 billion, down $101 million from 2015. the decrease primarily reflects lower commodity prices.
for a detailed discussion of commodity prices, production, and expenses, please see "results of operations" in this item 7. for additional detail on the changes in operating assets and liabilities and the non-cash expenses which do not impact net cash provided by operating activities, please see the statement of consolidated cash flows in the consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
australia discontinued operations during 2015, apache completed the sale of its wheatstone lng project and associated upstream assets to woodside for total proceeds of $2.8 billion. during 2015, apache also completed the sale of its australian subsidiary apache energy limited (ael) to a consortium of private equity funds managed by macquarie capital group limited and brookfield asset management inc. for total proceeds of $1.9 billion. the results of operations for the divested australian assets, asset impairments, and losses on disposal are classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k.
39
argentina discontinued operations during 2014, apache completed the sale of our argentina operations and properties to ypf sociedad anónima for cash proceeds of $800 million (subject to customary closing adjustments). the results of operations related to argentina have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this annual report on form 10-k. net cash provided by argentina discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2014 was $2 million.
asset divestitures during 2016, 2015, and 2014, apache recorded proceeds from divestitures totaling $134 million, $1.5 billion, and $3.1 billion, respectively. for information regarding our acquisitions and divestitures, please see note 3-acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
egypt noncontrolling interest sinopec international petroleum exploration and production corporation (sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in apache's oil and gas business in egypt. apache made cash distributions totaling $293 million, $129 million, and $140 million to sinopec in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
capital expenditures during 2016, 2015, and 2014, capital spending for exploration and development (e&d) activities totaled $1.6 billion, $4.2 billion, and $8.6 billion, respectively. this reduction is a direct result of our proactive measures to adjust our capital budget to reflect lower commodity prices and operating cash flows during 2016. apache's e&d capital spending was evenly distributed between our north american onshore and international regions. apache's investment in gas gathering, transmission, and processing facilities totaled $158 million, $233 million, and $881 million during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. gtp expenditures in 2016 primarily comprise investments in infrastructure for the alpine high play.
apache also completed leasehold and property acquisitions totaling $181 million, $367 million, and $1.5 billion in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. our acquisition investments continued to focus on adding new leasehold positions to our north american onshore portfolio.
shares repurchased apache's board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to 40 million shares of the company's common stock. shares may be purchased either in the open market or through privately held negotiated transactions. the company initiated the buyback program on june 10, 2013, and through december 31, 2014, had repurchased a total of 32.2 million shares at an average price of $88.96 per share. the company has not purchased any additional shares during 2016 or 2015 and is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares.
dividends the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for 52 consecutive years through 2016. future dividend payments will depend on the company's level of earnings, financial requirements, and other relevant factors. common stock dividends paid during 2016 totaled $379 million, compared with $377 million in 2015 and $365 million in 2014.

cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2016, we had $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1 billion of cash was held by foreign subsidiaries, and approximately $347 million was held by apache corporation and u.s. subsidiaries. the cash held by foreign subsidiaries should not be subject to additional u.s. income taxes if repatriated. the majority of the cash is invested in highly liquid, investment-grade instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
debt at december 31, 2016, outstanding debt, which consisted of notes and debentures, totaled $8.5 billion. we have $550 million maturing in 2018, $150 million maturing in 2019, $493 million maturing in 2021, and the remaining maturing in years 2022 through 2096. at december 31, 2016, we had $483,000 of notes due march 2017 classified as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
in november 2016, the company initiated a program to purchase in the open market up to $250 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued under its indentures. in the fourth quarter of 2016, apache purchased and canceled $181 million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes through open market repurchases for $182 million in cash, including accrued interest and $0.5 million of premium. these repurchases resulted in a $1 million net loss on extinguishment of debt, which is included in "financing costs, net" in our statement of consolidated operations. the net loss includes an acceleration of related discount and deferred financing costs.
in january 2017, we purchased and canceled an additional $69 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes for $71 million in cash, including accrued interest and $1 million of premium, which completed the open market repurchase program.
available credit facilities in june 2015, the company entered into a five-year revolving credit facility which matures in june 2020, subject to apache's two, one-year extension options. the facility provides for aggregate commitments of $3.5 billion (including a $750 million letter of credit subfacility), with rights to increase commitments up to an aggregate $4.5 billion. proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. apache's available borrowing capacity under this facility supports its commercial paper program. in connection with entry into the $3.5 billion facility, apache terminated $5.3 billion in commitments under existing credit facilities. as of december 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under this credit facility, leaving aggregate available borrowing capacity at $3.5 billion.
at the company's option, the interest rate per annum for borrowings under the 2015 facility is either a base rate, as defined, plus a margin, or the london inter-bank offered rate (libor), plus a margin. the company also pays quarterly a facility fee at a per annum rate on total commitments. the margins and the facility fee vary based upon the company's senior long-term debt rating. at december 31, 2016, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, the libor margin was 1.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent.
the financial covenants of the 2015 credit facility require the company to maintain an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of not greater than 60 percent at the end of any fiscal quarter. for purposes of this calculation, capital excludes the effects of non-cash write-downs, impairments, and related charges occurring after june 30, 2015. at december 31, 2016, the company's debt-to-capital ratio as calculated under the credit facility was 33 percent.
the 2015 facility's negative covenants restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to create liens securing debt on its hydrocarbon-related assets, with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry, purchase money liens, liens on subsidiary assets located outside of the united states and canada, and liens arising as a matter of law, such as tax and mechanics' liens. the company also may incur liens on assets if debt secured thereby does not exceed 5 percent of the company's consolidated assets, or approximately $1.1 billion as of december 31, 2016. negative covenants also restrict apache's ability to merge with another entity unless it is the surviving entity, dispose of substantially all of its assets, and guarantee debt of non-consolidated entities in excess of the stated threshold.
in february 2016, apache entered into a three-year letter of credit facility providing £900 million in commitments, with options to increase commitments to £1.075 billion and extend the term by one year. the facility is available for letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling, u.s. dollars, canadian dollars, and any other foreign currency consented to by an issuing bank. the facility also is available for loans in pounds sterling, u.s. dollars, and canadian dollars to cash collateralize letters of credit or obligations to provide letters of credit, in each case, to the extent letters of credit are unavailable under the facility. the facility's representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default are substantially similar to those in apache's 2015 $3.5 billion revolving credit facility.
41
commissions are payable on letters of credit outstanding under the 2016 facility at a per annum rate equal to a libor margin. borrowings bear interest per annum at a base rate or libor, plus a margin. a facility fee at a per annum rate on aggregate commitments also is payable. letter of credit commissions, the interest margin, and the facility fee vary depending on apache's senior unsecured long-term debt rating. at december 31, 2016, the libor margin was 1.075 percent, the base rate margin was 0.075 percent, and the facility fee was 0.175 percent.
the 2016 facility is available for the company's letter of credit needs, particularly those which may arise in respect of abandonment obligations assumed in various north sea acquisitions. as of december 31, 2016, three letters of credit aggregating approximately £147.5 million and no borrowings were outstanding under this facility.
there are no clauses in the 2015 $3.5 billion or 2016 £900 million credit facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes. the agreements for these facilities do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings. however, the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments for nonpayment and other breaches, and if the company or any of its u.s. or canadian subsidiaries defaults on other indebtedness in excess of the stated threshold, is insolvent, or has any unpaid, non-appealable judgment against it for payment of money in excess of the stated threshold. lenders may also accelerate payment maturity and terminate lending and issuance commitments if the company undergoes a specified change in control or any borrower has specified pension plan liabilities in excess of the stated threshold. the company was in compliance with the terms of these credit facilities as of december 31, 2016.
there is no assurance that the financial condition of banks with lending commitments to the company will not deteriorate. we closely monitor the ratings of the banks in our bank groups. having large bank groups allows the company to mitigate the potential impact of any bank's failure to honor its lending commitment.
commercial paper program as of december 31, 2016, the company has available a $3.5 billion commercial paper program. the commercial paper program generally enables apache to borrow funds for up to 270 days at competitive interest rates. the commercial paper program is fully supported by available borrowing capacity under the company's 2015 $3.5 billion committed credit facility. if the company is unable to issue commercial paper following a significant credit downgrade or dislocation in the market, the company's 2015 committed credit facility, which expires in 2020, is available as a 100 percent backstop. as of december 31, 2016, the company had no borrowings under its commercial paper program.
off-balance sheet arrangements apache enters into customary agreements in the oil and gas industry for drilling rig commitments, firm transportation agreements, and other obligations as described below in "contractual obligations" in this item 7. other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described herein, apache does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or capital resource positions.

(1)   this table does not include the company's liability for dismantlement, abandonment, and restoration costs of oil and gas properties or pension or postretirement benefit obligations. for additional information regarding these liabilities, please see notes 7 and 11, respectively, in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
(2)   this represents our capital lease obligation discounted at 4.4 percent for a midland office building.
(3)   amounts represent any agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. these include minimum commitments associated with long-term take-or-pay contracts, ngl processing agreements, drilling work program commitments, and agreements to secure capacity rights on third-party pipelines. amounts exclude certain product purchase obligations related to marketing and trading activities for which there are no minimum purchase requirements or the amounts are not fixed or determinable.
(4)   amounts include long-term lease payments for office space, aircraft, supply and standby vessels, gas pipeline and land leases, and equipment related to exploration, development, and production activities, such as compressors. the company expects to receive $10 million in sublease income associated with these leases.
apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur. the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement, which is necessary to assess settlements resulting from litigation. apache's management believes that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations, including approximately $51 million for environmental remediation and approximately $15 million for various contingent legal liabilities. for a detailed discussion of the company's environmental and legal contingencies, please see note 10-commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part iv, item 15 of this form 10-k.
in addition to our recorded environmental and legal liabilities, we have potential exposure to future obligations related to divested properties. apache has divested various leases, wells, and facilities located in the gulf of mexico where the purchasers typically assume all obligations to plug, abandon, and decommission the associated wells, structures, and facilities acquired. one or more of the counterparties in these transactions could, either as a result of the severe decline in oil and natural gas prices or other factors related to the historical or future operations of their respective businesses, face financial problems that may have a significant impact on their solvency and ability to continue as a going concern. if a purchaser of our gulf of mexico assets becomes the subject of a case or proceeding under relevant insolvency laws or otherwise fails to perform required abandonment obligations, apache could be required to perform such actions under applicable federal laws and regulations. in such event, we may be forced to use available cash to cover the costs of such liabilities and obligations should they arise.
with respect to our retained oil and gas operations in the gulf of mexico, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) has issued notice to lessees (ntl) no. 2016-n01 pertaining to the obligations of companies to provide supplemental assurances for performance with respect to plugging, abandonment, decommissioning, and site clearance obligations associated with wells, platforms, structures, and facilities located upon or used in connection with such companies' oil and gas leases. under this ntl, the company will likely be required to provide additional security to boem with respect to plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning obligations relating to the company's current ownership interests in various gulf of mexico leases. we are working closely with the boem to make arrangements for the provision of such additional required security, if such security becomes necessary under the new ntl. additionally, we are not able to predict the effect that these changes might have on counterparties to which apache has sold gulf of mexico assets. such changes could cause the bonding obligations of such parties to increase substantially, thereby causing a significant impact on the counterparties' solvency and ability to continue as a going concern.

insurance program we maintain insurance policies that include coverage for physical damage to our assets, general liabilities, workers' compensation, employers' liability, sudden and accidental pollution, and other risks. our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles or retentions that we must satisfy prior to recovering on insurance. additionally, our insurance is subject to policy exclusions and limitations. there is no assurance that our insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
our current insurance policies covering physical damage to our assets provide up to $1 billion in coverage per occurrence. these policies also provide sudden and accidental pollution coverage. coverage for gulf of mexico named windstorms is excluded from this coverage.
our current insurance policies covering general liabilities provide approximately $500 million in coverage, scaled to apache's interest. our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify apache for injuries and death of the service provider's employees as well as subcontractors hired by the service provider.
apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the overseas private investment corporation (opic) and highly-rated insurers covering a portion of its investments in egypt for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks. the islamic corporation for the insurance of investment and export credit (iciec, an agency of the islamic development bank) reinsures opic. in the aggregate, these insurance policies provide up to $750 million of coverage to apache, subject to policy terms and conditions and a retention of approximately $1 billion.
apache has an additional insurance policy with opic, which, subject to policy terms and conditions, provides up to $300 million of coverage through 2024 for losses arising from (1) non-payment by egpc of arbitral awards covering amounts owed apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of egypt prevent apache from exporting our share of production. the multilateral investment guarantee agency (miga), a member of the world bank group, provides $150 million in reinsurance to opic.
future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. in addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable.
critical accounting policies and estimates apache prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. apache identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of apache's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. the following is a discussion of apache's most critical accounting policies.
reserves estimates proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations.
proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time.
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, our reserves are used throughout our financial statements. for example, since we use the units-of-production method to amortize our oil and gas properties, the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd&a expense. a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of reserves could result in property impairments. finally, these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
44
reserves are calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes and future development costs are based on current costs with no escalation.
apache has elected not to disclose probable and possible reserves or reserve estimates in this filing.
oil and gas exploration costs apache accounts for its exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting. costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage are capitalized. costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are also capitalized. oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred. costs associated with drilling an exploratory well are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether proved reserves have been found. on a quarterly basis, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities and determines whether the company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts. if management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are recorded as dry hole expense and reported in exploration expense in the statement of consolidated operations. otherwise, the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized.
long-lived assets long-lived assets used in operations, including proved oil and gas properties, are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group. individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed by management through an established process in which changes to significant assumptions such as prices, volumes, and future development plans are reviewed. if, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. the expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review.
during the past two years, there was a substantial decline in commodity prices. the resulting change in future commodity price assumptions and impact to our future development plan was a triggering event which required us to reassess our long-lived assets for impairment. based on the results of this assessment, we recorded impairments of certain proved oil and gas properties and gathering, transmission, and processing facilities. for discussion of these impairments, see "fair value measurements" of note 1-summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
asset retirement obligation (aro)
the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. apache's removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the north sea and gulf of mexico. estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments. asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety, and public relations considerations.
aro associated with retiring tangible long-lived assets is recognized as a liability in the period in which the legal obligation is incurred and becomes determinable. the liability is offset by a corresponding increase in the underlying asset. the aro liability reflects the estimated present value of the amount of dismantlement, removal, site reclamation, and similar activities associated with apache's oil and gas properties. the company utilizes current retirement costs to estimate the expected cash outflows for retirement obligations. inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.
45
income taxes our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to taxation on income in numerous jurisdictions worldwide. we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns. we routinely assess the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards, the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance. numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices).
the company regularly assesses and, if required, establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates. tax reserves have been established and include any related interest, despite the belief by the company that certain tax positions meet certain legislative, judicial, and regulatory requirements. these reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and any new legislation. the company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments.
purchase price allocation accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities. any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value. estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company's assets and liabilities and tax-related carryforwards at the merger date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost.
in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we made various assumptions. the most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. to estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves as described above in "reserve estimates" of this item 7. estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future.
goodwill as of december 31, 2016, the company's consolidated balance sheet included $87 million of goodwill, all of which has been assigned to the egypt reporting unit. goodwill is assessed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. we conduct a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment as of july 1 of each year, and whenever impairment indicators arise, by examining relevant events and circumstances which could have a negative impact on our goodwill such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, overall financial performance, acquisitions and divestitures, and other relevant entity-specific events.
the first step of the impairment test requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned. if it is necessary to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach.
under the income approach, the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows. the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates, and other variables. negative revisions of estimated reserves quantities, increases in future cost estimates, divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit, or sustained decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices could lead to a reduction in expected future cash flows and possibly an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods.
key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model described above include estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves, including both proved reserves and risk-adjusted unproved reserves; estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves as of the measurement date; and estimates of operating, administrative, and capital costs adjusted for inflation. we discount the resulting future cash flows using discount rates similar to those used by the company in the valuation of acquisitions and divestitures.
46
to assess the reasonableness of our fair value estimate, we use a market approach to compare the fair value to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in the public market. this requires management to make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies, recent comparable asset transactions, and transaction premiums. associated market multiples are applied to various financial metrics of the reporting unit to estimate fair value.
although we base the fair value estimate of each reporting unit on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, and actual results could differ from the estimate. in the event of a prolonged global recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing the fair value of the reporting unit to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.

item 1a.   risk factors.

this annual report on form 10-k contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties including the risks discussed below. the risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business. please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in item 7 of this part 1 under the heading "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations."
risk factors related to our overall business:
if we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, cash flows and stock price.
our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local government regulations, including medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations, federal and state anti-kickback laws, the stark law and analogous state self-referral prohibition statutes, federal acquisition regulations, the false claims act (fca), the civil monetary penalty statute, the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and federal and state laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of patient health information (e.g., health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa)) and the storage, handling and administration of pharmaceuticals. the medicare and medicaid reimbursement rules related to claims submission, enrollment and licensing requirements, cost reporting, and payment processes impose complex and extensive requirements upon dialysis providers as well. moreover, additional laws and regulations potentially affecting providers continue to be promulgated. for example, on december 13, 2016, the 21st century cures act was signed into law and, among other provisions, authorizes the office of inspector general (oig) to impose penalties on providers that engage in information blocking where there is knowledge that such practice is unreasonable and likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of electronic health information.
we endeavor to comply with all legal requirements; however, there is no guarantee that we will be able to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business. we further endeavor to structure all of our relationships with physicians to comply with state and federal anti-kickback and physician self-referral laws. we utilize considerable resources to monitor the laws and implement necessary changes. however, the laws and regulations in these areas are complex and often subject to varying interpretations. for example, if an enforcement agency were to challenge the level of compensation that we pay our medical directors or the number of medical directors whom we engage, we could be required to change our practices, face criminal or civil penalties, pay substantial fines or otherwise experience a material adverse effect as a result of a challenge to these arrangements.
in addition, failure to report and return overpayments within 60 days of when the overpayment was identified can lead to a violation of the fca and associated penalties, as described in further detail below, and exclusion and penalties under the federal civil monetary penalty statute, including civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each item or service for which a person received an identified overpayment and failed to report and return such overpayment. these obligations to report and return overpayments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing overpayments to greater scrutiny. we have made significant investments in resources to decrease the time it takes to identify and process overpayments, and we may be required to make additional investments in the future. from time to time we may conduct internal compliance reviews, the results of which may involve the identification of overpayments or other liabilities. an acceleration in our ability to identify and process overpayments could result in us refunding overpayments to government and other payors more rapidly than we have in the past which could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows. as of december 31, 2016, we recorded an estimated accrual of $38 million for potential damages and liabilities associated with write-offs and discounts of patient co-payment obligations, and credits to payors for returns of prescriptions drugs related to our pharmacy business that were identified during the course of an internally-initiated compliance review. we have disclosed the results of this ongoing review to the government. we may accrue additional reserves for refunds and related damages and potential liabilities arising out of this review.
additionally, the federal government has used the fca to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against medicare and state health care programs, including coding errors, billing for services not rendered, submitting false cost reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code, and billing for care that is not considered medically necessary. moreover, amendments to the federal anti-kickback statute in the health reform law make claims tainted by anti-kickback violations potentially subject to liability under the fca, including qui tam or whistleblower suits. the penalties for a violation of the fca range from $5,500 to $11,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each false claim plus three times the amount of damages caused by each such claim which generally means the amount received directly or indirectly from the government. on february 3, 2017, the department of justice (doj) issued a final rule announcing adjustments to fca penalties, under which the per claim penalty range increases to $10,957 to $21,916 for penalties assessed after february 3, 2017, so long as the underlying conduct occurred after november 2, 2015. given the high volume of claims processed by our various operating units, the potential is high for substantial penalties in connection with any alleged fca violations.
31
in addition to the provisions of the fca, which provide for civil enforcement, the federal government can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government.
the civil investigative demand received by our wholly-owned pharmacy services subsidiary, davita rx, llc, specifically references that it is in connection with an fca investigation concerning allegations that this subsidiary presented or caused to be presented false claims for payment to the government for prescription medications, as well as into our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers. see "item 3. legal proceedings" and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details.
we are subject to a corporate integrity agreement (cia) which, for our domestic dialysis business, requires us to report probable violations of criminal, civil or administrative laws applicable to any federal health care program for which penalties or exclusions may be authorized under applicable healthcare laws and regulations. see "if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement, we could be subject to substantial penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs that may adversely impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows".
if any of our operations are found to violate these or other government regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, cash flows and stock price, including:
•   suspension or termination of our participation in government payment programs;

•   refunds of amounts received in violation of law or applicable payment program requirements;

•   loss of required government certifications or exclusion from government payment programs;

•   loss of licenses required to operate healthcare facilities or administer pharmaceuticals in some of the states in which we operate;

•   reductions in payment rates or coverage for dialysis and ancillary services and related pharmaceuticals;

•   criminal or civil liability, fines, damages or monetary penalties for violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute, stark law violations, fca or other failures to meet regulatory requirements;

•   enforcement actions by governmental agencies and/or state claims for monetary damages by patients who believe their protected health information (phi) has been used, disclosed or not properly safeguarded in violation of federal or state patient privacy laws, including hipaa or the privacy act of 1974;

•   mandated changes to our practices or procedures that significantly increase operating expenses;

•   imposition of and compliance with corporate integrity agreements that could subject us to ongoing audits and reporting requirements as well as increased scrutiny of our billing and business practices which could lead to potential fines;

•   termination of relationships with medical directors; and

•   harm to our reputation which could impact our business relationships, affect our ability to obtain financing and decrease access to new business opportunities, among other things.

we are, and may in the future be, a party to various lawsuits, claims, governmental investigations and audits (including investigations resulting from our obligation to self-report suspected violations of law) and other legal proceedings, any of which could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, substantial payments made by us, harm to our reputation, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in the medicare, medicaid and other federal healthcare programs and possible criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we are the subject of a number of investigations and audits by the federal government. we have received subpoenas or other requests for documents from the federal government in connection with the swoben private civil suit, the 2015 u.s. attorney transportation investigation, the investigations underlying the two subpoenas regarding patient diagnosis coding received by dmg and its jsa subsidiary, the 2015 doj vascular access investigation, the 2016 u.s. attorney prescription drug investigation and the 2017 u.s. attorney american kidney fund investigation. in addition to the foregoing inquiries and proceedings, we are frequently subject to other investigations and audits by state or federal government agencies and/or private civil qui tam complaints filed by relators and other lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings.
32
responding to subpoenas, investigations and other lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings as well as defending ourselves in such matters will continue to require management's attention and cause us to incur significant legal expense. negative findings or terms and conditions that we might agree to accept as part of a negotiated resolution of pending or future government inquiries or relator proceedings could result in, among other things, substantial financial penalties or awards against us, substantial payments made by us, harm to our reputation, required changes to our business practices, exclusion from future participation in the medicare, medicaid and other federal healthcare programs and, in certain cases, criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. it is possible that criminal proceedings may be initiated against us in connection with investigations by the federal government. to our knowledge, no such proceedings have been initiated by the federal government against us at this time. other than as described in "item 3. legal proceedings" and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of the various legal proceedings and regulatory matters to which we are or may be subject from time to time, including those described in the aforementioned sections of this report, or the timing of their resolution or the ultimate losses or impact of developments in those matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, and cash flows. see "item 3. legal proceedings" and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details regarding these and other matters.
disruptions in federal government operations and funding create uncertainty in our industry and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.
a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. if the u.s. government defaults on its debt, there could be broad macroeconomic effects that could raise our cost of borrowing funds, and delay or prevent our future growth and expansion. any future federal government shutdown, u.s. government default on its debt and/or failure of the u.s. government to enact annual appropriations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments.
healthcare reform could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
we cannot predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to the changes brought on by federal and state healthcare reform legislation or what form many of these regulations will take before implementation.
the federal healthcare reform legislation, enacted in 2010, introduced healthcare insurance exchanges which provide a marketplace for eligible individuals and small employers to purchase healthcare insurance. the business and regulatory environment continues to evolve as the exchanges mature, and regulations are challenged, changed and enforced. if commercial payor participation in the exchanges continues to decrease, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected. although we cannot predict the short- or long-term effects of these factors, we believe the healthcare insurance exchanges could result in a reduction in esrd patients covered by traditional commercial insurance policies and an increase in the number of patients covered through the exchanges under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates or higher deductibles and co-payments that patients may not be able to pay. to the extent that the ongoing implementation of such exchanges or changes in regulations or enforcement of regulations regarding the exchanges results in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our services from commercial and/or government payors, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.
the healthcare reform legislation also added several new tax provisions that, among other things, impose various fees and excise taxes, and limit compensation deductions for health insurance providers and their affiliates. these rules could negatively impact our cash flow and tax liabilities. in addition, the healthcare reform legislation broadened the potential for penalties under the fca for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors and reduced the timeline to file medicare claims. as a result, we made significant investments in new resources to accelerate the time it takes us to identify and process overpayments and we deployed significant resources to reduce our timeline and improve our claims processing methods to ensure that our medicare claims are filed in a timely fashion. however, we may be required to make additional investments in the future. failure to timely identify and return overpayments may result in significant penalties, which may have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. failure to file a claim within the one year window could result in payment denials, adversely affecting our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
with the healthcare reform legislation, new models of care emerge and evolve and other initiatives in the government or private sector may arise, which could adversely impact our business. for example, the cms innovation center (innovation center) is currently working with various healthcare providers to develop, refine and implement accountable care organizations (acos) and other innovative models of care for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries, including bundled payments for care improvement initiative, cec model (which includes the development of esrd seamless care organizations), the comprehensive primary care initiative, the duals demonstration, and other models. we are currently participating in the cec model with the innovation center, including with organizations in arizona, florida, and adjacent new jersey and pennsylvania markets. our u.s. dialysis business may
33
choose to participate in additional models either as a partner with other providers or independently. even in areas where we are not directly participating in this or other innovation center models, some of our patients may be assigned to an aco, another esrd care model, or another program, in which case the quality and cost of care that we furnish will be included in an aco's, another esrd care model's, or other program's calculations. additionally, cms instituted new screening procedures which we expect will delay the medicare contractor approval process, potentially causing a delay in reimbursement. we anticipate the new screening and enrollment requirements will require additional personnel and financial resources and will potentially delay the enrollment and revalidation of our centers which in turn will delay payment. these delays may negatively impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
other reform measures allow cms to place a moratorium on new enrollment of providers and to suspend payment to providers upon a credible allegation of fraud from any source. these types of reform measures, as well as other measures, could adversely impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows depending upon the scope and breadth of the implementing regulations.
there is also a considerable amount of uncertainty as to the prospective implementation of the federal healthcare reform legislation and what similar measures might be enacted at the state level. there have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenges to repeal or amend the aca. in addition, the 2016 presidential and congressional elections have caused the future state of the exchanges and other aca reforms to be unclear. as a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the future with respect to the exchanges, and, indeed, many core aspects of the current health care marketplace. while specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent, it does appear likely that there will be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the near and short term. the enacted reforms as well as future legislative changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including lowering our reimbursement rates and increasing our expenses.
in addition, cms published an interim final rule that establishes new conditions for coverage standards for dialysis facilities that require any facility making payments of premiums for individual market health plans to notify patients of potential coverage options and educate them about the benefits of each option. the interim final rule requires facilities to ensure that insurers are informed of and have agreed to accept the payments. on january 25, 2017, the federal court issued a preliminary injunction on cms' interim final rule. at this time cms has not appealed the court's ruling and we await the final decision from the court. this and any other law, rule or guidance or rule issued by cms limiting or prohibiting the use of charitable premium assistance and/or the ability of patients with access to alternative coverage from selecting a marketplace plan on or off exchange could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
federal and state privacy and information security laws are complex, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information on our behalf, or if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems or defend against cybersecurity attacks, we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches, and our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
we must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and privacy of phi, including hipaa and its implementing privacy and security regulations, as amended by the federal health information technology for economic and clinical health act (hitech) and collectively referred to as hipaa. if we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information, including phi, on our behalf, properly maintain the integrity of our data, protect our proprietary rights to our systems, or defend against cybersecurity attacks, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct our operations, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state agents. our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer systems and networks.
we are continuously implementing multiple layers of security measures through technology, processes, and our people. we utilize current security technologies and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. despite these efforts, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to privacy and security incidents; security attacks and breaches; acts of vandalism or theft; computer viruses and other malicious code; coordinated attacks by activist entities; emerging cybersecurity risks; misplaced or lost data; programming and/or human errors; or other similar events that could impact the security, reliability, and availability of our systems. emerging and advanced security threats, including coordinated attacks, require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. cybersecurity requires ongoing investment and diligence against evolving threats.
any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, including phi, financial data, competitively sensitive information, or other proprietary data, whether by us or a third party, could have
34
a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, or to make required notifications. the occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy and security laws, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation and trigger regulatory actions and private party litigation. if we are unable to protect the physical and electronic security and privacy of our databases and transactions, we could be subject to potential liability and regulatory action, our reputation and relationships with our patients and vendors would be harmed, and our business, operations, and financial results may be materially adversely affected. failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems (including our networks) and data, or to defend against cybersecurity attacks, could subject us to monetary fines, civil suits, civil penalties or criminal sanctions and requirements to disclose the breach publicly, and may further result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. as malicious cyber activity escalates, including activity that originates outside of the united states, the risks we face relating to transmission of data and our use of service providers outside of our network, as well as the storing or processing of data within our network, intensify. there have been increased federal and state hipaa and other privacy and security enforcement efforts and we expect this trend to continue. while we maintain cyber liability insurance, this insurance may not cover us for all losses and may not be sufficient to protect us against all losses.
we may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or dispositions, which may affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business, and if businesses we acquire have liabilities we are not aware of, we could suffer severe consequences that would materially and adversely affect our business.
our business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of dialysis centers and other businesses, as well as entry into joint ventures. we may engage in acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures, dispositions or new business models, which may affect our results of operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of our business. there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or merger partners or that, if identified, we will be able to acquire these targets on acceptable terms or agree to terms with merger partners. there can also be no assurance that we will be successful in completing any acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we announce, executing new business models or integrating any acquired business into our overall operations. there is no guarantee that we will be able to operate acquired businesses successfully as stand-alone businesses, or that any such acquired business will operate profitably or will not otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. further, we cannot be certain that key talented individuals at the business being acquired will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will be able to continue to successfully manage or have adequate resources to successfully operate any acquired business.
businesses we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities or liabilities that are in excess of the amounts that we originally estimated, and may have other issues, including those related to internal controls over financial reporting or issues that could affect our ability to comply with healthcare laws and regulations and other laws applicable to our expanded business. as a result, we cannot make any assurances that the acquisitions we consummate will be successful. although we generally seek indemnification from the sellers of businesses we acquire for matters that are not properly disclosed to us, we are not always successful. in addition, even in cases where we are able to obtain indemnification, we may discover liabilities greater than the contractual limits, the amounts held in escrow for our benefit (if any), or the financial resources of the indemnifying party. in the event that we are responsible for liabilities substantially in excess of any amounts recovered through rights to indemnification or alternative remedies that might be available to us, or any applicable insurance, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our earnings and cash flows or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business.
additionally, joint ventures, including our asia pacific joint venture (apac jv), and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment. in addition, we may be dependent on joint venture partners, controlling shareholders or management who may have business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours. business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, controlling shareholders or management may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, result in reputational harm to us or adversely affect the value of our investment or partnership.
if we are not able to continue to make acquisitions, or maintain an acceptable level of non-acquired growth, or if we face significant patient attrition to our competitors or a reduction in the number of our medical directors or associated physicians, it could adversely affect our business.
acquisitions, patient retention and medical director and physician retention are an important part of our growth strategy. we face intense competition from other companies for acquisition targets. in our u.s. dialysis business, we continue to face increased competition from large and medium-sized providers, which compete directly with us for acquisition targets as well as for individual patients and medical directors. in addition, as we continue our international dialysis expansion into various international markets, we will face competition from large and medium-sized providers for these acquisition targets as well. because of the ease of entry into the
35
dialysis business and the ability of physicians to be medical directors for their own centers, competition for growth in existing and expanding markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources. occasionally, we have experienced competition from former medical directors or referring physicians who have opened their own dialysis centers. in addition, fmc, our largest competitor, manufactures a full line of dialysis supplies and equipment in addition to owning and operating dialysis centers. this may give it cost advantages over us because of its ability to manufacture its own products. if we are not able to continue to make acquisitions, continue to maintain acceptable levels of non-acquired growth, or if we face significant patient attrition to our competitors or a reduction in the number of our medical directors or associated physicians, it could adversely affect our business.
our ability to effectively provide the services we offer could be negatively impacted if certain of our suppliers do not meet our needs, if there are material price increases, or if we are unable to effectively access new technology, which could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
we have significant suppliers that are either the sole or primary source of products critical to the services we provide, including amgen, baxter, fmc, nxstage medical, inc. and others or to which we have committed obligations to make purchases. if any of these suppliers do not meet our needs for the products they supply, including in the event of a product recall, shortage or dispute, and we are not able to find adequate alternative sources, if we experience material price increases from these suppliers that we are unable to mitigate, or if some of the drugs that we purchase are not reimbursed or not adequately reimbursed by commercial payors or through the bundled payment rate by medicare, our revenues, earnings and cash flows could be substantially reduced. in addition, the technology related to the products critical to the services we provide is subject to new developments and may result in superior products. if we are not able to access superior products on a cost-effective basis or if suppliers are not able to fulfill our requirements for such products, we could face patient attrition which could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
dmg operates in a different line of business from our historical business, and we face challenges managing dmg and may not realize anticipated benefits.
dmg operates in a different line of business from our historical business. we may not have the expertise, experience and resources to pursue all of our businesses at once, and we may be unable to successfully operate all businesses in the combined company. the administration of dmg requires implementation of appropriate operations, management, and financial reporting systems and controls. we experience difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems. the management of dmg requires and will continue to require the focused attention of our management team, including a significant commitment of its time and resources. the need for management to focus on these matters could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and operating results. if the dmg operations are less profitable than we currently anticipate or we do not have the experience, the appropriate expertise or the resources to pursue all businesses in the combined company, the results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected, and in that regard, we have taken goodwill impairment charges of $189 million, $77 million and $176 million in december 2015, march 2016 and june 2016, respectively, and may continue incurring additional impairment charges.
the level of our current and future debt could have an adverse impact on our business and our ability to generate cash to service our indebtedness depends on many factors beyond our control.
we have substantial debt outstanding, we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt in connection with the dmg transaction and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you, for example, it could:
•   make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt securities;

•   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;

•   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;

•   expose us to interest rate volatility that could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness;

•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and

•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds.

36
in addition, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. the terms of the indentures governing our senior notes and the agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities will allow us to incur substantial additional debt. if new debt is added to current debt levels, the related risks described above could intensify.
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts, including any strategic acquisitions we may make in the future, will depend on our ability to generate cash. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. if we are unable to generate sufficient funds to service our outstanding indebtedness, we may be required to refinance, restructure, or otherwise amend some or all of such obligations, sell assets, or raise additional cash through the sale of our equity. we cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such refinancing on terms as favorable as our existing financing terms or that such restructuring activities, sales of assets, or issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, would raise sufficient funds to meet these obligations.
the borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by a substantial portion of our direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a substantial portion of davita inc.'s and its subsidiaries' assets.
we may be subject to liability claims for damages and other expenses that are not covered by insurance or exceed our existing insurance coverage that could reduce our earnings and cash flows.
our operations and how we manage our company may subject us, as well as our officers and directors to whom we owe certain defense and indemnity obligations, to litigation and liability for damages. our business, profitability and growth prospects could suffer if we face negative publicity or we pay damages or defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope or limits of coverage of any applicable insurance coverage, including claims related to adverse patient events, contractual disputes, professional and general liability and directors' and officers' duties. in addition, we have received several notices of claims from commercial payors and other third parties, as well as subpoenas and cids from the federal government, related to our business practices, including our historical billing practices and the historical billing practices of acquired businesses. although the ultimate outcome of these claims cannot be predicted, an adverse result with respect to one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we currently maintain insurance coverage for those risks we deem are appropriate to insure against and make determinations about whether to self-insure as to other risks or layers of coverage. however, a successful claim, including a professional liability, malpractice or negligence claim which is in excess of any applicable insurance coverage, or that is subject to our self-insurance retentions, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows. additionally, as a result of the broad scope of our dmg division's medical practice, we are exposed to medical malpractice claims, as well as claims for damages and other expenses, that may not be covered by insurance or for which adequate limits of insurance coverage may not be available.
in addition, if our costs of insurance and claims increase, then our earnings could decline. market rates for insurance premiums and deductibles have been steadily increasing. our earnings and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following:
•   the collapse or insolvency of our insurance carriers;

•   further increases in premiums and deductibles;

•   increases in the number of liability claims against us or the cost of settling or trying cases related to those claims; or

•   an inability to obtain one or more types of insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.

37
if we fail to successfully maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, the integrity of our financial reporting could be compromised, which could result in a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.
the integration of dmg into our internal control over financial reporting has required and will continue to require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and will increase our compliance costs. failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results and the market's perception of our business and our stock price.
deterioration in economic conditions and further disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.
deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our profitability. among other things, the potential decline in federal and state revenues that may result from such conditions may create additional pressures to contain or reduce reimbursements for our services from medicare, medicaid and other government sponsored programs. increases in job losses in the u.s. as a result of adverse economic conditions has and may continue to result in a smaller percentage of our patients being covered by an employer group health plan and a larger percentage being covered by lower paying medicare and medicaid programs. employers may also select more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. to the extent that payors are negatively impacted by a decline in the economy, we may experience further pressure on commercial rates, a further slowdown in collections and a reduction in the amounts we expect to collect. in addition, uncertainty in the financial markets could adversely affect the variable interest rates payable under our credit facilities or could make it more difficult to obtain or renew such facilities or to obtain other forms of financing in the future, if at all. any or all of these factors, as well as other consequences of a deterioration in economic conditions which cannot currently be anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.
expansion of our operations to and offering our services in markets outside of the u.s. subjects us to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.
we are continuing to expand our operations by offering our services outside of the u.s., which increases our exposure to the inherent risks of doing business in international markets. depending on the market, these risks include those relating to:
•   changes in the local economic environment;

•   political instability, armed conflicts or terrorism;

•   social changes;

•   intellectual property legal protections and remedies;

•   trade regulations;

•   procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services;

•   foreign currency;

•   repatriating or moving to other countries cash generated or held abroad, including considerations relating to tax-efficiencies and changes in tax laws;

•   export controls;

•   lack of reliable legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights;

•   changes in local laws or regulations;

•   potentially longer ramp-up times for starting up new operations and for payment and collection cycles;

•   financial and operational, and information technology systems integration; and

•   failure to comply with u.s. laws, such as the fcpa, or local laws that prohibit us, our partners, or our partners' or our intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.

issues relating to the failure to comply with any of the above may impact our domestic business and/or raise scrutiny on our domestic practices.
additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international business and operations will be different than those affecting our domestic business and operations. for example, conducting international operations requires us to devote significant management resources to implement our controls and systems in new markets, to comply with local laws and regulations and to overcome the numerous new challenges inherent in managing international operations, including those based on differing languages, cultures and regulatory environments, and those related to the timely hiring, integration and retention of a sufficient number of skilled personnel to carry out operations in an environment with which we are not familiar.
we anticipate expanding our international operations through acquisitions of varying sizes or through organic growth, which could increase these risks. additionally, though we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, there is no assurance that we will be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all. as a result, we would expect these costs to be dilutive to our earnings over the next several years as we start-up or acquire new operations.
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
risk factors related to our u.s. dialysis and related lab services, ancillary services and strategic initiatives:
if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
approximately 36% of our dialysis services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 were generated from patients who have commercial payors (including hospital dialysis services) as their primary payor. the majority of these patients have insurance policies that pay us on terms and at rates that are generally significantly higher than medicare rates. the payments we receive from commercial payors generate nearly all of our profit and all of our nonacute dialysis profits come from commercial payors. we continue to experience downward pressure on some of our commercial payment rates as a result of general conditions in the market, including as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on dialysis services and other factors. in addition, many commercial payors that sell individual plans both on and off exchange have publicly announced losses in the marketplace. these payors may seek discounts on rates for marketplace plans on and off exchange. there is no guarantee that commercial payment rates will not be materially lower in the future.
we are continuously in the process of negotiating existing and potential new agreements with commercial payors who aggressively negotiate terms with us. sometimes many significant agreements are being renegotiated at the same time. in the event that our continual negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. consolidations have significantly increased the negotiating leverage of commercial payors. our negotiations with payors are also influenced by competitive pressures, and we may experience decreased contracted rates with commercial payors or experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. in addition to downward pressure on contracted commercial payor rates, payors have been attempting to design and implement plans to restrict access to coverage, and the duration and/or the breadth of benefits, which may result in decreased payments. in addition, payors have been attempting to impose restrictions and limitations on patient access to commercial exchange plans and non-contracted or out-of-network providers, and in some circumstances designate our centers as out-of-network providers. rates for commercial exchange products and out-of-network providers are on average higher than rates for government products and in-network providers, respectively. in 2017, a number of commercial payors have incorporated policies into their provider manuals refusing to accept charitable premium assistance from bona fide non-profit organizations, such as the american kidney fund, which may impact the number of patients who are able to afford commercial exchange plans. we also believe commercial payors have or will begin to restructure their benefits to create disincentives for patients to select or remain with out-of-network providers and to decrease payment rates for out-of-network providers. decreases in the number of patients with commercial exchange plans, decreases in out-of-network rates and restrictions on out-of-network access, our turning away new patients in instances where we are unable to come to agreement on rates, or decreases in contracted rates could result in a significant decrease in our overall revenues derived from commercial payors. if the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, or if we see a decline in commercial patients, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. for additional details regarding specific risks we face regarding regulatory changes that could result in fewer patients covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates, see the discussion in the risk factor under the heading "healthcare reform could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows."
39
if the number of patients with higher-paying commercial insurance declines, then our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be substantially reduced.
our revenue levels are sensitive to the percentage of our patients with higher-paying commercial insurance coverage. a patient's insurance coverage may change for a number of reasons, including changes in the patient's or a family member's employment status. currently, for a patient covered by an employer group health plan, medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, or earlier, if the patient's employer group health plan coverage terminates. patients with commercial insurance frequently rely on financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the american kidney fund. however, certain payors are challenging our patients' and other providers' patients' ability to utilize assistance from charitable organizations for the payment of premiums, including through litigation and other legal proceedings. regulators have also questioned the use of charitable premium assistance for esrd patients, including cms, which had issued an interim final rule on charitable premium assistance in december 2016. although cms' interim final rule is currently subject to a preliminary injunction issued by a federal court judge, cms or a regulatory agency may issue a new rule to challenge charitable premium assistance. if any of these challenges to kidney patients' use of premium assistance are successful or regulators impose restrictions on the use of financial assistance from such charitable organizations such that these patients are unable to obtain, or continue to receive or receive for a limited duration, such financial assistance, our revenues, earnings, and cash flow could be substantially reduced.
when medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rate we receive for that patient decreases from the employer group health plan rate to the lower medicare payment rate. the number of our patients who have government-based programs as their primary payors could increase and the percentage of our patients covered under commercial insurance plans could be negatively impacted as a result of improved mortality or declining macroeconomic conditions. to the extent there are sustained or increased job losses in the u.s., independent of whether general economic conditions improve, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under commercial plans. we could also experience a further decrease in the payments we receive for services if changes to the healthcare regulatory system result in fewer patients covered under commercial plans or an increase of patients covered under more restrictive commercial plans with lower reimbursement rates. in addition, our continual negotiations with commercial payors under existing and potential new agreements could result in a decrease in the number of our patients covered by commercial plans to the extent that we cannot reach agreement with commercial payors on rates and other terms, resulting in termination or non-renewals of existing agreements and our inability to enter into new agreements. commercial payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost of and/or the eligibility for access to healthcare services, including relative to products on and off the healthcare exchanges. these efforts could impact the number of our patients who are eligible to enroll in commercial insurance plans, and remain on the plans, including plans offered through healthcare exchanges. if there is a significant reduction in the number of patients under higher-paying commercial plans relative to government-based programs that pay at lower rates, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
changes in the structure of and payment rates under the medicare esrd program could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
approximately 42% of our dialysis services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 were generated from patients who have medicare as their primary payor. for patients with medicare coverage, all esrd payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a fixed payment rate to encompass all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including pharmaceuticals that were historically separately reimbursed to the dialysis providers, such as epo, vitamin d analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered or additional services performed. most lab services are also included in the bundled payment. under the esrd prospective payment system (pps), the bundled payments to a dialysis facility may be reduced by as much as 2% based on the facility's performance in specified quality measures set annually by cms through the esrd quality incentive program, which was established by the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008. the bundled payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors.
the current bundled payment system presents certain operating, clinical and financial risks, which include:
•   risk that our rates are reduced by cms. uncertainty about future payment rates remains a material risk to our business. each year, cms publishes a final rule for the esrd prospective payment system (pps), which phases in the reductions to the esrd pps base rate mandated by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 as modified by the protecting access to medicare act of 2014.

•   risk that increases in our operating costs will outpace the medicare rate increases we receive. we expect operating costs to continue to increase due to inflationary factors, such as increases in labor and supply costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.

40
•   risk of federal budget sequestration cuts. as a result of the budget control act of 2011 and the bipartisan budget act of 2015, an annual 2% reduction to medicare payments took effect on april 1, 2013 and has been extended through 2025. these across-the-board spending cuts have affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.

•   risk that, if our clinical systems fail to accurately capture the data we report to cms in connection with claims for which at least part of the government's payments to us is based on clinical performance or patient outcomes or co-morbidities, we might be over-reimbursed by the government which could subject us to certain liability. for example, cms published a final rule that implemented a statute under the aca. this statute requires providers to report and return medicare and medicaid overpayments within the later of (a) 60 days after the overpayment is identified, or (b) the date any corresponding cost report is due, if applicable. an overpayment impermissibly retained under this statute could subject us to liability under the fca, exclusion, and penalties under the federal civil monetary penalty statute.

for additional details regarding the risks we face for failing to adhere to our medicare and medicaid regulatory compliance obligations, see the risk factor below under the heading "if we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, cash flows and stock price."
changes in state medicaid or other non-medicare government-based programs or payment rates could reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
approximately 22% of our dialysis services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 were generated from patients who have state medicaid or other non-medicare government-based programs, such as coverage through the department of veterans affairs (va), as their primary coverage. as state governments and other governmental organizations face increasing budgetary pressure, we may in turn face reductions in payment rates, delays in the receipt of payments, limitations on enrollee eligibility or other changes to the applicable programs. for example, certain state medicaid programs and the va have recently considered, proposed or implemented payment rate reductions.
the va adopted medicare's bundled pps pricing methodology for any veterans receiving treatment from non-va providers under a national contracting initiative. since we are a non-va provider, these reimbursements are tied to a percentage of medicare reimbursement, and we have exposure to any dialysis reimbursement changes made by cms. approximately 2% of our dialysis services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 were generated by the va.
in 2013, we entered into a five-year nationwide dialysis services contract with the va which is subject to one-year renewal periods, consistent with all provider agreements with the va under this contract. during the length of the contract, the va has elected not to make adjustments to reimbursement percentages that are tied to a percentage of medicare reimbursement rates. these agreements provide the va with the right to terminate the agreements without cause on short notice. should the va not renew or cancel these agreements for any reason, we may cease accepting patients under this program and may be forced to close centers, which could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
state medicaid programs are increasingly adopting medicare-like bundled payment systems, but sometimes these payment systems are poorly defined and are implemented without any claims processing infrastructure, or patient or facility adjusters. if these payment systems are implemented without any adjusters and claims processing changes, medicaid payments will be substantially reduced and the costs to submit such claims may increase, which will have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. in addition, some state medicaid program eligibility requirements mandate that citizen enrollees in such programs provide documented proof of citizenship. if our patients cannot meet these proof of citizenship documentation requirements, they may be denied coverage under these programs, resulting in decreased patient volumes and revenue. these medicaid payment and enrollment changes, along with similar changes to other non-medicare government programs could reduce the rates paid by these programs for dialysis and related services, delay the receipt of payment for services provided and further limit eligibility for coverage which could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
changes in clinical practices, payment rates or regulations impacting epo and other pharmaceuticals could adversely affect our operating results, reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows and negatively impact our ability to care for patients.
medicare bundles epo into the pps such that dosing variations do not change the amount paid to a dialysis facility. although some medicaid programs and other payors suggest movement towards a bundled payment system inclusive of epo, some non-medicare payors continue to pay for epo separately from the treatment rate.
additionally, evaluations on the utilization and reimbursement for esas, which have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, and related actions by the u.s. congress and federal agencies, could result in further restrictions on the utilization and
41
reimbursement for esas. commercial payors have increasingly examined their administration policies for epo and, in some cases, have modified those policies. changes in labeling of epo and other pharmaceuticals in a manner that alters physician practice patterns or accepted clinical practices, and/or changes in private and governmental payment criteria, including the introduction of epo administration policies could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. further increased utilization of epo for patients for whom the cost of epo is included in a bundled reimbursement rate, or further decreases in reimbursement for epo and other pharmaceuticals that are not included in a bundled reimbursement rate, could also have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
additionally, as a result of the current high level of scrutiny and controversy, we may be subject to increased inquiries or audits from a variety of governmental bodies or claims by third parties. although we believe our anemia management practices and other pharmaceutical administration practices have been compliant with existing laws and regulations, increased inquiries or audits from governmental bodies or claims by third parties would require management's attention, and could result in significant legal expense. any negative findings could result in substantial financial penalties or repayment obligations, the imposition of certain obligations on and changes to our practices and procedures as well as the attendant financial burden on us to comply with the obligations, or exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement, we could be subject to substantial penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs that may adversely impact our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
in october 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states and relator david barbetta to resolve the then pending 2010 and 2011 u.s. attorney physician relationship investigations and paid $406 million in settlement amounts, civil forfeiture, and interest to the united states and certain states. in connection with the resolution of these matters, and in exchange for the oig's agreement not to exclude us from participating in the federal healthcare programs, we have entered into a five-year cia with the oig. the cia (i) requires that we maintain certain elements of our compliance programs; (ii) imposes certain expanded compliance-related requirements during the term of the cia; (iii) requires ongoing monitoring and reporting by an independent monitor, imposes certain reporting, certification, records retention and training obligations, allocates certain oversight responsibility to the board's compliance committee, and necessitates the creation of a management compliance committee and the retention of an independent compliance advisor to the board; and (iv) contains certain business restrictions related to a subset of our joint venture arrangements, including our agreeing to (1) unwind 11 joint venture transactions that were created through partial divestitures to, or partial acquisitions from, nephrologists, and that cover 26 of our 2,119 clinics that existed at the time we entered into the settlement agreement, all of which have been completed, (2) not enter into certain types of partial divestiture joint venture transactions with nephrologists during the term of the cia, (3) non-enforcement of certain patient-related non-solicitation restrictions, and (4) certain other restrictions. the costs associated with compliance with the cia could be substantial and may be greater than we currently anticipate. in addition, in the event of a breach of the cia, we could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties, and could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs. the oig notified us that it considered us to be previously in breach of the cia because of three implementation deficiencies. while we have remediated the deficiencies and have paid certain stipulated penalties, we cannot provide any assurances that we may not be found in breach of the cia in the future. in general, the costs associated with compliance with the cia, or any liability or consequences associated with a breach, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. for our domestic dialysis business, we are required under the cia to report to the oig (i) probable violations of criminal, civil or administrative laws applicable to any federal health care program for which penalties or exclusions may be authorized under applicable laws and regulations; (ii) substantial overpayments of amounts of money we have received in excess of the amounts due and payable under the federal healthcare program requirements; and (iii) employment of or contracting with individuals ineligible from participating in the federal healthcare programs (we refer to these collectively as reportable events). we have provided the oig notice of reportable events, and we may identify and report additional events in the future. if any of our operations are found to violate government laws and regulations, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, cash flows and stock price, including those consequences described under the risk factor "if we fail to adhere to all of the complex government regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that would substantially reduce our revenues, earnings, cash flows and stock price."
delays in state medicare and medicaid certification of our dialysis centers could adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
before we can begin billing for patients treated in our outpatient dialysis centers who are enrolled in government-based programs, we are required to obtain state and federal certification for participation in the medicare and medicaid programs. as state agencies responsible for surveying dialysis centers on behalf of the state and medicare program face increasing budgetary pressure, certain states are having difficulty keeping up with certifying dialysis centers in the normal course resulting in significant delays in certification. if state governments continue to have difficulty keeping up with certifying new centers in the normal course and we continue to experience significant delays in our ability to treat and bill for services provided to patients covered under government programs, it could cause us to incur write-offs of investments or accelerate the recognition of lease obligations in the event we have to
42
close centers or our centers' operating performance deteriorates, and it could have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
if our joint ventures were found to violate the law, we could suffer severe consequences that would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
as of december 31, 2016, we owned a controlling interest in numerous dialysis-related joint ventures, which represented approximately 24% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016. in addition, we also owned noncontrolling equity investments in several other dialysis related joint ventures. we may continue to increase the number of our joint ventures. many of our joint ventures with physicians or physician groups also have certain physician owners providing medical director services to centers we own and operate. because our relationships with physicians are governed by the federal and state anti-kickback statutes, we have sought to structure our joint venture arrangements to satisfy as many federal safe harbor requirements as we believe are commercially reasonable. however, although our joint venture arrangements do not satisfy all of the elements of any safe harbor under the federal anti-kickback statute, they are not automatically prohibited under the federal anti-kickback statute but are susceptible to government scrutiny. for example, in october 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement with the united states and relator david barbetta to resolve the then pending 2010 and 2011 u.s. attorney physician relationship investigations regarding certain of our joint ventures and paid $406 million in settlement amounts, civil forfeiture, and interest to the united states and certain states. for further details, see "if we fail to comply with our corporate integrity agreement, we could be subject to substantial penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs that could have a material effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows".
there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize, and if we are unable to accurately estimate our revenues and related refund liabilities, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition or have a significant impact on our operating results.
there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis and related lab services revenues and related refund liabilities that we recognize in a reporting period. the billing and collection process is complex due to ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage and other payor issues. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for approximately 187,700 u.s. patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. errors in determining the correct coordination of benefits may result in refunds to payors. revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are also subject to estimating risk related to the amounts not paid by the primary government payor that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage, the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage or the patient. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided. we generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of net revenues for the segment. if our estimates of dialysis and related lab services revenues and related refund liabilities are materially inaccurate, it could impact the timing and the amount of our revenues recognition and have a significant impact on our operating results.
our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our pharmacy services and our international dialysis operations, that we invest in now or in the future may generate losses and may ultimately be unsuccessful. in the event that one or more of these activities is unsuccessful, our revenues, earnings and cash flows may be negatively impacted and we may have to write off our investment and incur other exit costs.
our ancillary services and strategic initiatives currently include pharmacy services, disease management services, vascular access services, esrd clinical research programs, physician services, physician practice management services, direct primary care and our international dialysis operations. we expect to add additional service offerings and pursue additional strategic initiatives in the future as circumstances warrant, which could include healthcare services not related to dialysis. many of these initiatives require or would require investments of both management and financial resources and can generate significant losses for a substantial period of time and may not become profitable. there can be no assurance that any such strategic initiative will ultimately be successful. any significant change in market conditions, or business performance, or in the political, legislative or regulatory environment, may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives.
if any of our ancillary services or strategic initiatives, including our pharmacy services and our international dialysis operations, do not perform as planned, our revenues, earnings and cash flows may be negatively impacted, we may incur a material write-off or an impairment of our investment, including goodwill, in one or more of these activities, or we could incur significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business.
43
if a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
we believe that physicians prefer to have their patients treated at dialysis centers where they or other members of their practice supervise the overall care provided as medical director of the center. as a result, the primary referral source for most of our centers is often the physician or physician group providing medical director services to the center.
our medical director contracts are for fixed periods, generally ten years, and at any given time a large number of them could be up for renewal at the same time. medical directors have no obligation to extend their agreements with us and if we are unable to enforce noncompetition provisions contained in terminated medical director agreements, our former medical directors may choose to provide medical director services for competing providers or establish their own dialysis centers in competition with ours. neither our current nor former medical directors have an obligation to refer their patients to our centers.
opportunities presented by our competitors or different affiliation models in the changing healthcare environment, such as an increase in the number of physicians becoming employed by hospitals or a perceived decrease in the quality of service levels at our centers, may negatively impact a medical director's decision to enter into or extend his or her agreement with us, refer patients to our centers or otherwise negatively impact treatment volumes.
in addition, we may take actions to restructure existing relationships or take positions in negotiating extensions of relationships to assure compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute, stark law and other similar laws. if the terms of any existing agreement are found to violate applicable laws, we may not be successful in restructuring the relationship, which could lead to the early termination of the agreement, or cause the physician to stop referring patients to our dialysis centers. these actions, in an effort to comply with applicable laws and regulations, could negatively impact the decision of physicians to extend their medical director agreements with us or to refer their patients to us. if a significant number of physicians were to cease referring patients to our dialysis centers, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
if there are shortages of skilled clinical personnel or if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate, we may experience disruptions in our business operations and increases in operating expenses.
we are experiencing increased labor costs and difficulties in hiring nurses due to a nationwide shortage of skilled clinical personnel. we compete for nurses with hospitals and other healthcare providers. this nursing shortage may limit our ability to expand our operations. in addition, changes in certification requirements or increases in the required staffing levels for skilled clinical personnel can impact our ability to maintain sufficient staff levels to the extent our teammates are not able to meet new requirements, or we experience a higher than normal turnover rate due to increased competition for qualified clinical personnel. if we are unable to hire skilled clinical personnel when needed, or if we experience a higher than normal turnover rate for our skilled clinical personnel, our operations and treatment growth will be negatively impacted, which would result in reduced revenues, earnings and cash flows.
our business is labor intensive and could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relations with our employees or if union organizing activities result in significant increases in our operating costs or decreases in productivity.
our business is labor intensive, and our results are subject to variations in labor-related costs, productivity and the number of pending or potential claims against us related to labor and employment practices. if political efforts at the national and local level result in actions or proposals that increase the likelihood of union organizing activities at our facilities or if union organizing activities increase for other reasons, or if labor and employment claims, including the filing of class action suits, or work stoppages, trend upwards, our operating costs could increase and our employee relations, productivity, earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected.
complications associated with our billing and collections system could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and operating results.
our billing system is critical to our billing operations. if there are defects in the billing system, we may experience difficulties in our ability to successfully bill and collect for services rendered, including a delay in collections, a reduction in the amounts collected, increased risk of retractions from and refunds to commercial and government payors, an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and noncompliance with reimbursement regulations, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and operating results.
44
risk factors related to dmg:
dmg is subject to many of the same risks to which our dialysis business is subject.
as a participant in the healthcare industry, dmg is subject to many of the same risks as our dialysis business is, as described in the risk factors set forth above in this part i, item 1a, any of which could materially and adversely affect dmg's revenues, earnings or cash flows.
under most of dmg's agreements with health plans, dmg assumes some or all of the risk that the cost of providing services will exceed its compensation.
over 83% of dmg's revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016 is derived from fixed per member per month (pmpm) fees paid by health plans under capitation agreements with dmg or its associated physician groups. while there are variations specific to each arrangement, dmg, through davita health plan of california, inc. (dhpc), a subsidiary of healthcare partners holdings, llc and a restricted knox-keene licensed entity, and, in certain instances, dmg's associated physician groups generally contract with health plans to receive a pmpm fee for professional services and assume the financial responsibility for professional services only. in some cases, the health plans separately enter into capitation contracts with third parties (typically hospitals) who receive directly a pmpm fee and assume contractual financial responsibility for hospital services. in other cases, the health plan does not pay any portion of the pmpm fee to the hospital, but rather administers claims for hospital expenses itself. in both scenarios, dmg enters into managed care-related administrative services agreements or similar arrangements with those third parties (typically hospitals) under which dmg agrees to be responsible for utilization review, quality assurance, and other managed care-related administrative functions and claim payments. as compensation for such administrative services, dmg is entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses; any such risk-share amount to which dmg is entitled is recorded as medical revenues, and dmg is also responsible for a percentage of any short-fall in the event that institutional expenses exceed institutional revenues. to the extent that members require more care than is anticipated, aggregate fixed pmpm amounts, or capitation payments, may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with treatment. if medical expenses exceed estimates, except in very limited circumstances, dmg will not be able to increase the pmpm fee received under these risk agreements during their then-current terms and could, directly or indirectly through its contracts with its associated physician groups, suffer losses with respect to such agreements.
changes in dmg's or its associated physician groups' anticipated ratio of medical expense to revenue can significantly impact dmg's financial results. accordingly, the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported claims, may have a material adverse effect on dmg's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
historically, dmg's and its associated physician groups' medical expenses as a percentage of revenue have fluctuated. factors that may cause medical expenses to exceed estimates include:
•   the health status of members;

•   higher than expected utilization of new or existing healthcare services or technologies;

•   an increase in the cost of healthcare services and supplies, including pharmaceuticals, whether as a result of inflation or otherwise;

•   changes to mandated benefits or other changes in healthcare laws, regulations and practices;

•   periodic renegotiation of provider contracts with specialist physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers;

•   periodic renegotiation of contracts with dmg's affiliated primary care physicians and specialists;

•   changes in the demographics of the participating members and medical trends;

•   contractual or claims disputes with providers, hospitals or other service providers within a health plan's network;

•   the occurrence of catastrophes, major epidemics or acts of terrorism; and

•   the reduction of health plan premiums.

45
risk-sharing arrangements that dmg and its associated physician groups have with health plans and hospitals could result in their costs exceeding the corresponding revenues, which could reduce or eliminate any shared risk profitability.
most of the agreements between health plans and dmg and its associated physician groups contain risk-sharing arrangements under which the physician groups can earn additional compensation from the health plans by coordinating the provision of quality, cost-effective healthcare to members. however, such arrangements may require the physician group to assume a portion of any loss sustained from these arrangements, thereby reducing dmg's net income. under these risk-sharing arrangements, dmg and its associated physician groups are responsible for a portion of the cost of hospital services or other services that are not capitated. the terms of the particular risk-sharing arrangement allocate responsibility to the respective parties when the cost of services exceeds the related revenue, which results in a deficit, or permit the parties to share in any surplus amounts when actual costs are less than the related revenue. the amount of non-capitated medical and hospital costs in any period could be affected by factors beyond the control of dmg, such as changes in treatment protocols, new technologies, longer lengths of stay by the patient and inflation. certain of dmg's agreements with health plans stipulate that risk-sharing pool deficit amounts are carried forward to offset any future years' surplus amounts dmg would otherwise be entitled to receive. dmg accrues for any such risk-sharing deficits. to the extent that such non-capitated medical and hospital costs are higher than anticipated, revenue may not be sufficient to cover the risk-sharing deficits the health plans and dmg are responsible for, which could reduce dmg's revenues and profitability.
renegotiation, renewal or termination of capitation agreements with health plans could have a significant impact on dmg's future profitability.
under most of dmg's and its associated physician groups' capitation agreements with health plans, the health plan is generally permitted to modify the benefit and risk obligations and compensation rights from time to time during the terms of the agreements. if a health plan exercises its right to amend its benefit and risk obligations and compensation rights, dmg and its associated physician groups are generally allowed a period of time to object to such amendment. if dmg or its associated physician group so objects, under some of the risk agreements, the relevant health plan may terminate the applicable agreement upon 90 to 180 days written notice. if dmg or its associated physician groups enter into capitation contracts or other risk sharing arrangements with unfavorable economic terms, or a capitation contract is amended to include unfavorable terms, dmg could, directly or indirectly through its contracts with its associated physician groups, suffer losses with respect to such contract. since dmg does not negotiate with cms or any health plan regarding the benefits to be provided under their medicare advantage plans, dmg often has just a few months to familiarize itself with each new annual package of benefits it is expected to offer. depending on the health plan at issue and the amount of revenue associated with the health plan's risk agreement, the renegotiated terms or termination may have a material adverse effect on our dmg division and the company's future revenues and profitability.
laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which dmg is permitted to conduct its business, and the failure to comply with such laws could subject dmg to penalties or require a restructuring of dmg.
some states have laws that prohibit business entities, such as dmg, from practicing medicine, employing physicians to practice medicine, exercising control over medical decisions by physicians (also known collectively as the corporate practice of medicine) or engaging in certain arrangements, such as fee-splitting, with physicians. in some states these prohibitions are expressly stated in a statute or regulation, while in other states the prohibition is a matter of judicial or regulatory interpretation. of the states in which dmg currently operates, california, colorado, nevada and washington generally prohibit the corporate practice of medicine, and other states may as well.
in california, colorado, nevada and washington, dmg operates by maintaining long-term contracts with its associated physician groups which are each owned and operated by physicians and which employ or contract with additional physicians to provide physician services. under these arrangements, dmg provides management services and, receives a management fee for providing non-medical management services; however, dmg does not represent that it offers medical services, and does not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians or the associated physician groups.
in addition to the above management arrangements, dmg has certain contractual rights relating to the orderly transfer of equity interests in certain of its associated california, colorado, nevada and washington physician groups through succession agreements and other arrangements with their physician equity holders. however, such equity interests cannot be transferred to or held by dmg or by any non-professional organization. accordingly, neither dmg nor dmg's subsidiaries directly own any equity interests in any physician groups in california, colorado, nevada and washington. in the event that any of these associated physician groups fail to comply with the management arrangement or any management arrangement is terminated and/or dmg is unable to enforce its contractual rights over the orderly transfer of equity interests in its associated physician groups, such events could have a material adverse effect on dmg's business, financial condition or results of operations.
it is possible that a state regulatory agency or a court could determine that dmg's agreements with physician equity holders of certain managed california, colorado, nevada and washington associated physician groups as described above, either independently
46
or coupled with the management services agreements with such associated physician groups, are in violation of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. as a result, these arrangements could be deemed invalid, potentially resulting in a loss of revenues and an adverse effect on results of operations derived from such associated physician groups. such a determination could force a restructuring of dmg's management arrangements with associated physician groups in california, colorado, nevada and/or washington, which might include revisions of the management services agreements, including a modification of the management fee and/or establishing an alternative structure that would permit dmg to contract with a physician network without violating the corporate practice of medicine prohibition. there can be no assurance that such a restructuring would be feasible, or that it could be accomplished within a reasonable time frame without a material adverse effect on dmg's operations and financial results. in december 2013, dhpc obtained a restricted knox-keene license in california, which permits dhpc to contract with health plans in california to accept global risk without violating the corporate practice of medicine prohibition. however, dmg and dmg's colorado, nevada and washington associated physician groups, as well as those physician equity holders of associated physician groups who are subject to succession agreements with dmg, could be subject to criminal or civil penalties or an injunction for practicing medicine without a license or aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of medicine.
if dmg's agreements or arrangements with any physician equity holder(s) of associated physicians, physician groups or ipas are deemed invalid under state law, including laws against the corporate practice of medicine, or federal law, or are terminated as a result of changes in state law, or if there is a change in accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) or the interpretation thereof affecting consolidation of entities, it could impact dmg's consolidation of total revenues derived from such associated physician groups.
dmg's financial statements are consolidated in accordance with applicable accounting standards and include the accounts of its majority-owned subsidiaries and certain non-owned dmg-associated and managed physician groups. such consolidation for accounting and/or tax purposes does not, is not intended to, and should not be deemed to, imply or provide to dmg any control over the medical or clinical affairs of such physician groups. in the event of a change in accounting standards promulgated by fasb or in interpretation of its standards, or if there is an adverse determination by a regulatory agency or a court, or a change in state or federal law relating to the ability to maintain present agreements or arrangements with such physician groups, dmg may not be permitted to continue to consolidate the total revenues of such organizations. a change in accounting for consolidation with respect to dmg's present agreement or arrangements would diminish dmg's reported revenues but would not be expected to materially adversely affect its reported results of operations, while regulatory or legal rulings or changes in law interfering with dmg's ability to maintain its present agreements or arrangements could materially diminish both revenues and results of operations.
if dhpc is not able to satisfy financial solvency or other regulatory requirements, we could become subject to sanctions and its license to do business in california could be limited, suspended or terminated.
knox-keene requires healthcare service plans operating in california to comply with financial solvency and other requirements overseen by the california department of managed healthcare (dmhc). under knox-keene, dhpc is required to, among other things:
•   maintain, at all times, a minimum tangible net equity (tne);

•   submit periodic financial solvency reports to the dmhc containing various data regarding performance and financial solvency;

•   comply with extensive regulatory requirements; and

•   submit to periodic regulatory audits and reviews concerning dhpc operations and compliance with knox-keene.

in the event that dhpc is not in compliance with the provisions of knox-keene, we could be subject to sanctions, or limitations on, or suspension of its license to do business in california.
if dmg's associated physician group is not able to satisfy the california dmhc's financial solvency requirements, dmg's associated physician group could become subject to sanctions and dmg's ability to do business in california could be limited or terminated.
the california dmhc has instituted financial solvency regulations to monitor the financial solvency of capitated physician groups. under these regulations, dmg's associated physician group is required to, among other things:
•   maintain, at all times, a minimum cash-to-claims ratio (where cash-to-claims ratio means the organization's cash, marketable securities and certain qualified receivables, divided by the organization's total unpaid claims liability). the regulation currently requires a cash-to-claims ratio of 0.75.

47
•   submit periodic reports to the california dmhc containing various data and attestations regarding performance and financial solvency, including incurred but not reported calculations and documentation, and attestations as to whether or not the organization was in compliance with knox-keene requirements related to claims payment timeliness, had maintained positive tne (i.e., at least $1.00) and had maintained positive working capital (i.e., at least $1.00).

in the event that dmg's associated physician group is not in compliance with any of the above criteria, dmg's associated physician group could be subject to sanctions, or limitations on, or removal of, its ability to do business in california.
reductions in medicare advantage health plan reimbursement rates stemming from recent healthcare reforms and any future related regulations may negatively impact dmg's business, revenue and profitability.
a significant portion of dmg's revenue is directly or indirectly derived from the monthly premium payments paid by cms to health plans for medical services provided to medicare advantage enrollees. as a result, dmg's results of operations are, in part, dependent on government funding levels for medicare advantage programs. any changes that limit or reduce medicare advantage reimbursement levels, such as reductions in or limitations of reimbursement amounts or rates under programs, reductions in funding of programs, expansion of benefits without adequate funding, elimination of coverage for certain benefits, or elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments under programs, could have a material adverse effect on dmg's revenues, earnings and cash flows.
each year, cms issues a final rule to establish the medicare advantage benchmark payment rates for the following calendar year. any reduction to medicare advantage rates to dmg that is greater compared to the industry average rate may have material adverse effect on dmg's operations and cash flows. the final impact of the medicare advantage rates can vary from any estimate we may have and may be further impacted by the relative growth of dmg's medicare advantage patient volumes across markets as well as by the benefit plan designs submitted. it is possible that we may underestimate the impact of the medicare advantage rates on our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows.
we have taken impairment charges against the goodwill of three of our dmg reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarters of 2016 based on continuing developments at our dmg reporting units, including the medicare advantage final benchmark rates for 2017 announced on april 4, 2016, further changes in our expectations concerning future government reimbursement rates and our expected ability to mitigate them, as well as medical cost and utilization trends, underperformance of certain at-risk units in recent quarters and other market conditions. we may also need to take additional goodwill impairment charges against earnings in a future period, depending on the impact of continuing changes on the value of our dmg reporting units. a goodwill impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill is in excess of its implied fair value, and the amount of such non-cash charge, if any, could be significant. in estimating the fair value of our dmg reporting units, we update our forecasts for our at-risk dmg reporting units to reflect the expected future cash flows that we believe market participants would use in determining fair values of our dmg reporting units if they were to acquire these businesses. we and our independent advisors also use certain estimates and key assumptions in determining the estimate of these fair values, including applicable market multiples, discount and long-term growth rates, market data and future reimbursement rates. our estimates of the fair value of our dmg reporting units could differ from the actual values that a market participant would pay for these reporting units.
dmg's medicare advantage revenues may continue to be volatile in the future, which could have a material impact on dmg's ongoing financial performance.
the health reform acts contain a number of provisions that negatively impact medicare advantage plans, which may each have an adverse effect on dmg's revenues, earnings and cash flows. these provisions include the following:
•   medicare advantage benchmarks for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. from 2012 through 2016, medicare advantage benchmark rates were phased down from prior levels. the new benchmarks will be fully phased-in in 2017 and will range between 95% and 115% of the medicare ffs costs, depending on a plan's geographic area. if our costs escalate faster than can be absorbed by the level of revenues implied by these benchmark rates, then it could have a significant negative impact on dmg's earnings and cash flows.

•   rebates received by medicare advantage plans that were reduced, with larger reductions for plans failing to receive certain quality ratings.

•   the secretary of hhs has been granted the explicit authority to deny medicare advantage plan bids that propose significant increases in cost sharing or decreases in benefits. if the bids submitted by plans contracted with dmg are denied, this would have a significant negative impact on dmg's revenues, earnings and cash flows.

48
•   medicare advantage plans with medical loss ratios below 85% are required to pay a rebate to the secretary of hhs. the rebate amount is the total revenue under the contract year multiplied by the difference between 85% and the plan's actual medical loss ratio. the secretary of hhs will halt enrollment in any plan failing to meet this ratio for three consecutive years, and terminate any plan failing to meet the ratio for five consecutive years. if a dmg-contracting medicare advantage plan experiences a limitation on enrollment or is otherwise terminated from the medicare advantage program, dmg may suffer materially adverse consequences to its business or financial condition.

•   prescription drug plans are required to provide coverage of certain drug categories on a list developed by the secretary of hhs, which could increase the cost of providing care to medicare advantage enrollees, and thereby reduce dmg's revenues and earnings. the medicare part d premium amount subsidized for high-income beneficiaries has been reduced, which could lower the number of medicare advantage enrollees, which would have a negative impact on dmg's revenues, earnings and cash flows.

•   cms increased coding intensity adjustments for medicare advantage plans beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2018, which reduces cms payments to medicare advantage plans, which in turn will likely reduce the amounts payable to dmg and its associated physicians, physician groups, and ipas under its capitation agreements.

however, the 2016 presidential and congressional elections have caused the future state of the health reform acts to be unclear. while specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent, enacted reforms and future legislative changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
there is also uncertainty regarding both medicare advantage payment rates and beneficiary enrollment, which, if reduced, would reduce dmg's overall revenues and net income. for example, although the congressional budget office (cbo) predicted in 2010 that medicare advantage participation would drop substantially by 2020, the cbo now predicts that enrollment in medicare advantage (and other contracts covering medicare parts a and b) could reach 30 million by 2026. although medicare advantage enrollment increased by approximately 5.6 million, or by 50%, between the enactment of the aca in 2010 and 2015, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue. further, fluctuation in medicare advantage payment rates are evidenced by cms's annual announcement of the expected average change in revenue from the prior year: for 2015, cms announced an average increase of 0.4%; for 2016, 1.25%; and for 2017, 0.85%. uncertainty over medicare advantage enrollment and payment rates present a continuing risk to dmg's business.
medicare advantage enrollment continues to be highly concentrated among a few payors, both nationally and in local markets. in 2017, in 439 counties in 26 states, only one company will offer medicare advantage plans- an indicator that those markets may lack competition. consolidation among medicare advantage plans, or the medicare program's failure to attract additional plans to participate in the medicare advantage program, could have a negative impact of dmg's revenues, earnings, and/or cash flows.
dmg's operations are dependent on competing health plans and, at times, a health plan's and dmg's economic interests may diverge.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, 63% of dmg's consolidated capitated medical revenues were earned through contracts with three health plans.
dmg expects that, going forward, substantially all of its revenue will continue to be derived from its contracts with health plans. each health plan may immediately terminate any of dmg's contracts and/or any individual credentialed physician upon the occurrence of certain events. they may also amend the material terms of the contracts under certain circumstances. failure to maintain the contracts on favorable terms, for any reason, would materially and adversely affect dmg's results of operations and financial condition. a material decline in the number of members could also have a material adverse effect on dmg's results of operations.
notwithstanding each health plan's and dmg's current shared interest in providing service to dmg's members who are enrolled in the subject health plans, the health plans may have different and, at times, opposing economic interests from those of dmg. the health plans provide a wide range of health insurance services across a wide range of geographic regions, utilizing a vast network of providers. as a result, they and dmg may have different views regarding the proper pricing of services and/or the proper pricing of the various service providers in their provider networks, the cost of which dmg bears to the extent that the services of such service providers are utilized. these health plans may also have different views than dmg regarding the efforts and expenditures that they, dmg, and/or other service providers should make to achieve and/or maintain various quality ratings. in addition, several health plans have acquired or announced their intent to acquire provider organizations. if health plans with which dmg contracts acquire a significant number of provider organizations, they may not continue to contract with dmg or contract on less favorable terms or seek to prevent dmg from acquiring or entering into arrangements with certain providers. similarly, as a result of changes in laws, regulations, consumer preferences, or other factors, the health plans may find it in their best interest to provide health insurance services pursuant to another payment or reimbursement structure. in the event dmg's interests diverge from the interests of the health plans, dmg may have limited
49
recourse or alternative options in light of its dependence on these health plans. there can be no assurances that dmg will continue to find it mutually beneficial to work with these health plans. as a result of various restrictive provisions that appear in some of the managed care agreements with health plans, dmg may at times have limitations on its ability to cancel an agreement with a particular health plan and immediately thereafter contract with a competing health plan with respect to the same service area.
dmg and its associated physicians, physician groups and ipas and other physicians may be required to continue providing services following termination or renegotiation of certain agreements with health plans.
there are circumstances under federal and state law pursuant to which dmg and its associated physician groups, ipas and other physicians could be obligated to continue to provide medical services to dmg members in their care following a termination of their applicable risk agreement with health plans and termination of the receipt of payments thereunder. in certain cases, this obligation could require the physician group or ipa to provide care to such member following the bankruptcy or insolvency of a health plan. accordingly, the obligations to provide medical services to dmg members (and the associated costs) may not terminate at the time the applicable agreement with the health plan terminates, and dmg may not be able to recover its cost of providing those services from the health plan, which could have a material adverse effect on dmg's financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
dmg operates primarily in california, florida, nevada, new mexico, washington and colorado and may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions.
dmg derives substantially all of its revenue from operations in california, florida, nevada, new mexico, washington and colorado (which we refer to as the existing geographic regions). as a result, dmg's exposure to many of the risks described herein is not mitigated by a greater diversification of geographic focus. furthermore, due to the concentration of dmg's operations in the existing geographic regions, it may be adversely affected by economic conditions, natural disasters (such as earthquakes or hurricanes), or acts of war or terrorism that disproportionately affect the existing geographic regions as compared to other states and geographic markets.
to expand the operations of its network outside of the existing geographic regions, dmg must devote resources to identify and explore perceived opportunities. thereafter, dmg must, among other things, recruit and retain qualified personnel, develop new offices, establish potential new relationships with one or more health plans, and establish new relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers. the ability to establish such new relationships may be significantly inhibited by competition for such relationships and personnel in the healthcare marketplace in the targeted new geographic regions. additionally, dmg may face the risk that a substantial portion of the patients served in a new geographic area may be enrolled in a medicare ffs program and will not desire to transition to a medicare advantage program, such as those offered through the health plans that dmg serves, or they may enroll with other health plans with whom dmg does not contract to receive services, which could reduce substantially dmg's perceived opportunity in such geographic area. in addition, if dmg were to seek to expand outside of the existing geographic regions, dmg would be required to comply with laws and regulations of states that may differ from the ones in which it currently operates, and could face competitors with greater knowledge of such local markets. dmg anticipates that any geographic expansion may require it to make a substantial investment of management time, capital and/or other resources. there can be no assurance that dmg will be able to establish profitable operations or relationships in any new geographic markets.
reductions in the quality ratings of the health plans dmg serves could have an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flow.
as a result of the health reform acts, the level of reimbursement each health plan receives from cms is dependent, in part, upon the quality rating of the medicare plan. such ratings impact the percentage of any cost savings rebate and any bonuses earned by such health plan. since a significant portion of dmg's revenue is expected to be calculated as a percentage of cms reimbursements received by these health plans with respect to dmg members, reductions in the quality ratings of a health plan that dmg serves could have an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
given each health plan's control of its plans and the many other providers that serve such plans, dmg believes that it will have limited ability to influence the overall quality rating of any such plan. in addition, cms has begun terminating plans that have had a rating of less than three stars for three consecutive years, whereas medicare advantage plans with five stars are permitted to conduct enrollment throughout almost the entire year. accordingly, since low quality ratings can potentially lead to the termination of a plan that dmg serves, dmg may not be able to prevent the potential termination of a contracting plan or a shift of patients to other plans based upon quality issues which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on dmg's results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
50
dmg's records and submissions to a health plan may contain inaccurate or unsupportable information regarding risk adjustment scores of members, which could cause dmg to overstate or understate its revenue and subject it to various penalties.
dmg, on behalf of itself and its associated physicians, physician groups and ipas, submits to health plans claims and encounter data that support the medicare risk adjustment factor (raf) scores attributable to members. these raf scores determine, in part, the revenue to which the health plans and, in turn, dmg is entitled for the provision of medical care to such members. the data submitted to cms by each health plan is based, in part, on medical charts and diagnosis codes prepared and submitted by dmg. each health plan generally relies on dmg and its employed or affiliated physicians to appropriately document and support such raf data in dmg's medical records. each health plan also relies on dmg and its employed or affiliated physicians to appropriately code claims for medical services provided to members. erroneous claims and erroneous encounter records and submissions could result in inaccurate pmpm fee revenue and risk adjustment payments, which may be subject to correction or retroactive adjustment in later periods. this corrected or adjusted information may be reflected in financial statements for periods subsequent to the period in which the revenue was recorded. dmg might also need to refund a portion of the revenue that it received, which refund, depending on its magnitude, could damage its relationship with the applicable health plan and could have a material adverse effect on dmg's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
in june 2015, we received a subpoena from the oig requesting information relating to our and our subsidiaries' (including dmg's and its subsidiary jsa's) provision of services to medicare advantage plans and related patient diagnosis coding and risk adjustment submissions and payments. see "item 3. legal proceedings" and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further details.
additionally, cms audits medicare advantage plans for documentation to support raf-related payments for members chosen at random. the medicare advantage plans ask providers to submit the underlying documentation for members that they serve. it is possible that claims associated with members with higher raf scores could be subject to more scrutiny in a cms or plan audit. there is a possibility that a medicare advantage plan may seek repayment from dmg should cms make any payment adjustments to the medicare advantage plan as a result of its audits. the plans also may hold dmg liable for any penalties owed to cms for inaccurate or unsupportable raf scores provided by dmg. in addition, dmg could be liable for penalties to the government under the fca that range from $5,500 to $11,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. on february 3, 2017, the doj issued a final rule announcing adjustments to fca penalties, under which the per claim penalty range increases to $10,957 to $21,916 for penalties assessed after february 3, 2017, so long as the underlying conduct occurred after november 2, 2015.
cms has indicated that payment adjustments will not be limited to raf scores for the specific medicare advantage enrollees for which errors are found but may also be extrapolated to the entire medicare advantage plan subject to a particular cms contract. cms has described its audit process as plan-year specific and stated that it will not extrapolate audit results for plan years prior to 2011. because cms has not stated otherwise, there is a risk that payment adjustments made as a result of one plan year's audit would be extrapolated to prior plan years after 2011.
there can be no assurance that a health plan will not be randomly selected or targeted for review by cms or that the outcome of such a review will not result in a material adjustment in dmg's revenue and profitability, even if the information dmg submitted to the plan is accurate and supportable.
separately, as described in further detail in "item 3. legal proceedings" and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, on march 13, 2015, jsa, a subsidiary of dmg, received a subpoena from the oig that relates, in part, to risk adjustment practices and data.
a failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical expense could adversely affect dmg's profitability.
patient care costs include estimates of future medical claims that have been incurred by the patient but for which the provider has not yet billed dmg. these claim estimates are made utilizing actuarial methods and are continually evaluated and adjusted by management, based upon dmg's historical claims experience and other factors, including an independent assessment by a nationally recognized actuarial firm. adjustments, if necessary, are made to medical claims expense and capitated revenues when the assumptions used to determine dmg's claims liability changes and when actual claim costs are ultimately determined.
due to the inherent uncertainties associated with the factors used in these estimates and changes in the patterns and rates of medical utilization, materially different amounts could be reported in dmg's financial statements for a particular period under different conditions or using different, but still reasonable, assumptions. it is possible that dmg's estimates of this type of claim may be inadequate in the future. in such event, dmg's results of operations could be adversely impacted. further, the inability to estimate
51
these claims accurately may also affect dmg's ability to take timely corrective actions, further exacerbating the extent of any adverse effect on dmg's results.
dmg faces certain competitive threats which could reduce dmg's profitability and increase competition for patients.
dmg faces certain competitive threats based on certain features of the medicare programs, including the following:
•   as a result of the direct and indirect impacts of the health reform acts, many medicare beneficiaries may decide that an original medicare ffs program is more attractive than a medicare advantage plan. as a result, enrollment in the health plans dmg serves may decrease.

•   managed care companies offer alternative products such as regional preferred provider organizations (ppos) and private ffs plans. medicare ppos and private ffs plans allow their patients more flexibility in selecting physicians than medicare advantage health plans, which typically require patients to coordinate care with a primary care physician. the medicare prescription drug, improvement, and modernization act of 2003 has encouraged the creation of regional ppos through various incentives, including certain risk corridors, or cost reimbursement provisions, a stabilization fund for incentive payments, and special payments to hospitals not otherwise contracted with a medicare advantage plan that treat regional plan enrollees. the formation of regional medicare ppos and private ffs plans may affect dmg's relative attractiveness to existing and potential medicare patients in their service areas.

•   the payments for the local and regional medicare advantage plans are based on a competitive bidding process that may indirectly cause a decrease in the amount of the pmpm fee or result in an increase in benefits offered.

•   the annual enrollment process and subsequent lock-in provisions of the health reform acts may adversely affect dmg's level of revenue growth as it will limit the ability of a health plan to market to and enroll new medicare beneficiaries in its established service areas outside of the annual enrollment period.

•   cms allows medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in a medicare advantage plan with a quality rating of 4.5 stars or less to enroll in a 5-star rated medicare advantage plan at any time during the benefit year. therefore, dmg may face a competitive disadvantage in recruiting and retaining medicare beneficiaries.

in addition to the competitive threats intrinsic to the medicare programs, competition among health plans and among healthcare providers may also have a negative impact on dmg's profitability. for example, due to the large population of medicare beneficiaries, dmg's existing geographic regions have become increasingly attractive to health plans that may compete with dmg. dmg may not be able to continue to compete profitably in the healthcare industry if additional competitors enter the same market. if dmg cannot compete profitably, the ability of dmg to compete with other service providers that contract with competing health plans may be substantially impaired. furthermore, if dmg is unable to obtain new members or experiences a loss of existing members to competitors during the open enrollment period for medicare it could have a material adverse effect on dmg's financial condition and results of operations.
dmg competes directly with various regional and local companies that provide similar services in dmg's existing geographic regions. dmg's competitors vary in size and scope and in terms of products and services offered. dmg believes that some of its competitors and potential competitors may be significantly larger than dmg and have greater financial, sales, marketing and other resources. furthermore, it is dmg's belief that some of its competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves.
a disruption in dmg's healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on dmg's operations and profitability.
in any particular service area, healthcare providers or provider networks could refuse to contract with dmg, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs, disruption of benefits to dmg's members, or difficulty in meeting applicable regulatory or accreditation requirements. in some service areas, healthcare providers or provider networks may have significant market positions. if healthcare providers or provider networks refuse to contract with dmg, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts, or place dmg at a competitive disadvantage, then dmg's ability to market or to be profitable in those service areas could be adversely affected. dmg's provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large provider group. any disruption in dmg's provider networks could result in a loss of members or higher healthcare costs.
52
dmg's revenues and profits could be diminished if dmg fails to retain and attract the services of key primary care physicians.
key primary care physicians with large patient enrollment could retire, become disabled, terminate their provider contracts, get lured away by a competing independent physician association or medical group, or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with dmg or its associated physicians, physician groups or ipas. in addition, dmg's associated physicians, physician groups and ipas could view the business model as unfavorable or unattractive to such providers, which could cause such associated physicians, physician groups or ipas to terminate their relationships with dmg. moreover, given limitations relating to the enforcement of post-termination noncompetition covenants in california, it would be difficult to restrict a primary care physician from competing with dmg's associated physicians, physician groups or ipas. as a result, members who have been served by such physicians could choose to enroll with competitors' physician organizations or could seek medical care elsewhere, which could reduce dmg's revenues and profits. moreover, dmg may not be able to attract new physicians to replace the services of terminating physicians or to service its growing membership.
participation in aco programs is subject to federal regulation, supervision, and evolving regulatory developments that may result in financial liability.
the health reform acts established medicare shared savings programs (mssp) for acos, which took effect in january 2012. under the mssp, eligible organizations are accountable for the quality, cost and overall care of medicare beneficiaries assigned to an aco and may be eligible to share in any savings below a specified benchmark amount. the secretary of hhs is also authorized, but not required, to use capitation payment models with acos. dmg has formed an mssp aco through a subsidiary, which operates in california, florida, and nevada and is evaluating whether to participate in more acos in the future. the continued development and expansion of acos will have an uncertain impact on dmg's revenue and profitability. we also are participating as a dialysis provider in arizona, florida, new jersey, and pennsylvania for the innovation center's cec model.
the aco programs are relatively new and therefore operational and regulatory guidance is limited. it is possible that the operations of dmg's subsidiary aco may not fully comply with current or future regulations and guidelines applicable to acos, may not achieve quality targets or cost savings, or may not attract or retain sufficient physicians or patients to allow dmg to meet its objectives. additionally, poor performance could put the dmg aco at financial risk with a potential obligation to cms. traditionally, other than ffs billing by the medical clinics and healthcare facilities operated by dmg, dmg has not directly contracted with cms and has not operated any health plans or provider sponsored networks. therefore, dmg may not have the necessary experience, systems or compliance to successfully achieve a positive return on its investment in the aco or to avoid financial or regulatory liability. dmg believes that its historical experience with fully delegated managed care will be applicable to operation of its subsidiary aco, but there can be no such assurance.
california hospitals may terminate their agreements with healthcare partners affiliates medical group and davita health plan of california, inc. (formerly healthcare partners plan, inc., and, together with healthcare partners affiliates medical group, amg) or reduce the fees they pay to dmg.
in california, amg maintains significant hospital arrangements designed to facilitate the provision of coordinated hospital care with those services provided to members by amg and its associated physicians, physician groups and ipas. through contractual arrangements with certain key hospitals, amg provides utilization review, quality assurance and other management services related to the provision of patient care services to members by the contracted hospitals and downstream hospital contractors. in the event that any one of these key hospital agreements is amended in a financially unfavorable manner or is otherwise terminated, such events could have a material adverse effect on dmg's financial condition, and results of operations.
dmg's professional liability and other insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover dmg's potential liabilities.
dmg maintains primary professional liability insurance and other insurance coverage through california medical group insurance company, risk retention group, an arizona corporation in which dmg is the majority owner, and through excess coverage contracted through third-party insurers. dmg believes such insurance is adequate based on its review of what it believes to be all applicable factors, including industry standards. nonetheless, potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations, the amount of insurance coverage and/or related reserves may be inadequate, or the amount of any dmg self-insured retention may be substantial. there can be no assurances that dmg will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future, or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost-effective basis, if at all. moreover, even if claims brought against dmg are unsuccessful or without merit, dmg would have to defend itself against such claims. the defense of any such actions may be time-consuming and costly and may distract dmg management's attention. as a result, dmg may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate its business.
53
changes in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements may adversely affect dmg operations.
any negative changes in governmental capitation or ffs rates or methods of reimbursement for the services dmg provides could have a significant adverse impact on dmg's revenue and financial results. since governmental healthcare programs generally reimburse on a fee schedule basis rather than on a charge-related basis, dmg generally cannot increase its revenues from these programs by increasing the amount it charges for its services. moreover, if dmg's costs increase, dmg may not be able to recover its increased costs from these programs. government and private payors have taken and may continue to take steps to control the cost, eligibility for, use, and delivery of healthcare services due to budgetary constraints, and cost containment pressures as well as other financial issues. dmg believes that these trends in cost containment will continue. these cost containment measures, and other market changes in non-governmental insurance plans have generally restricted dmg's ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental payors, any increased costs that dmg experiences. dmg's business and financial operations may be materially affected by these cost containment measures, and other market changes.
dmg's business model depends on numerous complex management information systems and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm dmg's operations and result in potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations.
dmg depends on a complex, specialized, and integrated management information system and standardized procedures for operational and financial information, as well as for dmg's billing operations. dmg may experience unanticipated delays, complications or expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating these integrated systems. moreover, dmg may be unable to enhance its existing management information system or implement new management information systems where necessary. dmg's management information system may require modifications, improvements or replacements that may require both substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations. dmg's ability to implement and operate its integrated systems is subject to the availability of information technology and skilled personnel to assist dmg in creating and maintaining these systems.
dmg's failure to successfully implement and maintain all of its systems could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, dmg's failure to successfully operate its billing systems could lead to potential violations of healthcare laws and regulations. if dmg is unable to handle its claims volume, or if dmg is unable to pay claims timely, dmg may become subject to a health plan's corrective action plan or de-delegation until the problem is corrected, and/or termination of the health plan's agreement with dmg. this could have a material adverse effect on dmg's operations and profitability. in addition, if dmg's claims processing system is unable to process claims accurately, the data dmg uses for its incurred but not reported (ibnr) estimates could be incomplete and dmg's ability to accurately estimate claims liabilities and establish adequate reserves could be adversely affected. finally, if dmg's management information systems are unable to function in compliance with applicable state or federal rules and regulations, including medical information confidentiality laws such as hipaa, possible penalties and fines due to this lack of compliance could have a material adverse effect on dmg's financial condition, and results of operations.
dmg may be impacted by eligibility changes to government and private insurance programs.
due to potential decreased availability of healthcare through private employers, the number of patients who are uninsured or participate in governmental programs may increase. the health reform acts have increased the participation of individuals in the medicaid program in states that elected to participate in the expanded medicaid coverage. a shift in payor mix from managed care and other private payors to government payors as well as an increase in the number of uninsured patients may result in a reduction in the rates of reimbursement to dmg or an increase in uncollectible receivables or uncompensated care, with a corresponding decrease in net revenue. changes in the eligibility requirements for governmental programs such as the medicaid program under the health reform acts and state decisions on whether to participate in the expansion of such programs also could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs and the number of uninsured patients. even for those patients who remain in private insurance plans, changes to those plans could increase patient financial responsibility, resulting in a greater risk of uncollectible receivables. these factors and events could have a material adverse effect on dmg's business, financial condition and results of operations.
negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally or dmg in particular could adversely affect dmg's results of operations or business.
negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally, the medicare advantage program or dmg in particular, may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices that further increase dmg's costs of doing business and adversely affect dmg's results of operations or business by:
•   requiring dmg to change its products and services;

54
•   increasing the regulatory, including compliance, burdens under which dmg operates, which, in turn, may negatively impact the manner in which dmg provides services and increase dmg's costs of providing services;

•   adversely affecting dmg's ability to market its products or services through the imposition of further regulatory restrictions regarding the manner in which plans and providers market to medicare advantage enrollees; or

•   adversely affecting dmg's ability to attract and retain members.

risk factors related to ownership of our common stock:
provisions in our charter documents, compensation programs and delaware law may deter a change of control that our stockholders would otherwise determine to be in their best interests.
our charter documents include provisions that may deter hostile takeovers, delay or prevent changes of control or changes in our management, or limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may otherwise determine to be in their best interests. these include provisions prohibiting our stockholders from acting by written consent; requiring 90 days advance notice of stockholder proposals or nominations to our board of directors (or 120 days for nominations made using proxy access); and granting our board of directors the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without the need for further stockholder approval.
most of our outstanding employee stock-based compensation awards include a provision accelerating the vesting of the awards in the event of a change of control. we also maintain a change of control protection program for our employees who do not have a significant number of stock awards, which has been in place since 2001, and which provides for cash bonuses to the employees in the event of a change of control. based on the market price of our common stock and shares outstanding on december 31, 2016, these cash bonuses would total approximately $493 million if a change of control transaction occurred at that price and our board of directors did not modify this program. these change of control provisions may affect the price an acquirer would be willing to pay for our company.
we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law that, subject to exceptions, would prohibit us from engaging in any business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that stockholder became an interested stockholder.
these provisions may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company at a price that our stockholders may find attractive. these provisions could also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.

forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k, including this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, contains statements that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. all statements that do not concern historical facts are forward-looking statements and include, among other things, statements about our expectations, beliefs, intentions and/or strategies for the future. these forward-looking statements include statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, including the expected impact of the policy change for medicaid patients seeking affordable care act (aca) plans, including on our future operating income and other impacts of this policy change, expectations for treatment growth rates, revenue per treatment, expense growth, levels of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, operating income, cash flow, operating cash flow, estimated tax rates, estimated charges and accruals, capital expenditures, the development of new dialysis centers and dialysis center acquisitions, government and commercial payment rates, revenue estimating risk and the impact of our level of indebtedness on our financial performance, and including earnings per share. these statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, including risks resulting from the concentration of profits generated by higher-paying commercial payor plans for which there is continued downward pressure on average realized payment rates, and a reduction in the number of patients under such plans, which may result in the loss of revenues or patients, and the extent to which the ongoing implementation of healthcare exchanges or changes in regulations or enforcement of regulations regarding the exchanges results in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our services from and/or the number of patients enrolled in higher-paying commercial plans, a reduction in government payment rates under the medicare esrd program or other government-based programs, the impact of the cms medicare advantage benchmark structure, risks arising from potential federal and/or state legislation that could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability, the impact of the 2016 congressional and presidential elections on the current health care marketplace and on our business, including with respect to the future of the aca, the exchanges, and many other core aspects of the current health care marketplace, changes in pharmaceutical or anemia management practice patterns, payment policies, or pharmaceutical pricing, legal compliance risks, including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the provisions of our current corporate integrity agreement (cia), and current or potential investigations by various government entities and related government or private-party proceedings, the restrictions on our business and operations required by the cia and other settlement terms, and the financial impact thereof, continued increased competition from large- and medium-sized dialysis providers that compete directly with us, our ability to maintain contracts with physician medical directors, changing affiliation models for physicians, and the emergence of new models of care introduced by the government or private sector that may erode our patient base and reimbursement rates such as accountable care organizations (acos), independent practice associations (ipas) and integrated delivery networks, our ability to complete acquisitions, mergers or dispositions that we might be considering or announce, or to integrate and successfully operate any business we may acquire or have acquired, including davita medical group (dmg), or to expand our operations and services to markets outside the u.s., or to businesses outside of dialysis and dmg's business, the variability of our cash flows, the risk that we might invest material amounts of capital and incur significant costs in connection with the growth and development of our international operations, yet we might not be able to operate them profitably anytime soon, if at all, risks arising from the use of accounting estimates, judgments and interpretations in our financial statements, the risk that laws regulating the corporate practice of medicine could restrict the manner in which dmg conducts its business, the risk that the cost of providing services under dmg's agreements may exceed our compensation, the risk that reductions in reimbursement rates, including medicare advantage rates, and future regulations may negatively impact dmg's business, revenue and profitability, the risk that dmg may not be able to successfully establish a presence in new geographic regions or successfully address competitive threats that could reduce its profitability, the risk that a disruption in dmg's healthcare provider networks could have an adverse effect on dmg's business operations and profitability, the risk that reductions in the quality ratings of health maintenance organization plan customers of dmg could have an adverse effect on dmg's business, or the risk that health plans that acquire health maintenance organizations may not be willing to contract with dmg or may be willing to contract only on less favorable terms, and the other risk factors set forth in part ii, item 1a. of this annual report on form 10-k. we base our forward-looking statements on information currently available to us at the time of this annual report on form 10-k, and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of changes in underlying factors, new information, future events or otherwise.
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and "item 1. business".

company overview the company consists of two major divisions, davita kidney care (kidney care) and davita medical group (dmg). kidney care is comprised of our u.s. dialysis and related lab services, our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our international operations, and our corporate administrative support. our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business is our largest line of business, which is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services in the u.s. for patients suffering from chronic kidney failure, also known as end stage renal disease (esrd). dmg is a patient- and physician-focused integrated healthcare delivery and management company with over two decades of providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner.
our overall financial performance for 2016 in u.s. dialysis and related lab services benefited from increased treatment volume, primarily from non-acquired growth at existing and new dialysis centers, cost control initiatives, and payor mix improvements in our dialysis business. this was partially offset by an increase in labor costs and other center related costs. dmg experienced a decrease in adjusted operating income primarily due to a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursement rates and an increase in medical costs.
some of our major accomplishments and financial operating performance indicators in 2016 and year over year were as follows:
•   improved clinical outcomes in our u.s. dialysis operations, including third consecutive year as a leader in cms' five -star quality rating system;

•   consolidated net revenue growth of 7.0%;

•   5.7% total net revenue growth in our u.s. dialysis segment, including an increase of $4 per treatment;

•   improved performance in our normalized non-acquired u.s. dialysis treatment growth of 4.2%, which contributed to an increase of approximately 4.5% in the overall number of u.s. dialysis treatments;

•   net increase of 99 u.s. dialysis centers and 36 international dialysis centers;

•   an increase in dmg's net revenue of 7.2% related to an increase in its fee-for-service (ffs) business from the acquisition of the everett clinic medical group (tec);

•   formation of a strategic joint venture in our asia-pacific market;

•   an increase in other ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenue of 17.3%; and

•   strong operating cash flows of $1.963 billion.

we believe that 2017 will be challenging due to the uncertainty around the aca and the ability of our patients to utilize charitable premium assistance, average commercial rate pressure, increases in clinical costs due to inflation, employee turnover and other factors affecting u.s. dialysis and related lab services. in addition, the 2016 presidential and congressional elections have caused the future state of the exchanges and other aca reforms and the healthcare landscape in general to be very unclear. dmg continues to face challenges due to announced decreases in medicare advantage and medicaid reimbursement rates as the government continues to modify the rate structure. we also remain committed to our international expansion plans that will continue to require investment.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2016, we have excluded goodwill impairment charges of $253 million related to our dmg reporting units and $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an impairment of $15 million related to a minority equity investment, the loss on sale of our dmg arizona business of $10 million, estimated accruals for damages and liabilities associated with our dmg nevada hospice business of $16 million and our pharmacy business of $16 million, an adjustment to reduce receivables associated with the dmg acquisition escrow provision relating to income tax items of $31 million, the gain on changes in ownership interest upon the formation of the asia pacific joint venture (apac jv) of $374 million and the gain related to the sale of a portion of our tandigm ownership interest of $40 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we have excluded estimated goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $210 million primarily related to certain dmg reporting units, an estimated accrual of $22 million for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, which is included in general and administrative expenses, and $495 million related to a settlement charge in connection with a private civil suit. in addition, for the year ended december 31, 2014, we have excluded $17 million, related to a loss contingency accrual for the settlement of the 2010 and 2011 u.s. attorney physician relationship investigations. these are non-gaap measures and are not intended as substitutes for the equivalent gaap measures. we have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. as a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normal prior period results.

consolidated net revenues consolidated net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $963 million, or 7.0%, from 2015. this increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $496 million, principally due to solid volume growth from additional treatments from non-acquired growth, one additional treatment day in 2016, and an increase of $4 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, as discussed below. consolidated net revenues also increased due to an increase in dmg's net revenues of $277 million, primarily due to an increase in ffs revenues from acquisitions and an increase in senior capitated revenues, as described below. in addition, revenue increased by approximately $239 million in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and an increase in net revenues from our expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives.
66
consolidated net revenues for 2015 increased by approximately $987 million, or 7.7%, from 2014. this increase in consolidated net revenues was due to an increase in dialysis and related lab services net revenues of approximately $431 million, principally due to solid volume growth from additional treatments from non-acquired growth and from an increase of $6 in the average dialysis revenue per treatment, primarily from an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvement in our commercial payor mix. consolidated net revenues also increased by $335 million as a result of dmg's growth from acquisitions and timing of the recognition of additional medicaid risk sharing revenue, as described below. in addition, revenue increased by approximately $243 million in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives driven primarily from growth in our pharmacy services and our disease management services, as well as expansion in our international operations. these increases were partially offset by an increase in reserves for refunds of prior period pharmacy reimbursements.
consolidated operating income consolidated operating income of $1.895 billion for 2016, which includes impairment charges of $296 million, estimated accruals for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy and dmg nevada hospice businesses of $32 million, an adjustment to reduce receivables associated with the dmg acquisition escrow provision of $31 million, and the net gain on the apac jv, tandigm and dmg arizona ownership changes of $404 million, increased by approximately $724 million from 2015, which included estimated impairment charges of approximately $210 million, an estimated pharmacy accrual of $22 million and a private litigation settlement charge of $495 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted consolidated operating income for 2016 would have decreased by $49 million. adjusted consolidated operating income decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in adjusted operating income related to dmg of $105 million, partially offset by an increase in adjusted operating income for the dialysis and related lab services of $22 million and a decrease in adjusted operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives of $30 million, each discussed in detail below.
consolidated operating income of $1.171 billion for 2015, which included estimated impairment charges of approximately $210 million, an estimated pharmacy accrual of $22 million and a private litigation settlement charge of $495 million, decreased by approximately $644 million from 2014, which included a $17 million loss contingency accrual. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted consolidated operating income for 2015 would have increased by $66 million, or 3.6%. adjusted consolidated operating income increased primarily as a result of an increase in adjusted operating income in dialysis and related lab services of $100 million and an increase in adjusted operating income at dmg of $25 million, partially offset by an increase in the amount of adjusted operating losses in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives of $53 million, each discussed in detail below.
u.s. dialysis and related lab services business our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services through a network of 2,350 outpatient dialysis centers which we own and manage through management services agreements, in 46 states and the district of columbia, serving a total of approximately 187,700 patients. we also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately 900 hospitals. we estimate that we have approximately a 36% market share in the u.s. based upon the number of patients that we serve. in 2016, our overall network of u.s. outpatient dialysis centers increased by 99 dialysis centers primarily as a result of opening new dialysis centers and from acquisitions of existing dialysis centers. in addition, the overall number of patients that we serve in the u.s. increased by approximately 4.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015.
our dialysis and related lab services stated mission is to be the provider, partner and employer of choice. we believe our attention to these three stakeholders-our patients, our business partners, and our teammates-represents the major driver of our long-term performance, although we are subject to the impact of several external factors such as government policy, physician practice patterns, commercial payor payment rates and the mix of commercial and government patients. two principal non-financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover. we have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes, which we refer to as the davita quality index (dqi). our clinical outcomes as measured by dqi have improved over each of the past several years which we believe directly decreases patient mortalities. our patient mortality percentages have decreased from 19.0% in 2001 to 13.8% in 2015. for the third consecutive year, we continue to be a leader in the industry under both the cms qip and five-star quality rating systems. over the last two years our clinical teammate turnover has increased slightly, causing productivity to slightly decrease; however, despite this, we have continued to improve our clinical performance. we will continue to focus on these three stakeholders and our clinical outcomes as we believe these are fundamental long-term value drivers.
we believe our national scale, size and commitment to our patients, among other things, allows us to provide industry-leading quality care with superior clinical outcomes that attracts patients, referring physicians, and qualified medical directors to our network, which provides our dialysis patient base with a large number of out-patient dialysis centers to choose from with convenient locations and access to a full range of other integrated services which provides us the ability to effectively and efficiently manage a patient's care and certain costs while still maintaining strong legal and compliance programs.

the following graph summarizes our dialysis services revenues by modality for the year ended december 31, 2016:
outpatient hemodialysis 79%, peritoneal dialysis and home-based hemodialysis 16%, hospital inpatient hemodialysis 5%
approximately 62% of our 2016 consolidated net revenues were derived directly from our dialysis and related lab services business. approximately 79% of our 2016 dialysis and related lab services revenues were derived from outpatient hemodialysis services in the 2,316 u.s. dialysis centers that we consolidate. other dialysis services, which are operationally integrated with our dialysis operations, are peritoneal dialysis, home-based hemodialysis, hospital inpatient hemodialysis services and management and administrative services provided to dialysis centers in which we own a noncontrolling interest or which are wholly owned by third parties. these services collectively accounted for the balance of our 2016 dialysis and related lab services revenues.
the principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are:
•   the number of treatments, which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring approximately three treatments per week as well as, to a lesser extent, the number of treatments for peritoneal dialysis services and home-based dialysis and hospital inpatient dialysis services; and

•   average dialysis revenue per treatment, including the mix of commercial and government patients.

the total patient base is a relatively stable factor, which we believe is influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis services as indicated by the united states renal data system which reported an approximate compound growth rate of 3.8% from 2000 to 2014 for the dialysis patient population, our relationships with referring physicians, together with the quality of our clinical care which can lead to reduced patient mortality rates as indicated above, and our ability to open and acquire new dialysis centers.
our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment is driven by changes in our mix of commercial and government (principally medicare and medicaid) patients, commercial and government payment rates, and our billing and collecting operations performance.
on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients in relation to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. the percentage of commercial patients covered under contracted plans as compared to commercial patients with out-of-network providers continued to increase, which can significantly affect our average dialysis revenue per treatment since commercial payment rates for patients with out-of-network providers are on average higher than in-network payment rates that are covered under commercial contracted plans. for the last two years, the growth of our commercial patients slightly outpaced the growth of our government-based patients as more of our patients are covered by commercial contracted plans.
government dialysis-related payment rates in the u.s. are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy. for patients with medicare coverage, all esrd payments for dialysis treatments are made under a single bundled payment rate which provides a fixed payment rate encompassing all goods and services provided during the dialysis treatment, including certain pharmaceuticals, such as epogen® (epo), vitamin d analogs and iron supplements, irrespective of the level of pharmaceuticals administered to the patient or additional services performed. most lab services are also included in the bundled payment. the bundled payment rate is also adjusted for certain patient characteristics, a geographic usage index and certain other factors.
the bundled payment system presents operating, clinical and financial risks. for example, with regard to the expanded list of case-mix adjustors, there is a risk that our dialysis centers or billing and other systems may not accurately document and track the
68
appropriate patient-specific characteristics, resulting in a reduction or overpayment in the amounts of the payments that we would otherwise be entitled to receive.
an important provision in the law is an annual adjustment, or market basket update, to the esrd prospective payment system (pps) base rate. absent action by congress, the pps base rate is automatically updated annually by a formulaic inflation adjustment.
in december 2013, cms issued the 2014 final rule for the esrd pps, which phases in the payment reductions mandated by atra, as modified by the protecting access to medicare act of 2014 which reduced our market basket inflation adjustment by 1.25% in 2016 and will reduce our market basket inflation adjustment by 1.25% in 2017 and 1% in 2018. cms recently published the 2017 final rule for the esrd pps and projects it will (i) increase the total payments to all esrd facilities by 0.73% in 2017 compared to 2016; (ii) increase total payments to hospital-based esrd facilities by 0.9% in 2017 compared to 2016; and (iii) increase total payments for freestanding facilities by 0.7% in 2017 compared to 2016. the 2017 final rule for the esrd pps also implements the trade preferences extension act of 2015 provisions regarding the coverage and payment for renal dialysis services furnished by esrd facilities to individuals with acute kidney injury.
as a result of the bca and subsequent activity in congress, a $1.2 trillion sequester (across-the-board spending cuts) in discretionary programs took effect on march 1, 2013. in particular, a 2% reduction to medicare payments took effect on april 1, 2013, which was subsequently extended through 2014 and 2015. the bipartisan budget act of 2015 extended the bca's annual 2% reduction to medicare payments through fiscal year 2025. these across-the-board spending cuts have affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows.
the cms innovation center is currently working with various healthcare providers to develop, refine and implement acos and other innovative models of care for medicare and medicaid beneficiaries. we are currently uncertain of the extent to which the long-term operation and evolution of these models of care, including acos, bundled payments for care improvement initiative, the cec model (which includes the development of escos), the comprehensive primary care initiative, the duals demonstration, or other models, will impact the healthcare market over time. our u.s. dialysis business may choose to participate in one or several of these models either as a partner with other providers or independently. we currently participate in the cec model with the innovation center, including with the esco organizations in the arizona, florida, and adjacent new jersey and pennsylvania markets. in areas where davita is not directly participating in this or other innovation center models, some of our patients may be assigned to an aco, another esrd care model, or another program, in which case the quality and cost of care that we furnish will be included in an aco's, another esrd care model's or other programs' calculations. as new models of care emerge and evolve, we may be at risk of losing our medicare patient base, which would have a materially adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flow. other initiatives in the government or private sector may also arise, including the development of models similar to acos, ipas and integrated delivery networks or evolutions of those concepts which could adversely impact our business.
we anticipate that we will continue to experience increases in our operating costs in 2017 that will outpace any net medicare rate increases that we may receive, which could significantly impact our operating results. in addition, we expect to continue experiencing increases in operating costs that are subject to inflation, such as labor and supply costs, regardless of whether there is a compensating inflation-based increase in medicare payment rates or in payments under the bundled payment rate system.
dialysis payment rates from commercial payors can vary and a major portion of our commercial rates are set at contracted amounts with payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure. our commercial payment rates also include payments for out-of-network patients that on average are higher than our in-network commercial contract rates. we continue to enter into some commercial contracts covering certain patients that will primarily pay us a single bundled payment rate for all dialysis services provided to these patients. however, some contracts will pay us for certain other services and pharmaceuticals in addition to the bundled payment. we are continuously in the process of negotiating agreements with our commercial payors, and if our negotiations result in overall commercial contract payment rate reductions in excess of our commercial contract payment rate increases, our revenues and operating results could be negatively impacted. in addition, if there is an increase in job losses in the u.s., or depending upon changes to the healthcare regulatory system by cms and/or the impact of healthcare insurance exchanges, we could experience a decrease in the number of patients covered under traditional commercial insurance plans. patients with commercial insurance who cannot otherwise maintain coverage frequently rely on financial assistance from charitable organizations, such as the american kidney fund. if these patients are unable to obtain or continue to receive such financial assistance, our revenues, earnings, and cash flows could be substantially reduced. for further details, see the risk factor in item 1a risk factors under the heading "if patients in commercial plans are subject to restriction in plan designs or the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows."
our operating performance with respect to dialysis services billing and collection can also be a significant factor in the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment we recognize and are able to collect. over the past several years we have invested heavily in upgrades to our systems and internal processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduced our regulatory compliance risks, and we expect to continue to improve these systems and processes. we continue to
69
upgrade our billing and other systems and modify our processes to improve our ability to capture the necessary patient characteristics, co-morbidities and certain other factors under medicare's bundled payment system. we believe this will potentially enable us to capture additional reimbursement amounts from medicare and enhance our overall billing and collection performance. however, as we continue to make upgrades to our systems and processes, or as payors change their systems and requirements, such as changes to medicare's billing codes, we could experience a negative impact to our cash collection performance, which would affect our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment.
our dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks. our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectability of our billings as of the reporting date based upon our actual historical collection experience. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current period financial statements based upon on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies.
our annual average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment was approximately $352, $348 and $342 for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in 2016, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately $4 per treatment due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix. in 2015, the average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment increased by approximately $6 per treatment due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix, partially offset by an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts.
our average dialysis and related lab services revenue per treatment can be significantly impacted by several major factors, including our commercial payment rates; government payment policies regarding reimbursement amounts for dialysis treatments covered under medicare's bundled payment rate system, including our ability to capture certain patient characteristics; and changes in the mix of government and commercial patients and the number of commercial patients that are either covered under commercial contracts or are out of network.
the principal drivers of our dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment, labor rates, vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals, utilization levels of pharmaceuticals, business infrastructure costs, which include the operating costs of our dialysis centers, and certain professional fees. however, other cost categories can also represent significant cost variability, such as employee benefit costs, payroll taxes, insurance costs and medical supply costs. our average clinical hours per treatment, or productivity levels, declined slightly in 2016 compared to 2015. we are always striving for improved productivity levels, however, changes in federal and state policies or regulatory billing requirements can lead to increased labor costs in order to implement these new requirements, which can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels. in addition, improvements in the u.s. economy have stimulated additional competition for skilled clinical personnel resulting in slightly higher teammate turnover in 2016, which we believe negatively affected productivity levels. in 2016 and 2015, we experienced an increase in our clinical labor rates of approximately 2.8% and 0.9%, respectively, as clinical labor rates have increased, consistent with general industry trends, mainly due to the high demand for skilled clinical personnel, along with general inflation increases. we also continue to experience increases in our infrastructure and operating costs of our dialysis centers, primarily due to the number of new dialysis centers opened, and general increases in rent, utilities and repairs and maintenance. in 2016, we continued to implement certain cost control initiatives to manage our overall operating costs, including labor productivity.
our dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses represented 8.2% of our dialysis and related lab services net revenues in both 2016 and 2015. although relatively flat as a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses increased by $42 million, primarily due to an increase in labor and benefit costs and legal costs, partially offset by lower long-term incentive compensation. increases in general and administrative expenses over the last several years primarily related to strengthening our dialysis business, improving our regulatory compliance and other operational processes, responding to certain legal and compliance matters, and professional fees associated with enhancing our information technology systems. we expect that these levels of expenditures on our dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses will continue in 2017 and could possibly increase as we seek out new business opportunities within the dialysis industry and continue to invest in improving our information technology infrastructure and the level of support required for our regulatory compliance and legal matters.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2015, we have excluded $495 million related to a settlement charge in connection with a private civil suit. in addition, for the year ended december 31, 2014, we have excluded $17 million, related to loss contingency accrual for the settlement of the 2010 and 2011 u.s. attorney physician relationship investigations. these are non-gaap measures and are not intended as substitutes for the equivalent gaap measures. we have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. as a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normal prior period results.

net revenues dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $496 million, or 5.7%, from 2015. the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by solid volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 4.5% due to an increase in acquired and non-acquired treatment growth at existing and new dialysis centers, as well as one additional treatment day in 2016 as compared to 2015. dialysis and related lab services' net revenues also benefited from an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $4, primarily due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix, offset by an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of $24 million.
dialysis and related lab services net revenues for 2015 increased by approximately $431 million, or 5.2%, from 2014. the increase in net revenues was primarily due to solid volume growth from additional treatments of approximately 4.0% due to an increase in non-acquired treatment growth at existing and new dialysis centers and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6. the increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment in 2015, as compared to 2014, was due to an increase in our average commercial payment rates and improvements in our commercial payor mix, offset by an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts of $53 million.

commercial (including hospital dialysis services)          36   %          34   %          33   %
total dialysis and related lab services revenues          100   %         100   %         100   %
approximately 64% of our total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 were from government-based programs, principally medicare, medicaid, medicare-assigned and medicaid-assigned plans, representing approximately 88% of our total patients. over the last two years, the growth of our commercial patients slightly outpaced the growth of our government-based patients as more of our patients are covered by commercial contracted plans. less than 1% of our dialysis and related lab services revenues are due directly from patients. there is no single commercial payor that accounted for more than 10% of total dialysis and related lab services revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016.
on average, dialysis-related payment rates from contracted commercial payors are significantly higher than medicare, medicaid and other government program payment rates, and therefore the percentage of commercial patients as a relationship to total patients represents a major driver of our total average dialysis revenue per treatment. for a patient covered by a commercial insurance plan, medicare generally becomes the primary payor after 33 months, which includes the three month waiting period, or earlier if the patient's commercial insurance plan coverage terminates. when medicare becomes the primary payor, the payment rates we receive for that patient shifts from the commercial insurance plan rates to medicare payment rates, which are significantly lower than commercial insurance rates. medicare payment rates are insufficient to cover our costs associated with providing dialysis services, and we therefore lose money on each medicare treatment that we provide.
nearly all of our net earnings from our dialysis and related lab services are derived from commercial payors, some of which pay at established contract rates and others of which pay negotiated payment rates based on our usual and customary fee schedule for our out-of-network patients, which are typically higher than commercial contracted rates. if we experience an overall net reduction in our contracted and non-contracted commercial payment rates as a result of negotiations, restrictions or changes to the healthcare regulatory system, including the potential impact of healthcare insurance exchanges, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
operating expenses and charges patient care costs. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and consist principally of labor, benefits, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and other operating costs of the dialysis centers. dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $226 and $221 for 2016 and 2015, respectively. the $5 increase in per treatment costs in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in labor and benefit costs due to a decrease in productivity, increased turnover and clinical labor rates, an increase in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers and an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees.
dialysis and related lab services patient care costs on a per treatment basis were $221 and $219 for 2015 and 2014, respectively. the $2 increase in per treatment costs in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to higher overall pharmaceutical costs due to higher pharmaceutical unit costs, an increase in other direct operating expenses associated with our dialysis centers, and a slight increase in labor costs, partially offset by improvements in productivity, and lower general and professional insurance costs.
general and administrative expenses. dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in 2016 increased by approximately $42 million as compared to 2015. the increase was primarily due to an increase in our labor and benefit costs, occupancy, and legal costs, partially offset by a decrease in long-term compensation costs.
dialysis and related lab services general and administrative expenses in 2015 increased by approximately $27 million as compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in our labor and benefit costs and long-term compensation costs.
depreciation and amortization. dialysis and related lab services depreciation and amortization expenses for 2016 increased by approximately $45 million as compared to 2015 and increased by $35 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. the increases were primarily due to both growth through new dialysis center developments and additional informational technology initiatives.
72
provision for uncollectible accounts receivable. the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable for our dialysis and related lab services business was 4.5% for 2016 and 2015, and 4.1% for 2014. the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was flat as a percent of revenue in 2016 and 2015. we currently expect the level of the provision for uncollectible accounts in 2017 to be consistent with 2016 although it may increase if we encounter collection issues.
equity investment income. equity investment income was approximately $18 million, $15 million and $14 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increases in equity investment income over the last three years were primarily due to the increase in the number of nonconsolidated dialysis joint ventures and an increase in profitability at some of these joint ventures.
accounts receivable. our u.s. dialysis and related lab services accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 were $1.358 billion and $1.255 billion, respectively, representing approximately 55 days and 53 days of revenue, respectively, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. the increase in day sales outstanding (dso) for our dialysis and related lab services business was primarily the result of improved cash collection performance in 2015 which we did not experience in 2016. our dso calculation is based on the current quarter's average revenues per day.
as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, our dialysis and related lab services unreserved accounts receivable balances that were more than six months old were approximately $216 million and $233 million, respectively, representing approximately 16% and 18% of our dialysis accounts receivable balances, respectively. there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above.
amounts pending approval from third-party payors associated with medicare bad debt claims as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, other than the standard monthly billing, consisted of approximately $105 million in 2016 and $106 million in 2015 and is classified as other receivables. currently, a significant portion of our medicare bad debt claims are typically paid to us before the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims. however, the payment received from medicare is subject to adjustment based upon the actual results of the audits. such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed.
segment operating income dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2016 increased by approximately $517 million as compared to 2015, which included a settlement charge of $495 million. excluding this item from 2015, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income would have increased by $22 million. this increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments, one additional treatment day, and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $4, as described above. adjusted operating income also increased due to a decrease in long-term compensation costs, partially offset by higher patient care costs and an increase general administrative expenses.
dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2015, which included a settlement charge of $495 million, decreased by approximately $378 million as compared to 2014, which included a loss contingency accrual of $17 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income for 2015 would have increased by $100 million. this increase in adjusted operating income for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to solid treatment growth as a result of additional dialysis treatments and an increase in the average dialysis revenue per treatment of approximately $6, as described above. adjusted operating income also increased due to improved productivity and lower general and professional insurance costs, partially offset by higher overall pharmaceutical costs, as described above, and an increase in our provision for uncollectible accounts of $53 million.
dmg business dmg is a patient- and physician-focused, integrated healthcare delivery and management company with over two decades of experience providing coordinated, outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner. as of december 31, 2016, dmg served approximately 749,300 members under its care in southern california, central and south florida, southern nevada and central new mexico through capitation contracts with some of the nation's leading health plans. of these 749,300 members, approximately 305,200 individuals were patients enrolled in medicare and medicare advantage, and the remaining approximately 444,100 individuals were managed care members whose health coverage is provided through their employer or who have individually acquired health coverage directly from a health plan or as a result of their eligibility for medicaid benefits. in addition to its managed care business, during the year ended december 31, 2016, dmg provided care across all markets to over 896,200 patients whose health coverage is structured on a ffs basis, including patients enrolled through traditional medicare and medicaid programs, preferred provider organizations and other third party payors.
dmg's patients as well as the patients of dmg's associated physicians, physician groups and ipas benefit from an integrated approach to medical care that places the physician at the center of patient care. as of december 31, 2016, dmg delivered services to
73
its members via a network of approximately 700 primary care physicians, over 2,500 associated groups and other network primary care physicians, approximately 200 network hospitals, and several thousand associated group and network specialists. together with hundreds of case managers, registered nurses and other care coordinators, these medical professionals utilize a comprehensive information technology system, sophisticated risk management techniques and clinical protocols to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to dmg's members. dmg's total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016, was approximately $4.114 billion, or approximately 28% of our consolidated net revenues.
key financial measures and indicators operating revenues dmg's consolidated revenues consist primarily of capitated revenues, including revenues attributable to capitated contracts with health plans, patient fee-for-service revenues and other operating revenues, each as described in more detail below.
capitation revenue derived from health plans typically results from either (i) premium payments by cms to dmg's health plan customers under medicare advantage with respect to seniors, disabled and other eligible persons (which are referred to herein as dmg's senior membership), (ii) premium payments by state governments to dmg's health plan customers under medicaid managed care programs (which are referred to herein as dmg's medicaid membership), and (iii) premium payments from public and private employers and individuals to dmg's health plan customers with respect to their employees (which are referred to herein as dmg's commercial membership). capitation payments under health plan contracts are made monthly based on the number of enrollees selecting a dmg associated group physician employed or associated with one of dmg's medical group entities as their primary healthcare provider. the amount of pmpm capitation payments that dmg receives monthly from health plans on behalf of a member generally does not vary during a given calendar year, regardless of the level of actual medical services utilized by the member. as described in more detail below, in central florida and southern nevada dmg principally utilizes a global capitation model in which it assumes the financial responsibility for both professional (physician) and institutional (hospital) services for covered benefits, whereas in new mexico, dmg assumes the financial responsibility for professional services only. in southern california, dmg utilizes variants of a different model for capitation under which it is directly financially responsible for covered professional services, but indirectly financially responsible for covered institutional expenses. see below for further discussion regarding changes to dmg's revenue recognition for hospital services. dmg's associated medical groups also receive specified incentive payments from health plans based on specified performance and quality criteria. these amounts are accrued when earned and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
•   global capitation model. dmg records the aggregate global capitation pmpm fee as revenue and the amounts paid with respect to claims as medical expenses or hospital expenses, as applicable. see "patient care costs-medical expenses" and "patient care costs-hospital expenses" below. revenue with respect to both professional and institutional capitation is recorded in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare. in dmg's central florida market, dmg also receives capitation revenue and is liable for corresponding expenses for prescription drug activity rendered on behalf of dmg's senior members through the part d component under the medicare advantage program.

•   risk-sharing model. as compensation under its various managed care-related administrative services agreements with hospitals, dmg is entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses, and any such risk-share amount to which dmg is entitled is recorded as medical revenues. in addition, pursuant to such managed care-related administrative services agreements, dmg agrees to be responsible should the third party incur institutional expenses in excess of institutional capitation revenue. as with global capitation, revenue with respect to professional capitation is reported in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare. however, risk-share revenues (that is, the portion of the excess or deficit of institutional capitation revenue to which dmg is entitled less institutional expenses), in contrast, are based on the number of enrollees and estimates of institutional utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees, and the amounts earned are accrued when they can be reasonably estimated. differences between actual contract settlements and estimated receivables and payables are recorded in the year of final settlement. in december 2013, dmg obtained a restricted knox-keene license in california, which permits dmg to enter into global capitation agreements with health plans that allow dmg to assume financial responsibility for both professional and institutional services. dmg has evaluated its various risk sharing arrangements, and is working with the department of managed health care and several health plans to accept global capitation. dmg has converted three separate contracts covering approximately 3% of total dhpc's membership to global risk and is in the approval and implementation process to convert additional contracts to global risk in 2017. completion of evaluation of possible additional conversions is expected to continue to occur over time.

74
•   retroactive revenue adjustments. the medicare advantage revenue received by dmg's health plan customers is adjusted periodically to give effect to the relative clinical and demographic profile of the members for whom dmg is financially responsible. the model employed by cms bases a portion of the total reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors, including hospital inpatient diagnoses, additional diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings, hospital outpatient department and physician visits, gender, age and medicaid eligibility. cms requires that all managed care companies capture, collect and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms twice a year for reconciliation with cms's internal database. capitation payments under this methodology are paid at interim rates during the year and retroactive adjustments occur in subsequent periods (generally in the third quarter of the same year, with a final adjustment in the third quarter of the following year) after the data is compiled by cms. dmg estimates the amount of the current year adjustments in revenues during the first and second quarters of any given year and adjusts its estimates during the third quarter, upon receipt of payments from cms. differences between actual contract settlements and estimated revenues are recorded in the year of final settlement. to date, all such adjustments have resulted in increases in revenue.

•   patient service revenues. patient service revenues are recorded when the services are provided to patients on a ffs basis. such revenues are based on a negotiated fixed-fee schedule with the applicable payor.

•   other operating revenues. in addition to the revenues discussed above, other operating revenues primarily consists of (i) hospital subsidy payments, (ii) management fees dmg receives as the manager of its unconsolidated joint ventures, (iii) revenues from the maintenance of existing physicians' networks, (iv) medical consulting revenues, and (v) revenues recognized under meaningful use programs established by federal and state governments which provide financial incentives for providers to implement and utilize electronic health record technology to improve patient care.

patient care costs dmg's largest patient care costs are the costs of medical services provided pursuant to its capitation contracts, which consist of medical expenses, hospital expenses and clinical support and other operating costs, as further described below. under both the global capitation and the risk-share capitation models, costs of medical services are recognized in the month in which the related services are provided. in addition, medical expenses and hospital expenses include an estimate of such expenses that have been incurred but not yet reported. for further information on how dmg estimates such claims, see "critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments-medical liability claims associated with dmg" below.
medical expenses. medical expenses consist of payments for professional and ancillary services to independent primary care physicians, specialists, ancillary providers and hospitals (including, with respect to hospitals, for outpatient services) pursuant to agreements with those entities. the structure of such expenses can consist of, among other things, sub-capitation and ffs payments. in addition, medical expenses include compensation and related expenses incurred with respect to dmg's associated group primary care physicians and specialists, registered nurses, physician assistants and hospitalists.
hospital expenses. hospital expenses consist of payments for institutional services to contracted and non-contracted hospitals for both inpatient and outpatient services, skilled nursing facilities, and to other institutional providers. hospital expenses are only incurred in connection with the services dmg provides in florida and nevada. in those regions, as described above, dmg enters into contracts with health plans pursuant to which it assumes the risk for institutional hospital services. in contrast in california, dmg's medical groups were not permitted to contract with health plans to directly assume the risk for institutional services. accordingly, the risk-share revenue that dmg records in california is net of reported claims and estimates of hospital utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees, and no portion of institutional hospital costs incurred with respect to dmg's california operations is included in hospital expenses as presented. however, as a result of dmg obtaining a restricted knox-keene license in december 2013 as discussed above, dmg now assumes some risk for institutional services in california.
clinic support and other operating costs. clinic support and other operating costs primarily consist of the costs incurred with respect to compensation of administrative and other support staff employed at dmg's medical clinics, clinic rent and utilities, medical supplies and other direct costs incurred to support clinic operations.
other operating expenses general and administrative. general and administrative expenses are those costs directly related to corporate administrative functions in supporting dmg and consist primarily of salaries and benefits, professional fees and occupancy costs.

capitated membership information the table set forth below provides (i) the total number of capitated members to whom dmg provided healthcare services as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, and (ii) the aggregate member months for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. member months represent the aggregate number of months of healthcare services dmg has provided to capitated members during a period of time.
in addition to the members above, dmg provided healthcare services to members in two of its operating unconsolidated joint ventures that are accounted for as equity investments. these joint ventures provided healthcare services for approximately 148,700, 130,700 and 45,700 members as of december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and for approximately 1,760,000, 1,564,200 and 538,000 member months for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in members and member months was primarily due to an increase in members related to tandigm.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, dmg members decreased by approximately 58,100 and member months decreased by approximately 617,000. the decrease in members and member months was due to planned non-renewals of certain commercial and medicaid contracts, a decrease in commercial members as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services for their employees, and the sale of our dmg arizona business which caused a decrease in senior members, partially offset by an increase in senior members from new acquisitions and non-acquired growth.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, dmg members decreased by approximately 29,900 and member months increased approximately 62,400. the decrease in members was due to a planned reduction in medicaid members and a decline in commercial members as employers shift to less expensive options for medical services for their employees, partially offset by an increase in senior members due to non-acquired growth. the increase in member months was primarily attributable to an increase in senior members resulting from non-acquired growth, new acquisitions and an increase in medicaid members due to medicaid expansion. this increase in member months was partially offset by a planned non-renewal of certain plans in certain markets due to unfavorable economics.

net revenues dmg's net revenues for 2016 increased $277 million, or 7.2%, primarily due to an increase in ffs revenues due to the acquisition of the everett clinic medical group (tec) in march 2016 and an increase in senior capitated revenues due to an increase in the number of senior capitated members during the year attributable to non-acquired growth and acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in medicare advantage and medicaid rates, as described below, a decrease in senior capitated revenues from the sale of our dmg arizona business, a decrease in medicaid revenues due to the timing of the recognition of additional medicaid risk sharing revenue in 2015, a decrease in other revenues due to the recognition of additional revenues related to the maintenance of existing physician networks in 2015, a decrease in other consulting revenues and a decrease in commercial and medicaid members to whom dmg provides health care services.
dmg's net revenue for 2015 increased $335 million, or 9.6%, primarily driven by an increase in ffs revenue from acquisitions, an increase in senior capitated revenue due to an increase in the number of senior capitated members during the year that is attributable to non-acquired growth and acquisitions, an increase in medicaid memberships due to medicaid expansion, recognition of additional medicaid risk-share revenue due to decreased costs related to lower claims, and higher commercial negotiated rates for commercial members. these increases in net revenues were partially offset by a decrease in senior capitated revenues due to the planned non-renewal of some plans due to unfavorable economics in certain markets.
on april 4, 2016, cms issued final guidance for 2017 medicare advantage benchmark payment rates (rate announcement). in 2017, cms will fully implement the 2017 risk adjustment model proposed in the rate announcement, but with updated coefficients. based upon our preliminary analysis of the final rule, we estimate that the reduction in 2017 rates, including adjustments for the new aca blended benchmark county rates and qualifying bonuses, will lead to a reduction in medicare advantage rates to dmg of approximately 1.0%, or a net decrease of approximately $25 million to our 2017 operating income. this compares, according to cms, to an industry average rate increase of approximately 0.85% without accounting for the expected growth in coding acuity that has typically added another 2.2%. the final impact of 2017 medicare advantage rates may vary from this estimate and will be impacted by the relative growth of dmg's medicare advantage patient volumes across markets as well as by the benefit plan designs submitted. it is possible that we have underestimated the impact of the 2017 medicare advantage rates on our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows. the more significant decreases in medicare advantage rates for the company compared to the industry average are largely driven by two factors: dmg's higher mix of medicare advantage patients in counties that will receive a lower-than-average benchmark rate increase, and a higher-than-average impact from a revision to the risk model to differentiate payment levels between dual-eligible and non-dual-eligible patients.
the 2016 medicare advantage rates incorporated a modification to the risk adjustment model calculation that cms utilizes to determine the risk acuity scores of medicare advantage patients. these changes to the rate structure and risk model calculation decreased dmg's 2016 medicare advantage rates by approximately 2.0% of the medicare advantage revenues dmg manages on behalf of its senior capitated population as compared to 2015. this compares, according to cms, to the industry average rate increase of approximately 1.25%.
the more significant decline in medicare advantage rates for dmg compared to the industry average is driven by a larger-than-average decline associated with cms's modification to the risk adjustment model calculations. we believe the full implementation of the 2014 cms-hcc risk adjustment model negatively affects dmg and other providers like us who have invested more heavily in wellness and prevention programs for patients with chronic conditions.
patient care costs the following table reflects dmg's patient care costs which are comprised of medical expenses, hospital expenses, clinic support and other operating costs:
year ended december 31,

2016                 2015                  2014

operating expenses patient care costs. dmg's patient care costs for 2016 increased by approximately $285 million from 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of tec, an increase in medical claim expenses, hospital expenses, and clinic support costs due
78
to increased senior capitated members from acquisitions and non-acquired growth, and increased headcount. the increase in costs was partially offset by a decrease due to the sale of our arizona business, decreased consulting expenses, a decrease in benefits, and a decrease in commercial and medicaid members to whom dmg provides healthcare services.
dmg's patient care costs for 2015 increased by approximately $210 million from 2014. the increase was primarily attributable to increases in medical claim expenses and hospital expenses due to increases in senior and medicaid member months from acquisitions, non-acquired growth, medicaid expansion, market expansion and the timing of the recognition of additional benefit expense related to higher medicaid risk sharing revenues. the increase was also driven by an increase in clinic support costs due to acquisitions. the increase in costs was partially offset by a decrease in commercial members to whom dmg provides healthcare services and a decrease in costs due to the planned non-renewal of some plans due to unfavorable economics in certain markets.
general and administrative expenses. dmg's general and administrative costs for 2016, which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our dmg nevada hospice business of $16 million, increased $68 million from 2015. excluding this item, adjusted general and administrative expenses would have increased by $52 million. this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of tec, an increase in corporate administrative support expenses due to increased labor costs and costs associated with growth initiatives, partially offset by a decrease due to the sale of our dmg arizona business and a decrease in benefits.
dmg's general and administrative costs for 2015 increased $90 million from 2014. this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in corporate administrative support costs related to growth initiatives, professional fees, recognition of additional compensation expense, and travel costs.
depreciation and amortization. dmg's depreciation and amortization for 2016 increased $37 million from 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of tec, an increase in amortization related to the acceleration of the hcp-related trade names, and an increase in technology and property investments as part of our growth initiatives. as of september 1, 2016, we committed to a plan to change hcp trade names to dmg. as a result of this decision we began to accelerate the amortization of the remaining carrying value of hcp trade names, which resulted in additional amortization of $9 million for 2016. this additional amortization will continue at a rate of approximately $7 million per quarter through the first quarter of 2019 which represents the remaining life of these assets.
dmg's depreciation and amortization for 2015 increased $4 million from 2014. the increase is primarily attributable to depreciation and amortization of assets associated with acquisitions.
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $189 million on goodwill and $17 million on other intangible assets of certain dmg reporting units based on assessments performed after circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill of certain dmg reporting units had become impaired. these circumstances included underperformance of the business in recent quarters, as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate them.
based on continuing developments at our dmg reporting units during 2016, including the medicare advantage final benchmark rates for 2017 announced on april 4, 2016, further changes in our expectations concerning future government reimbursement rates and our expected ability to mitigate them, as well as medical cost and utilization trends, underperformance of certain at-risk units in recent quarters and other market conditions, we performed additional goodwill impairment assessments for certain at-risk dmg reporting units during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and as of their november 1 annual assessment date.
as a result of the assessments described above, we have recognized the dmg goodwill impairment charges shown below:

gain on sales of business interests. effective june 30, 2016, we sold a portion of our ownership interest in tandigm, reducing our ownership from 50% to 19% and resulting in a pre-tax gain of $40 million. in addition, on june 1, 2016, we sold our dmg arizona business for a pre-tax loss of $10 million.
79
equity investment loss (income). dmg's share of equity investment income from our nonconsolidated joint ventures for 2016 decreased $8 million from 2015. this increase in equity losses was primarily attributable to a decrease in profitability of certain joint ventures, partially offset by the sale of a portion of our tandigm ownership interest during second quarter which resulted in a reduced share of equity investment losses during the third and fourth quarters of 2016.
dmg's share of equity investment income from our nonconsolidated joint venture relationships for 2015 decreased $6 million from 2014. this decrease in equity income was primarily attributable to our share of expenses from a certain newly formed joint venture that provides integrated healthcare and reduced commercial risk pool performance.
segment operating income dmg's operating income for 2016, which includes the goodwill impairment charges of $253 million, the gain related to the sale of a portion of our tandigm ownership interest of $40 million, the loss on the sale of our dmg arizona business of $10 million and an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our dmg nevada hospice business of $16 million, decreased $138 million from 2015, which included estimated goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $206 million related to certain reporting units. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted operating income for the year ended december 31, 2016 would have decreased by approximately $105 million. this decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in medicare advantage and medicaid rates, a decrease in revenue due to the timing of medicaid risk sharing revenue and additional revenues related to the maintenance of existing physicians networks recognized in 2015, the acquisition of tec, an increase in depreciation and amortization related to the trade names acceleration, and an increase in technology and property investments and corporate administrative support costs, partially offset by a decrease in benefits and an increase in senior capitated members due to acquisitions and non-acquired growth.
dmg's operating income for 2015, which included estimated goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of $206 million related to certain reporting units decreased $181 million from 2014. excluding this item from 2015, adjusted operating income for the year ended december 31, 2015 would have increased by approximately $25 million, or 11.6%. this increase in adjusted operating income was primarily attributable to an increase in ffs revenue from acquisitions and non-acquired growth, an increase in medicaid members due to medicaid expansion, the timing of recognition of additional medicare risk share revenue and a reduction of claims expense due to the planned non-renewal of some plans due to unfavorable economics in certain markets. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in commercial members, and higher general and administrative costs.
other-ancillary services and strategic initiatives business our other operations include ancillary services and strategic initiatives which are primarily aligned with our core business of providing dialysis services to our network of patients. as of december 31, 2016, these consisted primarily of pharmacy services, disease management services, vascular access services, clinical research programs, physician services, direct primary care and our international dialysis operations. the ancillary services and strategic initiatives generated approximately $1.621 billion of net revenues in 2016, representing approximately 10% of our consolidated net revenues. we currently expect to continue to invest in our ancillary services and strategic initiatives, including our continued expansion into certain international markets, as we work to develop successful new business operations. however, any significant change in market conditions, business performance or in the regulatory environment may impact the economic viability of any of these strategic initiatives. any unfavorable changes in these strategic initiatives could result in a write-off or an impairment of some or all of our investments, including goodwill, and could also result in significant termination costs if we were to exit a certain line of business or one or more of our international markets.
as of december 31, 2016, we provided dialysis and administrative services to a total of 154 outpatient dialysis centers located in 11 countries outside of the u.s. our international dialysis operations are still in an early phase of development as we primarily commenced operations during the fourth quarter of 2011. the total net revenues generated from our international operations, as reflected below, were approximately 1% of our 2016 consolidated net revenues.

(1)   for the year ended december 31, 2016, we have excluded a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an estimated accrual of $16 million for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business, an impairment of $15 million related to a minority equity investment, and a gain on the apac jv ownership changes of $374 million. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we have excluded estimated goodwill impairment charges of $4 million and an estimated accrual of $22 million for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business. these are non-gaap measures and are not intended as substitutes for the equivalent gaap measures. we have presented these adjusted amounts because management believes that these presentations enhance a user's understanding of our normal consolidated operating income by excluding certain items which we do not believe are indicative of our ordinary results of operations. as a result, adjusting for these amounts allows for comparison to our normal prior period results.

net revenues ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2016 increased by approximately $239 million, or 17.3%, as compared to 2015. the increase was primarily related to an increase in pharmaceutical rates, a decrease in reserves due to refunds of pharmacy reimbursements taken in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016, an increase in villagehealth special needs plan revenues and an increase in net revenues from our expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our pharmacy services volume.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives net revenues for 2015 increased by approximately $243 million, or 21.3%, as compared to 2014. the increase was primarily related to an increase in pharmacy services volume and pharmaceutical rates, as well as an increase in net revenues from growth in our international business and other strategic initiatives. these increases were partially offset by an increase in reserves for refunds of prior period pharmacy reimbursements.
81
operating and general expenses ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2016, which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business of $16 million, increased by approximately $203 million from 2015, which included an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business of $22 million. excluding these items from their respective periods, ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses would have increased by $209 million. this increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs, labor and benefit costs, professional fees, other general and administration expenses, and additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion, partially offset by a decrease in prescription dispensing volume and long-term incentive compensation expense.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating expenses for 2015, which included an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business of $22 million, increased by approximately $318 million from 2014. excluding this item from 2015, the ancillary services and strategic initiatives adjusted operating expenses would have increased by $296 million. this increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in prescription dispensing volume, higher pharmaceutical costs, higher labor costs and related payroll taxes and benefit costs, additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion, and an increase in costs associated with the right to use intellectual property and general and administrative and corporate administrative support expenses.
goodwill and other asset impairment charges. during the quarter ended december 31, 2016, we determined that circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill of our vascular access reporting unit had become impaired. these circumstances included changes in governmental reimbursement and our expected ability to mitigate them. specifically, on november 2, 2016, cms released the 2017 physician fee schedule final rule and the ambulatory surgical center payment final rule which reflected significant changes in reimbursement structure for this business unit. we have performed the required valuations to estimate the fair value of the net assets and implied goodwill of this reporting unit with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm. based on this assessment, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million.
in 2016, we also recorded an impairment of $15 million related to a minority equity investment in one of our international reporting units.
in 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million in one of our international reporting units.
gain on changes in ownership interests in asia pacific joint venture (apac jv)
on august 1, 2016, we consummated an agreement with khazanah nasional berhad (khazanah) and mitsui and co., ltd (mitsui) whereby khazanah and mitsui subscribed to invest a total of $300 million over three years in exchange for a 40% total equity interest in our apac jv. khazanah and mitsui each made related initial investments of $50 million in this business on august 1, 2016.
as a result of this transaction, we deconsolidated our asia pacific dialysis business in the third quarter and recognized a non-cash non-taxable gain of $374 million on our retained investment in the apac jv net of contingent obligations as a result of adjusting the carrying value of our retained interest in the apac jv to our proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the business.
segment operating income (loss)
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating income for 2016, which includes a gain on the apac jv ownership changes of $374 million, a goodwill impairment charge of $28 million related to our vascular access reporting unit, an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities associated with our pharmacy business of $16 million and an impairment of $15 million related to a minority equity investment, increased by approximately $371 million from 2015, which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities of $22 million, as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million related to our international operations. excluding these items from their respective periods, adjusted operating losses would have decreased by $30 million. this decrease in adjusted operating losses was primarily due to an increase in pharmaceutical rates, a decrease in reserves due to refunds of pharmacy reimbursements taken in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016, an increase in villagehealth special needs plan revenues and an increase in net revenues from our expansion in our international business and other strategic initiatives. the decrease in adjusted operating losses was partially offset by an increase in pharmaceutical unit costs, higher labor and benefits costs and additional expenses associated with our international dialysis expansion.
ancillary services and strategic initiatives operating losses for 2015 increased by approximately $79 million from 2014 which includes an estimated accrual for damages and liabilities of $22 million, as well as a goodwill impairment charge of $4 million related to our international operations during the second quarter of 2015. excluding these items from 2015, adjusted operating losses would have increased by $53 million. this increase in adjusted operating losses was primarily due to an increase in drug prescription costs associated with our pharmacy business, higher labor costs, increases in expenses related to our international expansion, an increase in
82
costs associated with the right to use intellectual property and an increase in general and administrative costs. the increase in adjusted operating losses was partially offset by an increase in net revenue in our pharmacy business, primarily from additional volume and increases in pharmaceutical rates.
corporate level charges debt expense. debt expense for 2016, 2015, and 2014 consisted of interest expense of approximately $394 million, $390 million, and $386 million, respectively, and amortization and accretion of debt discounts and premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of interest rate cap agreements of approximately $20 million in 2016, $18 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2014. the increase in debt expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily related to an increase in our weighted average outstanding principal balances as a result of a full year of interest on our 5.0% senior notes, which were issued in april 2015, and an increase in our interest rate on the amortization of our cap agreements in the fourth quarter of 2016. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2016 was 4.43% as compared to 4.42% in 2015.
the increase in debt expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to an increase in weighted average outstanding principal balances offset by lower weighted average interest rates as a result of the issuance of our 5.0% senior notes in april 2015, as well as the entry into a new credit agreement and the issuance of senior notes in june 2014. our overall weighted average effective interest rate in 2015 was 4.42% as compared to 4.68% in 2014.
corporate administrative support. corporate administrative support consists primarily of labor, benefits and long-term incentive compensation costs, as well as professional fees for departments which provide support to all of our various operating lines of business. in 2016, it also included an adjustment to reduce receivables associated with the dmg acquisition escrow provision relating to income tax items of $31 million, as discussed below. these expenses are included in our consolidated general and administrative expenses.
in connection with the acquisition of dmg, we recorded receivables against the acquisition escrow balance to offset specific potential tax liabilities. certain of these potential tax liabilities expired, resulting in the reduction of these assets during 2016. this negatively impacted our corporate administrative support cost by $31 million. this cost was directly offset by a corresponding reduction in income tax expense due to the expiration of the corresponding tax liabilities.
corporate administrative support costs were approximately $45 million in 2016, which included the adjustment to reduce receivables associated with the dmg acquisition escrow provision relating to an income tax item of $31 million, as compared to $19 million in 2015. this increase of approximately $26 million in corporate administrative support costs is primarily attributable to the tax receivables related to the dmg acquisition escrow provision, as well as increases in labor and benefits, professional fees, and other general and administrative expenses. these increases were offset by a decrease in long-term incentive compensation, primarily due to reductions in ultimate expected pay-outs as well as the departure of a senior executive.
corporate administrative support costs were approximately $19 million in 2015, as compared to $13 million in 2014. the change of approximately $6 million in corporate administrative support costs was primarily attributable to an increase in labor and benefits and professional fees, offset by an increase in management fee allocations.
other income. other income was approximately $9 million in both 2016 and 2015, and $2 million in 2014, and consisted principally of interest income. other income in 2016 as compared to 2015 was flat, as short-term investment interest income increased but was offset by an increase in foreign currency transaction losses. other income increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to an increase in short-term investment interest income and a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses.
provision for income taxes. the provision for income taxes for 2016, 2015 and 2014 represented an effective annualized tax rate of 30.6%, 40.9% and 34.1% of income from continuing operations, respectively. the effective tax rate in 2016 was lower primarily due to the gain on the apac jv ownership changes, offset by goodwill impairment charges.
noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $153 million, $158 million and $140 million, respectively. the decrease in noncontrolling interests in 2016 was primarily due to the impairment of our vascular access reporting unit, which resulted in a decrease in noncontrolling interest of $8 million. the increase in noncontrolling interests expense in 2015 was primarily due to increases in the profitability of our dialysis-related joint ventures. the percentage of u.s. dialysis and related lab services net revenues generated from dialysis-related joint ventures was approximately 24%, 23% and 22% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
83
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances at december 31, 2016 and december 31, 2015 were $1.917 billion and $1.724 billion, respectively, representing approximately 49 days and 46 days of revenue, respectively, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. the increase in dso was primarily related to our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business, mainly as a result of improved cash collection performance in 2015 which we did not experience in 2016. our dso calculation is based on the current quarter's average revenues per day.
as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, our unreserved patient services accounts receivable balances more than six months old were approximately $252 million and $246 million, respectively, representing approximately 16% and 18% of our net patient and other services accounts receivable balances, respectively. there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old. less than 1% of our revenues are classified as patient pay. substantially all revenue realized is from government and commercial payors, as discussed above.
for receivables associated with our capitated health plans, the balances remain on the balance sheet for as long as the respective plan years are open, which varies by health plan, but is generally two years in length. the majority of our capitated health plans accounts receivable is three to six months old with collections occurring on a periodic basis throughout the duration of the corresponding plan year.
liquidity and capital resources available liquidity. as of december 31, 2016, our cash balance was $913 million and we also had approximately $310 million in short-term investments. we also had an undrawn revolving line of credit under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $1.0 billion, of which approximately $95.2 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. the remaining amount is unencumbered. in addition, dmg has an outstanding letter of credit of approximately $1.3 million that is secured by a certificate of deposit. we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity, operating cash flows and access to borrowings to fund our scheduled debt service payments and other obligations for the foreseeable future. our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings.
cash flow from operations during 2016 amounted to $2.0 billion compared with $1.6 billion for 2015. the increase in our operating cash flows in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to payments of $494 million, or $304 million after-tax, made in connection with the settlement of a private civil suit in 2015 and due to the timing of other working capital items, offset by an increase in our income tax payments and a slight increase in our cash interest payments. cash flow from operations in 2016 included cash interest payments of approximately $407 million and cash tax payments of $339 million. cash flow from operations in 2015 included cash interest payments of approximately $405 million and cash tax payments of $156 million.
non-operating cash outflows in 2016 included $829 million for capital asset expenditures, including $470 million for new center developments and relocations, and $359 million for maintenance and information technology. we also spent an additional $564 million for acquisitions. during 2016, we also received $1.3 billion from the maturity and sale of investments. however, these proceeds were principally used to repurchase other investments or to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. in addition, during 2016 we received $37 million associated with stock award exercises and other share issuances and related excess tax benefits. we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $192 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $48 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. we also repurchased a total of 16,649,090 shares of our common stock for $1.072 billion, or an average price of $64.41 per share. in addition, we settled $25 million in share repurchases related to 2015.
non-operating cash outflows in 2015 included $708 million for capital asset expenditures, including $381 million for new center developments and relocations and $327 million for maintenance and information technology. we also spent an additional $97 million for acquisitions. during 2015, we also received $1.6 billion from the maturity and sale of investments. however, these proceeds were principally used to repurchase other investments or to fund distributions from our deferred compensation plans. in addition, during 2015, we received $54 million associated with stock award exercises and other share issuances and the related excess tax benefits. we also made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $175 million, and received contributions from noncontrolling interests of $55 million associated with new joint ventures and from additional equity contributions. we also repurchased a total of 7,779,958 shares of our common stock for $575 million, or an average price of $73.96 per share, of which $25 million was unsettled at december 31, 2015.
on august 9, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our agreement to acquire colorado-based renal ventures limited, llc (renal ventures). as a result of the amended agreement, we will acquire a 100% interest in all 38 outpatient dialysis centers owned by renal ventures, including one new center under construction, and a 51% interest in one vascular access clinic. the purchase price will be approximately $360 million in cash subject to, among other things, adjustments for certain items such as working capital. the transaction is subject to approval by the federal trade commission (ftc) including hart-scott-rodino antitrust clearance. we
84
anticipate that we will be required by the ftc to divest some outpatient dialysis centers as a condition of the transaction. we currently expect the transaction to close in mid 2017.
during 2016, we opened 100 new u.s. dialysis centers, acquired a total of eight u.s. dialysis centers, merged five centers, added two centers which we operate under a management and administrative services agreement, terminated two management and administration services agreements, deconsolidated three centers which we now operate under management and administrative services agreements and closed four centers. outside the u.s., we acquired 21 dialysis centers and opened 15 new dialysis and hospital operated centers.
during 2016, our dmg business acquired three primary care physician practices including the acquisition of tec, and four private medical practices.
during 2015, we opened 72 new u.s. dialysis centers, acquired a total of six u.s. dialysis centers, sold one center, merged five centers, added two centers in which we operate under a management and administrative services agreement and closed two centers. outside the u.s., we acquired 21 dialysis centers, opened seven new dialysis and hospital operated centers, and terminated one management and administration services agreement.
during 2015, our dmg business acquired three family practices, one management services organization, two primary care practices, and six private medical practices.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $63 million on term loan a and $35 million on term loan b. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we made mandatory principal payments under our senior secured credit facilities totaling $50 million on term loan a and $35 million on term loan b.
interest rate swap and cap agreements as of december 31, 2016, we maintain several interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in november 2014 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. these previously forward cap agreements became effective september 30, 2016 and have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of our debt. these cap agreements expire on june 30, 2018. as of december 31, 2016, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of approximately $0.1 million. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a loss of $1.2 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these cap agreements.
as of december 31, 2016, we maintain several forward interest rate cap agreements that were entered into in october 2015 with notional amounts totaling $3.5 billion. these forward cap agreements will become effective june 29, 2018 and will have the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 3.50% on an equivalent amount of our debt. these cap agreements expire on june 30, 2020. as of december 31, 2016, the total fair value of these cap agreements was an asset of approximately $9.8 million. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a loss of $4.0 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these forward cap agreements.
previously, we maintained several interest rate cap agreements with notional amounts totaling $2.7 billion on our term loan b debt. these agreements had the economic effect of capping the libor variable component of our interest rate at a maximum of 2.50% on an equivalent amount of our term loan b. these interest rate cap agreements expired september 30, 2016. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized debt expense of $1.8 million from these caps.
we also previously maintained several interest rate swap agreements. these agreements had the economic effect of modifying the libor variable component of our interest rate on an equivalent amount of our term loan a to fixed rates ranging from 0.49% to 0.52%. these interest rate swap agreements required monthly interest payments and expired september 30, 2016. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized debt expense of $0.3 million from these swaps and recorded a loss of $0.8 million in other comprehensive income due to a decrease in the unrealized fair value of these swap agreements.
other items as of december 31, 2016, the interest rate on our term loan b debt bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of 2.75%. term loan b is subject to interest rate caps, if libor should rise above 3.50%. term loan a bears interest at libor plus an interest rate margin of 1.75%. the capped portion of term loan a is $87.5 million. in addition, the uncapped portion of term loan a, which is subject to the variability of libor, is $775 million. interest rates on our senior notes are fixed by their terms.
our overall weighted average effective interest rate on the senior secured credit facilities was 3.68%, based on the current margins in effect of 1.75% for term loan a and 2.75% for term loan b, as of december 31, 2016.
85
as of december 31, 2016, our interest rates are fixed on approximately 53% of our total debt.
our overall weighted average effective interest rate during the year ended december 31, 2016 was 4.43% and as of december 31, 2016 was 4.52%.
as of december 31, 2016, we had undrawn revolving credit facilities totaling $1.0 billion of which approximately $95.2 million was committed for outstanding letters of credit. in addition, we have approximately $1.3 million of committed letters of credit outstanding related to dmg which are backed by a certificate of deposit.
we believe that we will generate significant operating cash flows and will have sufficient liquidity to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations for the foreseeable future, including the next 12 months, under the terms of our debt agreements. our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and cash from borrowings.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the year ended december 31, 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $189 million on goodwill and $17 million on other intangible assets of certain dmg reporting units based on assessments performed after circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill of certain dmg reporting units had become impaired. these circumstances included underperformance of the businesses in recent quarters, as well as changes in other market conditions, including government reimbursement cuts and our expected ability to mitigate them.
based on continuing developments at our dmg reporting units during 2016, including the medicare advantage final benchmark rates for 2017 announced on april 4, 2016, further changes in our expectations concerning future government reimbursement rates and our expected ability to mitigate them, as well as medical cost and utilization trends, underperformance of certain at-risk units in recent quarters and other market conditions, we performed additional goodwill impairment assessments for certain at-risk dmg reporting units during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and as of their november 1 annual assessment date.
in addition, during the quarter ended december 31, 2016, we determined that circumstances indicated it had become more likely than not that the goodwill of our vascular access reporting unit had become impaired. these circumstances included changes in future governmental reimbursement and our expected ability to mitigate them. specifically, on november 2, 2016, cms released the 2017 physician fee schedule final rule and the ambulatory surgical center payment final rule which reflected significant changes in reimbursement structure for this business unit. accordingly, we performed the required valuations to estimate the fair value of the net assets and implied goodwill of this reporting unit with the assistance of a third-party valuation firm.
as a result of the assessments described above, we have recognized the goodwill impairment charges below:

there were no major changes in the business, prospects, or expected future results of these reporting units from their latest assessment date.
except as described above, none of our various other reporting units was considered at risk of goodwill impairment as of december 31, 2016. since the dates of our last annual goodwill impairment tests, there have been certain developments, events, changes in operating performance and other changes in key circumstances that have affected our businesses. however, except as further described above, these did not cause management to believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our other reporting units would be less than their respective carrying amount.
long-term incentive compensation long-term incentive program (ltip) compensation includes both stock-based awards (principally stock-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance stock units) as well as long-term performance-based cash awards. long-term incentive compensation expense, which was primarily general and administrative in nature, was attributed among our u.s. dialysis and related lab services business, dmg business, corporate administrative support, and the ancillary services and strategic initiatives.
our stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash. the value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures.
during 2016, we granted approximately 1,280,034 stock-settled stock appreciation rights (ssars) with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $17.6 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 4.2 years and approximately 328,457 stock units with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $23.6 million and a weighted-average expected life of approximately 3.3 years. we also granted 9,600 cash-settled stock-based awards with an aggregate grant-date fair value of $0.2 million.
long-term incentive compensation costs of $73.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $57.3 million as compared to 2015. this decrease in long-term incentive compensation was primarily due to a cumulative revaluation of liability-based awards for reductions in estimated ultimate payouts, as well as the final vesting of a prior broad grant that is no longer contributing expense.
long-term incentive compensation costs of $130.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 increased by approximately $11.7 million as compared to 2014. this increase in long-term incentive compensation was primarily due to an increase in the value of ltip awards that contributed expense during this period and ltip award forfeitures realized at a lower rate than previously expected.
as of december 31, 2016, there was $93.0 million in total estimated but unrecognized long-term incentive compensation costs for ltip awards outstanding, including $59.0 million relating to stock-based awards under our equity compensation plans. we expect to recognize the performance-based cash component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.0 year and the stock-based component of these ltip costs over a weighted average remaining period of 1.4 years.
87
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we received $28.4 million, $45.7 million and $59.1 million, respectively, in actual tax benefits upon the exercise of stock awards. since the company issues stock-settled stock appreciation rights rather than stock options, it did not receive cash proceeds from stock option exercises during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
stock repurchases in 2016, we repurchased a total of 16,649,090 shares of our common stock for $1.072 billion, or an average price of $64.41 per share. in 2015, we repurchased 7,779,958 shares of our common stock for $575 million, or an average price of $73.96 per share. in 2014, we did not repurchase any of our common stock. we have not repurchased any additional shares of our common stock from january 1, 2017 through february 24, 2017.
on july 13, 2016, our board of directors approved a share repurchase authorization in the amount of approximately $1.241 billion. this share repurchase authorization is in addition to the $259 million remaining at that time under our board of directors' prior share repurchase authorization announced in april 2015. as a result of the above transactions, there was approximately $677 million available under our current board authorizations for additional share repurchases as of february 24, 2017. although our share repurchase authorizations have no expiration dates, we are subject to share repurchase limitations under the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes.
off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet, we have commitments associated with operating leases and letters of credit, as well as potential obligations associated with our equity investments in nonconsolidated businesses and to dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties. substantially all of our u.s. dialysis facilities are leased. we have potential obligations to purchase the noncontrolling interests held by third parties in several of our majority-owned joint ventures and other nonconsolidated entities. these obligations are in the form of put provisions and are exercisable at the third-party owners' discretion within specified periods as outlined in each specific put provision. if these put provisions were exercised, we would be required to purchase the third-party owners' equity interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interests put to us, which is intended to approximate fair value. the methodology we use to estimate the fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions assumes the higher of either a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings, based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can affect future results, as well as other factors. the estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions is a critical accounting estimate that involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. the estimated fair values of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary significantly depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers' access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third-party owners' equity interests. the amount of noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions that employ a contractually predetermined multiple of earnings rather than fair value are immaterial. for additional information see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
we also have certain other potential commitments to provide operating capital to several dialysis centers that are wholly-owned by third parties or centers in which we own a noncontrolling equity interest as well as to physician-owned vascular access clinics or medical practices that we operate under management and administrative services agreements. we have certain other potential commitments related to service agreements of approximately $1.5 million.

we are committed to purchase a certain amount of our hemodialysis non-equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, from baxter at fixed prices through 2018. our total expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2016 on such products were approximately 2% of our total u.s. dialysis and related lab services operating expenses.
in 2010, we entered into and subsequently extended an agreement with fmc to purchase a certain amount of dialysis equipment, parts and supplies from fmc through december 31, 2017. our total expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2016 on such products were approximately 2% of our total u.s. dialysis and related lab services operating expenses. the actual amount of purchases in future years from fmc will depend upon a number of factors, including the operating requirements of our centers, the number of centers we acquire, and growth of our existing centers.
in 2014, we entered in to an agreement with baxter healthcare corporation (baxter) that commits us to purchase a certain amount of hemodialysis non-equipment product supplies, such as dialyzers, at fixed prices through 2018. our total expenditures for the year ended december 31, 2016 on such products were approximately 2% of our total u.s. dialysis and related lab service operating expenses.
in january 2017, we entered into a six year sourcing and supply agreement with amgen that expires on december 31, 2022, replacing our prior agreement that was to expire in 2018. under the terms of the agreement we will purchase epo in amounts necessary to meet no less than 90% of our requirements for esas from amgen. the actual amount of epo that we will purchase will depend upon the amount of epo administered during dialysis as prescribed by physicians and the overall number of patients that we serve.
settlements of approximately $28 million of existing income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, penalties and other long-term tax liabilities, are excluded from the above table as reasonably reliable estimates of their timing cannot be made.
supplemental information concerning certain physician groups and unrestricted subsidiaries the following information is presented as supplemental data as required by the indentures governing our senior notes.
we provide services to certain physician groups that, while consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes, are not subsidiaries of or owned by us, do not constitute "subsidiaries" as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and do not guarantee those senior notes. in addition, we have entered into management agreements with these physician groups pursuant to which we receive management fees from the physician groups.
89
as of december 31, 2016, if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements, our consolidated indebtedness would have been approximately $9.192 billion, our consolidated other liabilities (excluding indebtedness) would have been approximately $3.459 billion and our consolidated assets would have been approximately $18.313 billion. if these physician groups were not consolidated in our financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2016, our consolidated total net revenues (including approximately $737 million of management fees payable to us), consolidated operating income and consolidated net income would be reduced by approximately $1.350 billion, $53 million, and $32 million, respectively.
in addition, we own a 67% equity interest in california medical group insurance (cmgi), which is an unrestricted subsidiary as defined in the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, and does not guarantee those senior notes. our equity interest in cmgi is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, meaning that, although cmgi is not consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes, our consolidated income statement reflects our pro rata share of cmgi's net income as equity investment income.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, excluding our equity investment income attributable to cmgi, our consolidated operating income and consolidated net income would be increased by approximately $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
contingencies the information in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements of this report is incorporated by reference in response to this item.
critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles. these accounting principles require us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, contingencies and temporary equity. all significant estimates, judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary. actual results will generally differ from these estimates. changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods. certain accounting estimates, including those concerning revenue recognition and accounts receivable, impairments of goodwill or other long-lived assets, accounting for income taxes, quarterly and annual variable compensation accruals, consolidation of variable interest entities, purchase accounting valuation estimates, fair value estimates, stock-based compensation and medical liability claims are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates.
dialysis and related lab services revenue recognition and accounts receivable. there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of dialysis and related lab services revenue that we recognize in a given reporting period. payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments. in addition, ongoing insurance coverage changes, geographic coverage differences, differing interpretations of contract coverage, and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process. net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will ultimately be realized considering, among other items, retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews, audits, billing reviews and other matters.
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on (a) the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor (e.g., 80% for medicare patients) and (b) for the portion not paid by the primary government payor, the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage (e.g., medicaid secondary coverage), the patient's commercial health plan secondary coverage, or the patient. our dialysis related reimbursements from medicare are subject to certain variations under medicare's new single bundled payment rate system whereby our reimbursements can be adjusted for certain patient characteristics and certain other factors. our revenue recognition depends upon our ability to effectively capture, document and bill for medicare's base payment rate and these other factors. in addition, as a result of the potential range of variations that can occur in our dialysis-related reimbursements from medicare under the new single bundled payment rate system, our revenue recognition is now subject to a greater degree of estimating risk.
commercial healthcare plans, including contracted managed-care payors, are billed at our usual and customary rates; however, revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided. net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients covered under commercial healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements, non-contracted commercial healthcare plan coverage terms if known, estimated secondary collections, historical collection experience,
90
historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments (retractions), inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments, a slowdown in collections, a reduction in the amounts that we expect to collect and regulatory compliance issues. determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our approximately 187,700 u.s. patients at any point in time, together with the changes in patient coverage's that occur each month, requires complex, resource-intensive processes. collections, refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years or longer after services are provided.
we generally expect our range of dialysis and related lab services revenues estimating risk to be within 1% of its revenue, which can represent as much as 5% of dialysis and related lab services' adjusted operating income. changes in estimates are reflected in the then-current financial statements based on on-going actual experience trends, or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies. changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses, and have not been significant.
lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received.
dmg revenue recognition. dmg revenues consist primarily of fees for medical services provided under capitated contracts with various health plans and under risk-sharing programs. revenues with respect to both professional and institutional capitation are recognized in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare and are based on the number of enrollees selecting a dmg associated group physician employed or affiliated with one of dmg's medical group entities as their primary healthcare provider. capitation payments received for enrollees under medicare advantage plans are subject to retroactive adjustment depending upon certain clinical and demographic factors. we estimate the amount of current year adjustments in revenues during the first and second quarters of any given year and adjust our estimates during the third quarter upon receipt of payments from cms related to prior year. any difference between actual contract settlements and estimated revenues are recorded in the year of final settlement.
in addition, as compensation under dmg's various managed care-related agreements with hospitals, we are entitled to receive a percentage of the amount by which the institutional capitation revenue received from health plans exceeds institutional expenses, and any such risk-share amount to which we are entitled is recorded as dmg revenues. in addition, pursuant to such managed care-related agreements, dmg agrees to be responsible should the third party incur a deficit as a result of institutional expenses being in excess of institutional capitation revenue. as with global capitation, revenue with respect to professional capitation is reported in the month in which enrollees are entitled to receive healthcare. however, risk-share revenues (that is, the portion of the excess of institutional capitation revenue to which dmg is entitled less institutional expenses), in contrast, are based on the number of enrollees and significant estimating risk relating to institutional utilization and associated costs incurred by assigned health plan enrollees. the medical groups also receive other incentive payments from health plans based on specified performance and quality criteria and the amounts accrued when earned can be reasonably estimated. differences between actual contract settlements and estimated receivables and payables are recorded in the year of final settlement. in 2013, dmg obtained a restricted knox-keene license in california, which now permits dmg to enter into contracts with health plans allowing it to recognize revenue under global capitation arrangements for both professional and institutional services.
impairments of long-lived assets. we account for impairments of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, equity investments in non-consolidated businesses, amortizable intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance. goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for valuation impairment as circumstances warrant and at least annually. an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. impairment reviews on other long-lived assets are also performed at least annually and whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable.
such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans, changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners, changes in reimbursement rates, or deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers or other operations. we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use. such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized, as well as market values and conditions. the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions. any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value.
accounting for income taxes. our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations, assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pre-tax operating income
91
adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets.
variable compensation accruals. we estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate-specific and/or corporate financial and operating goals. our estimates, which include compensation incentives for bonuses and other awards, including long-term incentive programs, are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final payment amount. actual results reflected in each fiscal quarter may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and/or corporate goals, as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our board of directors, as applicable.
consolidation of variable interest entities. we rely on the operating activities of certain entities that we do not directly own or control, but over which we have indirect influence and of which we are considered the primary beneficiary. under accounting guidance applicable to variable interest entities, we have determined that these entities are to be included in our consolidated financial statements. the analyses upon which these determinations rest are complex, involve uncertainties, and require significant judgment on various matters, some of which could be subject to reasonable disagreement. while these determinations have a meaningful effect on the description and classification of various amounts in our consolidated financial statements, non-consolidation of these entities would not have had a material effect on our results of operations.
purchase accounting valuation estimates. we make various assumptions and estimates regarding the valuation of tangible and intangible assets, liabilities, contingent earn-out consideration, noncontrolling interests and contractual as well as non-contractual contingencies associated with our acquisitions. these assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense and any contingent earn-out adjustments that will be recognized in the future.
fair value estimates. we have recorded certain assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests (temporary equity) subject to put provisions at fair value. the fasb defines fair value which is measured based upon certain valuation techniques that include inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions. we have measured the fair values of our applicable assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions based upon certain market inputs and assumptions that are either observable or unobservable in determining fair values and have also classified these assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions into the appropriate fair value hierarchy levels. the fair value of our investments available for sale are based upon quoted market prices from active markets and the fair value of our swap and cap agreements were based upon valuation models utilizing the income approach and commonly accepted valuation techniques that use inputs from closing prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets as well as other relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals such as current interest rates, forward yield curves, implied volatility and credit default swap pricing. the fair value of funds on deposit with third parties are based primarily on quoted close or bid market prices of the same or similar assets. the fair value of our contingent earn-out considerations were primarily based upon unobservable inputs including projected ebitda, the estimated probabilities of achieving other performance targets and the estimated probability of the earn-out payments being made by using option pricing techniques and simulation models of expected ebitda and operating income and other performance targets. for our noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions we have estimated the fair values based upon either the higher of a liquidation value of net assets or an average multiple of earnings based on historical earnings, patient mix and other performance indicators that can affect future results, as well as other factors. the estimate of the fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions involves significant judgments and assumptions and may not be indicative of the actual values at which the noncontrolling interests may ultimately be settled, which could vary significantly from our current estimates. the estimated fair values of the noncontrolling interests subject to put provisions can also fluctuate and the implicit multiple of earnings at which these noncontrolling interests obligations may be settled will vary depending upon market conditions including potential purchasers' access to the capital markets, which can impact the level of competition for dialysis and non-dialysis related businesses, the economic performance of these businesses and the restricted marketability of the third-party owners' equity interests.
stock-based compensation. stock-based compensation awards are measured at their estimated fair values on the date of grant if settled in shares or at their estimated fair values at the end of each reporting period if settled in cash. the value of stock-based awards so measured is recognized as compensation expense on a cumulative straight-line basis over the vesting terms of the awards, adjusted for expected forfeitures. we estimate the fair value of stock awards using complex option pricing models that rely heavily on estimates from us about uncertain future events, including the expected term of the awards, the expected future volatility of our stock price, and expected future risk-free interest rates.
medical liability claims associated with dmg. the medical groups are responsible for the medical services that associated physicians and contracted hospitals provide to assigned hmo enrollees. we provide medical services to health plan enrollees through a network of contracted providers under sub-capitation and ffs arrangements, company-operated clinics and staff physicians. medical costs for professional and institutional services rendered by contracted providers are recorded as medical expenses and hospital
92
expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statements of income. costs for operating medical clinics, including the salaries of medical and non-medical personnel and support costs, are recorded in clinic support and other operating costs.
an estimate of amounts due to contracted physicians, hospitals, and other professional providers is included in medical payables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. medical claims payable include claims reported as of the balance sheet date and incurred but not reported (ibnr) estimates. such estimates are developed using actuarial methods and are based on many variables, including the utilization of healthcare services, historical payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, changes in membership, and other factors. the estimation methods and the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated. many of the medical contracts are complex in nature and may be subject to differing interpretations regarding amounts due for the provision of various services. we engage a third-party actuary to assist in the evaluation of the estimated ibnr reserves. such differing interpretations may not come to light until a substantial period of time has passed following the contract implementation. any adjustments to reserves are reflected in current operations.
significant new accounting standards see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information regarding certain recent accounting standards that have been issued by the fasb.
